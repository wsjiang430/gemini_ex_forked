ITEM 1. Business
General Description of Our Business
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of programmed cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders. We are developing first-in-class cell therapy product candidates based on a simple notion: we believe that better cell therapies start with better cells. 
 To create better cell therapies, we use a therapeutic approach that we generally refer to as cell programming. For certain of our cell therapy product candidates, we use pharmacologic modulators, such as small molecules, to enhance the biological properties and therapeutic function of healthy donor cells ex vivo before our product candidates are administered to a patient. In other cases, we use human iPSCs to generate a clonal master iPSC line having preferred biological properties, and direct the fate of the clonal master iPSC line to create our cell therapy product candidate. Analogous to master cell lines used to manufacture biopharmaceutical drug products such as monoclonal antibodies, we believe clonal master iPSC lines can be made and used as a renewable source for manufacturing cell therapy products which are well-defined and uniform in composition, can be repeatedly mass produced at significant scale in a cost-effective manner, and can be delivered off-the-shelf to treat many patients.  
 Utilizing these therapeutic approaches, we program cells of the blood and immune system, including natural killer (NK) cells, T cells and CD34+ cells, and are advancing a pipeline of programmed cellular immunotherapies in the therapeutic areas of immuno-oncology and immuno-regulation.

 Our Cell Programming Approach
 The use of human cells as therapeutic entities has disease-transforming potential, and compelling evidence of their medical benefit exists across a broad spectrum of severe, life-threatening diseases. One of the most successful and widespread applications of cell therapy is hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), with over 60,000 procedures performed worldwide on an annual basis. HCT holds curative potential for patients afflicted with hematologic malignancies, such as leukemia and lymphoma, and with rare genetic disorders, such as hemoglobinopathies, inherited metabolic disorders and immune deficiencies.
 Building upon this well-established medical precedent, the clinical investigation of hematopoietic cells, including NK cells, T cells and CD34+ cells, as therapies for the treatment of human diseases is rapidly expanding. Many of these clinical trials are investigating transformative applications in the field of cancer immunotherapy to control, and potentially eradicate, tumor growth. One particular form of cancer immunotherapy, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, has recently emerged as a revolutionary and potentially curative therapy for patients with certain hematologic malignancies; in fact, in 2017, two CAR T-cell therapies were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). While advancements in the sourcing, engineering and expansion of cells have opened new avenues for their use as therapeutic entities, we believe the biological properties and therapeutic function of cells can be enhanced ex vivo prior to patient administration to maximize therapeutic benefit.
 We are using advanced molecular characterization tools and technologies to identify small molecule and biologic modulators that promote rapid and supra-physiologic activation or inhibition of therapeutically-relevant genes and cell-surface proteins, such as those involved in the homing, proliferation and survival of CD34+ cells or those involved in the persistence, proliferation and anti-tumor activity of NK cells and T cells. We apply our deep understanding of the hematopoietic system to rapidly assess and quantify the potential therapeutic benefits of ex vivo cell programming in the settings of cancer and immune disorders. We believe that this

highly differentiated therapeutic approach – systematically and precisely programming the biological properties and therapeutic function of cells ex vivo prior to adoptive transfer – is a reproducible, scalable and cost-effective approach to maximize the safety and efficacy of cell therapies.
 Human iPSCs, with their unique dual capacity to be indefinitely expanded and differentiated in culture into any type of cell in the body, hold revolutionary potential for creating better cell therapies. The groundbreaking discovery that fully differentiated human cells can be induced to a pluripotent state through the expression of certain genes was recognized with the 2012 Nobel Prize in Science and Medicine. We believe iPSCs can be used to overcome key limitations inherent in many of the cell therapy product candidates undergoing development today, including the requirement to source, isolate, engineer and expand cells from an individual patient or healthy donor with each batch of production. These batch-to-batch manufacturing requirements are logistically complex and expensive, and can result in variable cell product identity, purity and potency as well as manufacturing failures. 
 Analogous to master cell lines used to manufacture biopharmaceutical drug products such as monoclonal antibodies, we believe clonal master iPSC lines can be made and used as a renewable source for manufacturing cell therapy products which are well-defined and uniform in composition, can be repeatedly mass produced at significant scale in a cost-effective manner, and can be delivered off-the-shelf to treat many patients.
 We are applying our expertise in iPSC biology to genetically engineer, isolate and select single-cell iPSCs for clonal expansion, characterization and cryopreservation as clonal master iPSC lines. We direct the fate of clonal master iPSC lines to create cells of the immune system, including NK cells, T cells and CD34+ cells, and are advancing a pipeline of off-the-shelf cellular immunotherapies derived from clonal master iPSC lines. Our iPSC product platform is supported by an intellectual property portfolio of over 100 issued patents and 100 pending patent applications that we own or license. 
 Our Business Strategy
 Cellular immunotherapies undergoing clinical investigation today most often rely on the use of a patient’s own cells. The requirement to source, engineer, expand and deliver cells patient-by-patient is logistically complex, resource intensive and expensive, and can result in significant batch-to-batch variability in product identity, purity and potency as well as in manufacturing failures. Significant hurdles remain to ensure that cellular immunotherapies can be consistently manufactured and reliably delivered, in a cost-effective manner and at the scale necessary, to support broad patient access and wide-spread commercialization.
 Rather than rely on the use of a patient’s own cells, we seek to use healthy donor cells and clonal master iPSC lines to manufacture, develop and commercialize first-in-class cellular immunotherapies in the therapeutic areas of immuno-oncology and immuno-regulation. We believe our approach has the potential to improve cell product consistency and potency, reduce manufacturing costs, shorten time to treatment and reach more patients. The key pillars of our business strategy are to:
  
• | Efficiently develop and commercialize first-in-class allogeneic cellular immunotherapies for severe, life-threatening diseases where treatment options are limited. We are clinically developing first-in-class allogeneic cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders. We are advancing our product candidates to improve the lives of patients with severe, life-threatening diseases, where the unmet need is significant and where regulatory agencies offer efficient and expedited development and review programs. For example, we are developing our product candidate ProTmune as a first-in-class hematopoietic cell graft for the prevention of life-threatening complications, including graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), in patients undergoing allogeneic HCT. GvHD is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing allogeneic HCT, and there are currently no therapies approved by the FDA for the prevention of GvHD. The FDA has granted Fast Track designation, and the FDA and the European Commission have granted Orphan Drug Designation and Orphan Medicinal Product Designation, respectively, for ProTmune. We are also developing our product candidate FATE-NK100, which is manufactured using healthy donor cells, as a first-in-class, adaptive memory NK cell cancer immunotherapy. FATE-NK100 is currently being clinically investigated in three Phase 1 studies for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies and advanced solid tumors. Due to high incidences of morbidity and mortality and the rare disease nature of many of our target indications, we believe clinical trials that we conduct will generally require relatively small numbers of subjects and that our development path to approval may be efficient.

• | Exploit our dominant leadership position in iPSC technology to develop and commercialize universal, off-the-shelf cell products for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. We have developed an industry-leading iPSC product platform, and we believe the manufacture of cell products using clonal master iPSC lines has the potential to revolutionize the field of cancer immunotherapy. Our first-of-kind approach involves engineering human iPSCs in a one-time genetic modification event, and selecting a single iPSC for maintenance as a clonal master iPSC line. Analogous to master cell lines used to manufacture biopharmaceutical drug products such as monoclonal antibodies, we believe clonal master iPSC lines can be used as a renewable source for manufacturing cell therapy products which are well-defined and uniform in composition, can be repeatedly mass produced at significant scale in a cost-effective manner, and can be delivered off-the-shelf to treat many patients.

We have amassed unrivaled expertise in the manufacture of NK cells and T cells from clonal master iPSC lines. Our expertise includes: generating, engineering, isolating and characterizing single-cell iPSC clones; creating and cryopreserving clonal master iPSC lines; differentiating these clonal master cell lines to produce NK cells and T cells; and regulatory affairs to enable clinical investigation of iPSC-derived cell products. We believe our iPSC-derived NK cell and T-cell product candidates have the potential to be administered in multi-dose, multi-cycle treatment regimens, including in combination with cycles of other cancer treatments, to drive deeper and more durable responses. In November 2018, the FDA cleared our IND application for FT500, a universal, off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived NK cell product candidate for use in combination with checkpoint blockade therapy for the treatment of solid tumors; and in February 2019, the FDA cleared our IND application for FT516, a universal, off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived NK cell product candidate that expresses a high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 Fc receptor for use in combination with monoclonal antibody therapy for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. FT500 is the first-ever iPSC-derived cell therapy, and FT516 is the first-ever engineered iPSC-derived cell therapy, allowed to proceed to clinical investigation in the United States by the FDA.
  
• | Forge collaborations with leading researchers and top medical centers to accelerate development of and rapidly translate our iPSC-derived cell product candidates into first-in-human clinical trials. The research and development of iPSC-derived cell product candidates requires an exceptional team of people and scientific, manufacturing and clinical expertise across a range of disciplines. We have and will continue to seek collaborations with leading researchers, investigators and top medical centers for the research, development, manufacture and clinical translation of our iPSC-derived cell product candidates. Among our collaborations is a partnership with the University of Minnesota, led by Dr. Jeffrey S. Miller, a renowned NK cell biologist and clinical investigator, to support the development of FT500 and FT516 product candidates, and a partnership with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, led by Dr. Michel Sadelain, a renowned T-cell biologist and a recognized founder of CAR T-cell therapy, to support the development of engineered iPSC-derived CAR T-cell immunotherapies, including FT819. We believe this approach to research and development will maximize our potential to successfully build our iPSC product platform, accelerate the clinical translation and clinical investigation of our iPSC-derived cell product candidates, and efficiently establish clinical proof-of-concept for our iPSC-derived cell product candidates.

• | Selectively share our iPSC product platform with industry-leading strategic partners for the development of highly differentiated cellular immunotherapies. The research, development and clinical investigation of cell therapies for the treatment of human diseases is rapidly expanding. We believe we are uniquely positioned as an expert partner of choice for industry-leading developers seeking to maximize the therapeutic potential of cell therapies for the treatment of cancer. Additionally, since iPSCs have the unique capacity to be genetically engineered, indefinitely expanded and differentiated in culture into any type of cell in the body, we believe there is significant opportunity to broadly exploit our industry-leading iPSC product platform and intellectual property position into other disease areas. We will continue to seek partnerships with institutions and companies for the research, development and commercialization of iPSC-derived cell product candidates for the treatment of human diseases.

Our Product Pipeline & Partnerships
 Immuno-Oncology Product Candidates
 Natural killer (NK) cells have an innate ability to rapidly seek and destroy abnormal cells, such as cancer or virally-infected cells, and represent one of the body’s first lines of immunological defense. NK cells have the unique ability to selectively identify and destroy abnormal cells through multiple mechanisms while leaving normal healthy cells unharmed. These cytotoxic mechanisms include: direct killing by binding to stress ligands expressed by abnormal cells and releasing toxic granules; indirect killing by producing and releasing proinflammatory and chemotactic cytokines that play a pivotal role in orchestrating the adaptive immune response; and antibody-mediated targeted killing by binding to and enhancing the cancer-killing effect of therapeutic antibodies through a process known as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).
 T cells, or T lymphocytes, play a critical role in adaptive immunity and are distinguished from other cells of the immune system by the presence of a T-cell receptor (TCR) on their surface. TCRs are generated by DNA rearrangement and positively selected for their capacity to engage host major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. The majority of T cells, termed alpha beta T cells (αβ T cells), rearrange their alpha and beta chains on the TCR, which confers specificity and enables T cells to recognize non-self molecules, known as non-self antigens, expressed on the surface of transformed or foreign cells. Antigens inside a cell are bound to, and are routinely brought to the surface of a cell, by MHC class I molecules. Upon antigen recognition, T cells bind to the MHC-antigen complex, become activated and destroy the targeted cell. Many of the antigens recognized by T cells are those expressed on the surface of cancer cells. Unlike NK cells, T cells are limited by antigen-specific binding of their TCR in order to induce cellular cytotoxicity.
 We are developing NK cell and T-cell cancer immunotherapies with a focus on developing next-generation cell products intended to synergize with checkpoint inhibitor and monoclonal antibody therapies and to target tumor-associated antigens.

FATE-NK100 Adaptive Memory Natural Killer Cell Product Candidate
 Adaptive memory NK cells are a highly specialized and functionally distinct subset of NK cells. In July 2015, we entered into a research collaboration with the University of Minnesota led by Dr. Jeffrey S. Miller, Professor of Medicine at the University of Minnesota and Deputy Director of the University of Minnesota Masonic Comprehensive Cancer Center, to develop an adaptive memory NK cell product candidate for cancer. In the setting of allogeneic HCT, a retrospective study by investigators at the University of Minnesota found that HCT recipients with a high absolute number of adaptive memory NK cells (>2.5 cells/μl of blood; n=54) at six months post-HCT had a 2-year disease relapse rate of 16%, as compared to 46% in recipients with a low absolute number of adaptive memory NK cells (0.1–2.5 cells/μl of blood; n=16). Additionally, published preclinical findings from the University of Minnesota investigators demonstrated that adaptive memory NK cells have enhanced effector function, long-term persistence and greater resistance to immune checkpoint pathways.
 We are developing FATE-NK100, a first-in-class NK cell cancer immunotherapy comprised of adaptive memory NK cells. Through the application of our cell programming expertise and our specific knowledge of modulators involved in the persistence, proliferation and anti-tumor activity of immune cells, we identified a combination of pharmacological modulators consisting of a cytokine and a small molecule (FT1238) that induces the robust formation of adaptive memory NK cells in therapeutically-relevant quantities. We produce FATE-NK100 using these pharmacological modulators in a seven-day manufacturing process. In August 2017, preclinical data describing the unique properties and anti-tumor activity of FATE-NK100 were published in Cancer Research (doi:10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0799), a peer-reviewed journal of the American Association of Cancer Research.  As described in the publication, we have observed in preclinical studies that FATE-NK100 has enhanced anti-tumor activity across a broad range of liquid and solid tumors, improved persistence and increased resistance to immune checkpoint pathways as compared to conventional NK cell therapies that are being clinically administered today. Additionally, we have observed in preclinical studies that FATE-NK100 significantly augments ADCC against cancer cells when administered in combination with a monoclonal antibody, including antibodies that target CD20, HER2 and EGFR antigens.
 FATE-NK100 is produced using the peripheral blood of a healthy donor in a feeder-free, seven-day manufacturing process during which NK cells are programmed ex vivo with our combination of pharmacological modulators. While patient-specific T cells are most commonly utilized in cancer immunotherapy, NK cells sourced from healthy donors have been safely administered to patients for over a decade without eliciting GvHD or triggering significant side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome. FATE-NK100 is currently being evaluated in three clinical trials.
 The VOYAGE Study. VOYAGE is an ongoing open-label, accelerated dose-escalation, Phase 1 clinical trial of FATE-NK100 as a monotherapy in subjects with refractory or relapsed acute myelogenous lymphoma (AML). The clinical trial is designed to assess the safety and determine the maximum dose of a single intravenous infusion of FATE-NK100 as a monotherapy when administered after lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by a short course of sub-cutaneous interleukin-2 (IL-2) administration. Up to three dose levels of FATE-NK100 are intended to be assessed using an accelerated dose-escalation design, proceeding in cohorts of one subject per dose level until a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed. If a DLT is observed at a dose level, a cohort of three subjects will be enrolled at that dose level. If, at any time, more than one subject at a dose level experiences a DLT, the dose level shall be considered to exceed the maximum dose level and dose escalation will stop. A total of ten subjects is expected to be enrolled at the maximum dose level.
 In November 2018, we reported initial clinical data from the ongoing VOYAGE study as of an October 22, 2018 data cutoff. As of that date, a total of four subjects, each with refractory or relapsed disease at the time of enrollment, were treated with a single infusion of FATE-NK100 as monotherapy. All three subjects treated at the second dose level (1-3x107 cells per kg) achieved a morphologic leukemia-free state at Day 14 as assessed by bone marrow biopsy; however, the anti-leukemic activity in each of these three subjects was transient, and each of these three subjects subsequently had progressive disease. No subjects treated at the first two dose levels achieved a complete response. No DLTs or serious adverse events related to FATE-NK100 were reported. A DLT unrelated to FATE-NK100 was reported in one subject at the second dose level.
 The Phase 1 clinical trial is currently being conducted at the Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota as an investigator-sponsored study.
 The APOLLO Study. APOLLO is an ongoing open-label, accelerated dose-escalation, Phase 1 clinical trial of FATE-NK100 as a monotherapy in women with ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer resistant to, or recurrent on, platinum-based treatment. The clinical trial is designed to assess the safety and determine the maximum dose of a single infusion via intraperitoneal catheter of FATE-NK100 as a monotherapy when administered after outpatient lymphoconditioning chemotherapy followed by a short course of sub-cutaneous IL-2 administration. Up to three dose levels of FATE-NK100 are intended to be assessed using an accelerated dose-escalation design, proceeding in cohorts of one subject per dose level until a DLT is observed. If, at any time, more than one subject at a dose level experiences a DLT, the dose level shall be considered to exceed the maximum dose level and dose escalation will stop. A total of ten subjects is expected to be enrolled at the maximum dose level.

In November 2018, we reported initial clinical data from the ongoing APOLLO study as of an October 22, 2018 data cutoff. As of that date, a total of four subjects, each with progressive disease at the time of enrollment, were treated with a single infusion of FATE-NK100 as monotherapy. One subject at the second dose level (1-3x107 cells per kg) had stable disease at one-month follow-up, was treated with a second dose of FATE-NK100, and remained on study and maintained disease control for 6.2 months. Three other subjects, one each at the first dose level (1x107 cells per kg), the second dose level and the third dose level (3-10x107 cells per kg) had progressive disease at one-month follow-up. No DLTs were reported. One serious adverse event related to FATE-NK100 was reported (Grade 3: abdominal pain).
 The Phase 1 clinical trial is currently being conducted at the Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota as an investigator-sponsored study.
 The DIMENSION Study. DIMENSION is an open-label, accelerated dose-escalation, Phase 1 clinical trial of FATE-NK100 as a monotherapy and in combination with monoclonal antibody therapy in subjects with advanced solid tumors who have failed approved therapies. The clinical trial is designed to assess the safety and determine the maximum dose of a single intravenous infusion of FATE-NK100 when administered after outpatient lymphoconditioning chemotherapy followed by a short course of sub-cutaneous IL-2 administration. The DIMENSION study is designed with three treatment regimens: 

• | Regimen A: FATE-NK100 as a monotherapy in subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies. Up to three dose levels of FATE-NK100 are intended to be assessed using an accelerated dose-escalation design. In the event a DLT is observed, the clinical trial will convert immediately to a traditional 3+3 design. We intend to have the third dose level follow a traditional 3+3 design to confirm tolerability. A twenty-subject expansion cohort is expected to be enrolled at the maximum dose level.

• | Regimen B: FATE-NK100 in combination with trastuzumab in subjects with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) advanced breast cancer, HER2+ advanced gastric cancer or other advanced HER2+ solid tumors. Up to four dose levels of FATE-NK100 are intended to be assessed using an accelerated dose-escalation design. In the event a DLT is observed, the clinical trial will convert immediately to a traditional 3+3 design. We intend to have the third and fourth dose levels follow a traditional 3+3 design to confirm tolerability. A twenty-subject expansion cohort is expected to be enrolled at the maximum dose level.

• | Regimen C: FATE-NK100 in combination with cetuximab in subjects with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) or head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC), or other epidermal growth factor receptor 1 positive (EGFR1+) advanced solid tumors. Up to four dose levels of FATE-NK100 are intended to be assessed using an accelerated dose-escalation design. In the event a DLT is observed, the clinical trial will convert immediately to a traditional 3+3 design. We intend to have the third and fourth dose levels follow a traditional 3+3 design to confirm tolerability. A twenty-subject expansion cohort is expected to be enrolled at the maximum dose level.

 In November 2018, we reported initial clinical data from the ongoing DIMENSION study as of an October 22, 2018 data cutoff. As of that date, one-month follow up data were available for seven subjects, each with progressive disease at the time of enrollment following multiple prior lines of therapy. Three of five subjects treated with FATE-NK100 in the monotherapy regimen had stable disease at one-month follow-up: one subject treated at the second dose level (1-3x107 cells per kg) and two subjects treated at the third dose level (3-10x107 cells per kg). These two subjects at the third dose level each received a second dose of FATE-NK100, and remained on study with ongoing disease control as of the data cutoff (94 and 149 days, respectively). The two other subjects in the monotherapy regimen (one subject at the first dose level (1x107 cells per kg) and one subject at the third dose level) had progressive disease at one-month follow-up. Each of the two subjects in the cetuximab combination regimen had progressive disease at one-month follow-up: one subject at the run-in dose level (1x106 cells per kg) and one subject at the first dose level (1x107 cells per kg). No DLTs were reported, and no serious adverse events related to FATE-NK100 were reported. 
 FT500: iPSC-derived NK Cell Product Candidate for Checkpoint Inhibitor Combination
 Therapies that block inhibitory immunological signaling pathways have transformed the oncology landscape. For example, the use of monoclonal antibody-based therapies commonly referred to as checkpoint inhibitors, which target the PD1 receptor upregulated on activated T cells or its ligands (programmed death ligands 1 and 2 (PD-L1 and PD-L2)) expressed on tumor cells, have achieved long term remissions in multiple tumor indications. Unfortunately, more than 60% of patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors will not respond or will relapse. As a result, there is significant unmet need for novel therapeutic approaches to overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibitors.
 One common mechanism of intrinsic and acquired resistance to checkpoint inhibitors is deletions or loss of heterozygosity in beta-2-microglobulin, or B2M, an essential component of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules which play a critical role in tumor-antigen presentation. A recent longitudinal analysis in a cohort of patients treated with several checkpoint inhibitors identified B2M expression defects in approximately 30% of patients with progressing disease. In fact, loss of heterozygosity in B2M was found to be enriched three-fold in non-responders (~30%) vs. responders (~10%) and was associated with poor overall survival. Additionally, complete loss of B2M expression was found only in non-responders. These findings suggest that defects in B2M expression can contribute to tumor evasion of T-cell responses and disease progression.
 7


One potential strategy to overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibitors, especially in patients whose heterogenous tumor burden includes B2M expression defects, is through the administration of allogeneic NK cells, which have the inherent capability to recognize and directly kill cells with MHC class I down-regulation. The mechanism of killing is through the release of perforins exposing large amounts of tumor antigens and through the secretion of a number of cytokines and chemokines, both of which can activate and facilitate an adaptive immune response. In addition to direct cytotoxicity, NK cells can also secrete proinflammatory cytokines, which can induce tumor-resident T cells to re-engage and elicit an anti-tumor response, and chemotactic cytokines, which can recruit T cells to the tumor site. As such, allogeneic donor NK cells may have the potential to overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibitors in certain patients by directly killing tumor cells and by potentiating an adaptive immune response. 
 We are developing FT500 as a universal, off-the-shelf NK cell cancer immunotherapy for the treatment of advanced solid tumors, both as a monotherapy and in combination with FDA-approved checkpoint inhibitor therapy. We isolated and selected a single iPSC, and clonally-expanded this single iPSC to generate the clonal master iPSC line for production of FT500. Using a proprietary, efficient and reproducible differentiation process, we have shown that one iPSC can create over one million NK cells, providing a substantially pure population of NK cells that is well-defined and of uniform composition. In preclinical studies, FT500 displays multiple potential mechanisms by which it may synergize with T cells to activate the immune system in patients with tumors that are non-responsive to checkpoint inhibitors alone. In particular, in an in vitro three-dimensional tumor spheroid model, FT500 in combination with activated T cells and an anti-PD1 antibody significantly enhanced the elimination of target cancer cells, as compared to FT500 alone, activated T cells alone and activated T cells in combination with anti-PD1 antibody.
 In November 2018, the FDA issued a letter informing us that our FT500 IND application was allowed and that we can proceed with human clinical investigation of FT500. To our knowledge, FT500 is the first-ever iPSC-derived cell therapy cleared by the FDA for clinical investigation in the United States.
 Our clinical trial of FT500 is expected to be the first-ever clinical investigation in the U.S. of an iPSC-derived cell product. The open-label, multi-center, repeat-dose, multi-cycle, dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical trial is designed to assess the safety and determine the maximum dose of FT500 when administered after outpatient lymphoconditioning chemotherapy in up to 64 subjects with advanced solid tumors. The study includes two treatment regimens: FT500 as a monotherapy in subjects that are candidates for salvage therapy; and, in subjects who have failed or progressed on checkpoint inhibitor therapy (nivolumab, pembrolizumab or atezolizumab), FT500 in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor on which the subject has failed or progressed. The study will assess three once weekly doses of FT500 (Day 1, Day 8, Day 15); a second treatment cycle of three once weekly doses of FT500 may be administered for certain subjects who are clinically stable at Day 29. In the checkpoint inhibitor treatment regimen, subjects will receive treatment with the checkpoint inhibitor on which the subject had most recently progressed at the respective FDA-approved dose beginning on Day 8. Up to two dose levels of FT500 are intended to be assessed (1 x 108 cells per dose and 3 x 108 cells per dose) with the potential for higher doses to be defined by protocol amendment. In February 2019, the first subject was treated with FT500, and the clinical trial is now open for enrollment at two top cancer treatment centers.
 FT516: iPSC-derived, hnCD16 Engineered NK Cell Product Candidate for Monoclonal Antibody Combination
 NK cells play a major role in the anti-tumor efficacy of certain tumor-antigen targeting monoclonal antibodies. NK cells express CD16, an activating receptor that can bind to the Fc portion of IgG antibodies and transmit immune response signals. Once activated through CD16, NK cells are able to lyse antibody-coated target cells and secrete cytokines, such as interferon gamma, to recruit and potentiate adaptive immune cells, including T cells. This mechanism of ADCC has been proven critical to the treatment of a wide range of human tumor types.
 The anti-tumor efficacy of several FDA-approved monoclonal antibody therapies, including trastuzumab (FDA-approved for certain breast and gastric cancers), cetuximab (FDA-approved for certain head and neck, non-small cell lung and colorectal cancers) and rituximab (FDA-approved for certain cancers of the blood and lymph system), has been shown to be NK cell-dependent. Additionally, a number of clinical studies with these FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated that their anti-tumor efficacy is significantly enhanced in patients having a single nucleotide polymorphism resulting in the expression of a high-affinity CD16 isoform with increased strength of binding to IgG antibodies. Only about 10% of humans are homozygous for this allele. 
 We are developing FT516, a targeted NK cell product candidate which is created from a master clonal iPSC line engineered to express a high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor, as an off-the-shelf immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer. Our novel hnCD16 Fc receptor incorporates two unique modifications designed to augment the receptor’s binding affinity to IgG antibodies and to block the shedding of the receptor’s expression on the surface of NK cells upon activation. We have engineered iPSCs to express this novel hnCD16 Fc receptor, isolated and selected a single engineered iPSC, and clonally-expanded this single engineered iPSC to generate the clonal master engineered iPSC line for production of FT516. Using a proprietary, efficient and reproducible differentiation process, we have shown that one iPSC can create over one million NK cells, providing a substantially pure population of NK cells that is well-defined and of uniform composition.

We are developing FT516 as a monotherapy and in combination with tumor-antigen targeting monoclonal antibody therapy for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. We have shown that FT516 exhibits potent and persistent anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo in multiple tumor cell recognition and killing assays:
  
• | FT516 exhibits superior direct killing in combination with each of rituximab, trastuzumab and cetuximab in vitro, as compared to conventional NK cells sourced from peripheral blood and cord blood, in a killing assay of a human lymphoma cell line positive for CD20 (rituximab) and a human ovarian cancer cell line that is positive for both HER2 (trastuzumab) and EGFR expression (cetuximab);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FT516 shows a dose-dependent killing response in combination with rituximab in vitro in a CD20+ human lymphoblast-derived B-lymphocyte cell line killing assay;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FT516 augments anti-tumor activity in combination with trastuzumab in vivo, as compared to mice treated with trastuzumab alone, in a HER2+ ovarian cancer model, where the anti-tumor activity at Week 6 of FT516 plus trastuzumab was durable with no tumor detectable by imaging in 80% of the mice as compared to trastuzumab alone where all mice displayed tumor burden; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FT516 augments anti-tumor activity and promotes prolonged survival in combination with rituximab in vivo, as compared to expanded peripheral blood NK cells in combination with rituximab, in a human lymphoma cancer model, where FT516 in combination with rituximab supported a survival rate of 50% at Day 200.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In April 2018, we executed an award agreement with the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) pursuant to which CIRM awarded us up to $4.0 million to advance our FT516 product candidate into a first-in-human clinical trial for the treatment of subjects with advanced solid tumors, including in combination with monoclonal antibody therapy (the Award). Pursuant to the terms of the Award, we are eligible to receive five disbursements in varying amounts throughout the project period of the Award, which was estimated to be from April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019. The Award is subject to certain co-funding requirements by us, and we are required to provide progress and financial update reports to CIRM. We, in our sole discretion, have the option to treat the Award either as a loan or as a grant. If we do not elect to treat the Award as a loan within 10 years of the date of the Award, the Award will be considered a grant. 
 In December 2018, we discussed with CIRM our intent to pursue the clinical development of FT516 in relapsed / refractory hematologic malignancies in addition to advanced solid tumors, and our preference to first submit an IND application for FT516 in relapsed / refractory hematologic malignancies rather than in advanced solid tumors. In January 2019, we submitted our IND application for FT516 in relapsed / refractory hematologic malignancies, the second product candidate intended for clinical investigation emerging from our iPSC product platform, which IND submission was allowed by the FDA in a letter from February 2019. Such letter from the FDA also informed us that we could proceed with human clinical investigation of FT516. We are currently developing a clinical protocol to support a potential submission of an IND application for FT516 in advanced solid tumors. We agreed with CIRM to suspend the Award until such time as we elect to proceed with our submission of an IND application for FT516 in advanced solid tumors. At the time of suspension, an additional $0.5 million was available for funding under the Award.
 
Our clinical trial of FT516 is expected to be the first-ever clinical investigation of an engineered iPSC-derived cell product. The open-label, multi-center, repeat-dose, multi-cycle, dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical trial is designed to assess the safety and determine the maximum dose of FT516 when administered after outpatient lymphoconditioning chemotherapy followed by a short course of sub-cutaneous IL-2 administration in up to 99 subjects with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies. The study includes three treatment regimens: FT516 as a monotherapy in subjects with AML; FT516 in combination with rituximab in subjects with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL); and FT516 in combination with elotuzumab in subjects with multiple myeloma (MM). The study will assess three once weekly doses of FT516 (Day 1, Day 8, Day 15); a second treatment cycle of three once weekly doses of FT516 may be administered for certain subjects who are clinically stable at Day 29. In the monoclonal antibody treatment regimens, subjects will receive treatment with the monoclonal antibody beginning four days prior to the first administration of FT500. Up to four dose levels of FT516 are intended to be assessed (0.3 x 108 cells per dose (monoclonal antibody regimens only); 1 x 108 cells per dose; 3 x 108 cells per dose; 9 x 108 cells per dose).
 Additional iPSC-derived Cell Product Candidates for Cancer
 We are applying our iPSC product platform to develop other clonal master engineered iPSC lines and additional engineered iPSC-derived cell product candidates, including in collaboration with leading researchers and top medical centers. For example, we entered into a multi-year research collaboration with the University of California, San Diego to develop off-the-shelf, CAR-NK cell cancer immunotherapies. The collaboration is being led by Dan S. Kaufman, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine in the Division of Regenerative Medicine and Director of Cell Therapy at UC San Diego School of Medicine. We also entered into a multi-year partnership with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for the development of off-the-shelf engineered T-cell product candidates using clonal master iPSC lines. The research and development activities under the collaboration are being led by Dr. Michel Sadelain, Director of the Center for Cell Engineering and the Stephen and Barbara Friedman Chair at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

FT596.  CAR T-cell therapy has recently emerged as a revolutionary and potentially curative therapy for patients with hematologic malignancies, including refractory cancers. In 2017, two autologous CD19-specific CAR T-cell therapies were approved by the FDA for the treatment of certain relapsed/refractory leukemias and lymphomas. While most researchers and clinical investigators continue to focus on the development of autologous CAR T-cell therapies, we are developing CAR NK cell product candidates created from clonal master engineered iPSC lines as off-the-shelf cancer immunotherapies for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.
 We are developing FT596, a universal, off-the-shelf CAR NK cell product candidate derived from a clonal master engineered iPSC line incorporating “CAR4”, a novel CAR construct specifically designed to augment NK cell signaling. CAR4 was developed by our collaborator Dr. Kaufman, and contains the transmembrane domain of NKG2D, the 2B4 co-stimulatory domain, and the CD3ζ signaling domain and mediates strong antigen-specific NK cell signaling in vitro. In preclinical studies using an ovarian cancer xenograft model, Dr. Kaufman has shown that iPSC-derived CAR4 NK cells markedly inhibit tumor growth and significantly prolong survival as compared to iPSC-derived NK cells containing a CAR construct commonly used with CAR T-cell therapy.
 FT596 is derived from a clonal master iPSC line engineered to include the expression of CD19-specific CAR4 to convey antigen specificity, a high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor to enhance ADCC, and a novel IL-15 receptor fusion for cytokine-independent persistence. Using a research iPSC line for production of FT596, we have shown in preclinical studies that FT596:
  
• | shows cytokine-free expansion in vitro and extended persistence in vivo in various immunocompromised mouse strains;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mediates CAR-directed specificity and cytotoxicity against multiple CD19-positive target cell lines in vitro;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mediates rituximab-induced ADCC against CD20-positive, CD19-negative ARH-77 and Raji target cell lines in vitro;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | promotes enhanced and extended survival in vivo compared to control groups in a CD19-positive Nalm6 xenograft model of leukemia; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completely eradicates, in combination with rituximab, CD19+ and CD19- target cell lines in vitro in a mixed-culture cytotoxicity assay.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 FT538. We are developing FT538, a universal, off-the-shelf NK cell product candidate derived from a clonal master engineered iPSC line, for use in combination with anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody therapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on MM cells. Daratumumab, which is the only FDA-approved monoclonal antibody that has demonstrated single agent efficacy in relapsed/refractory MM, effectively targets CD38 and induces MM cell death through multiple mechanisms, including ADCC. However, because CD38 is also expressed on the surface of activated NK cells, daratumumab treatment can induce NK cell fratricide, which likely impairs the effectiveness of ADCC-mediated targeting and elimination of MM cells. In addition, NK cell function is often suppressed or absent in patients with MM as a result of the cancer itself and/or from cancer therapy, further reducing the effectiveness of daratumumab. Collectively, preclinical and clinical observations suggest a potential therapeutic benefit of maintaining NK cell numbers and function in patients to support daratumumab-mediated ADCC and augment the treatment of MM. 
 FT538 is derived from a clonal master iPSC line engineered to include the expression of a hnCD16 Fc receptor to enhance ADCC and a novel IL-15 receptor fusion for cytokine-independent persistence, and to completely eliminate CD38 expression to mitigate NK cell fratricide. We have generated NK cells from master engineered iPSC lines, and have shown in preclinical studies that:
  
• | CD38 deficiency protected NK cells from fratricide mediated by daratumumab in vitro;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | hnCD16 iPSC-derived NK cells mediate robust anti-myeloma activity with daratumumab in vitro, which is further augmented by elimination of CD38 expression;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | hnCD16, CD38-null iPSC-derived NK cells demonstrate more durable ADCC with increased serial killing potential in combination with daratumumab in vitro; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | there is no significant difference in NK cell differentiation, expansion, activation or ability to mediate natural cytotoxicity between hnCD16, CD38-null iPSC-derived NK cells and hnCD16 iPSC-derived NK cells.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 FT819. We are developing CAR T-cell product candidates created from clonal master engineered iPSC lines as off-the-shelf cancer immunotherapies for the treatment of liquid and solid tumors. In September 2016, we announced a multi-year partnership with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for the development of off-the-shelf engineered T-cell product candidates using clonal master iPSC lines. Research and development activities under the collaboration are being led by Dr. Michel Sadelain, Director of the Center for Cell Engineering and the Stephen and Barbara Friedman Chair at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

In connection with the formation of our partnership with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, we exclusively licensed from Memorial Sloan Kettering foundational intellectual property covering iPSC-derived cellular immunotherapy, including T cells and NK cells derived from iPSCs engineered with CARs, for human therapeutic use. We also secured an exclusive option to exclusively license intellectual property arising from all research and development activities under the partnership. In May 2018, we licensed from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center additional intellectual property covering compositions of novel CAR constructs, including the 1XX CAR construct, and of genetically-engineered CAR T cells, including methods of making these cells using CRISPR for certain targeted gene modifications. Embodiments of this additional intellectual property include preclinical data published by Dr. Sadelain in March 2017 demonstrating that directing a CD19-specific CAR to the T-cell receptor α constant (TRAC) locus results in uniform CAR expression in human peripheral blood T cells, enhances T-cell potency, and delays effector T-cell differentiation and exhaustion, and in November 2018 demonstrating that CAR T cells utilizing a novel 1XX CAR signaling domain exhibited enhanced antitumor efficacy, persistence and long-term cytotoxicity as well as a decrease in T-cell exhaustion.
 We are developing FT819, a first-of-kind CD19-specific CAR T-cell product candidate derived from a clonal master engineered iPSC line. The engineered features of the clonal master iPSC line include the targeted integration of a CD19-specific 1XX CAR into the TRAC locus to convey antigen specificity, promote TRAC-regulated CAR expression and completely eliminate TCR expression to mitigate GvHD. We have generated CD8αβ+ T cells from master engineered iPSC lines, and have shown in preclinical studies that CD8αβ+ TCR-null, CD19-specific CAR T cells derived from master engineered iPSC lines: 
  
• | consist of bi-allelic disruption of TCR expression at the genetic level and demonstrate regulated expression of 1XX CAR under the control of the endogenous TRAC promoter;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | display antigen-specific anti-tumor potency in vitro, including cytokine release and targeted cellular cytotoxicity, comparable to peripheral blood CD19-specific CAR T cells;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | do not respond or proliferate against HLA-mismatched (CD19-) peripheral blood mononuclear cells as targets in a mixed lymphocyte reaction, indicating the risk of GvHD is alleviated; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | effectively control tumor progression in vivo comparable to peripheral blood CD19-specific CAR T cells in a preclinical mouse model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Other Immuno-Oncology Product Candidates.  We are applying our iPSC product platform to research and develop additional off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived cell product candidates. In November 2018, we entered into an exclusive option agreement with the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC) to obtain rights to intellectual property covering novel humanized CAR constructs that uniquely and specifically bind B-cell Maturation Antigen (BCMA). Under the agreement with MDC, we have the right to exclusively license the portfolio for all cell products, including CAR NK- and T-cell products, derived from iPSCs. In data published by MDC scientists, anti-BCMA CAR T cells equipped with its unique humanized extracellular antigen-binding domains show higher affinity and greater specificity than other anti-BCMA antigen-binding domains. These differentiated properties conveyed both greater selectivity in recognizing target B cells and more robust killing of target B cells in vitro, including malignant B cells with low expression levels of BCMA. Additionally, in in vivo proof-of-concept studies, MDC scientists demonstrated that anti-BCMA CAR T cells mediated anti-tumor activity in xenotransplant mouse models of multiple myeloma and of mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, where BCMA surface expression is up to 4-fold lower as compared to mouse models of multiple myeloma.
 Immuno-Regulation Product Candidates
 ProTmune™
 Allogeneic HCT has been performed globally for decades with curative intent in patients with a wide range of hematologic malignancies and rare genetic disorders. The procedure involves transferring donor-sourced hematopoietic cells to a patient following the administration of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. The biological properties of the various cell populations present in the donor-sourced hematopoietic cell graft play an essential role in determining outcomes of allogeneic HCT. Donor-sourced CD34+ cells have the unique ability to engraft and reconstitute a new blood and immune system, and donor-sourced immune cells, such as T cells, have an important protective role following HCT in eradicating residual cancer cells and providing protection against life-threatening infections. The engraftment of donor-sourced CD34+ cells is essential for successful reconstitution, and any delay in, or failure of, engraftment leaves a patient severely immuno-compromised and exposed to exceedingly high risk of early morbidity and mortality. Additionally, while the donor-sourced immune cells impart a critical immunotherapeutic effect, allo-reactive T cells can cause GvHD, a serious complication where donor-sourced T cells recognize antigens on a patient’s cells as foreign and attack the patient’s cells.
 According to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, approximately 30,000 allogeneic HCT procedures are performed globally each year. Hematopoietic cells for use in allogeneic HCT can be obtained from multiple donor sources including umbilical cord blood, bone marrow and mobilized peripheral blood (mPB). Approximately 65% of allogeneic HCT procedures utilize mPB as the donor hematopoietic cell source. While the use of mPB is associated with faster rates of neutrophil engraftment compared to other cell sources like bone marrow and umbilical cord blood, approximately 35-60% of patients undergoing 
 11


mPB HCT develop acute GvHD and 70-80% of patients undergoing mPB HCT experience at least one severe infection within the first 180 days following HCT. Additionally, approximately 50% of patients undergoing HCT experience cancer relapse or die within the first two years following HCT. We believe our cell programming approach has the potential to reduce the three leading causes of morbidity and mortality associated with allogeneic HCT – namely, graft-versus-host disease, severe infections and disease relapse – and to improve outcomes in patients undergoing allogeneic HCT.
 We are developing ProTmune as an investigational programmed cellular immunotherapy for use as a next-generation allogeneic HCT cell graft. ProTmune is produced by modulating donor-sourced mPB ex vivo with two small molecules, 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (FT1050) and dexamethasone (FT4145), to enhance the biological properties and therapeutic function of the graft’s cells. The programmed mPB graft is administered to a patient as a one-time intravenous therapy. Based on preclinical data, we believe ProTmune has the potential to suppress the GvHD response and maintain the anti-tumor, or graft-versus-leukemia (GvL), activity of donor T cells. We have demonstrated that FT1050-FT4145 programmed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of mPB are functionally less allo-reactive in vitro, exhibiting a decrease both in the expression levels of T-cell activation markers, including ICOS and 41BB, and in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and an increase in the production of potent anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-10.
 We are conducting a multi-center Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ProTmune in adult subjects with hematologic malignancies undergoing mPB HCT following myeloablative conditioning, a clinical trial which we refer to as the PROTECT study. The primary objectives of the PROTECT study are to evaluate safety and tolerability, and to assess the potential of ProTmune to prevent acute GvHD, which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing HCT. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for the prevention of GvHD in patients undergoing allogeneic HCT, giving rise to a significant unmet medical need. All subjects in the PROTECT study are being followed for a period of two years following HCT.
 In December 2018, we reported clinical data from the Phase 1 stage of PROTECT. The Phase 1 stage of PROTECT included seven subjects. Underlying hematologic diseases included three subjects with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), three with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and one with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). As of a November 26, 2018 data cut-off, five of seven subjects remained on study with median time on study of 516 days [Day 151 – 616], and the following key safety and efficacy data were reported:
  
• | ProTmune was well-tolerated. There were no events of graft failure and no serious adverse events related to ProTmune reported by investigators.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | There were no reported events of cancer relapse.
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | At Day 100, all seven subjects receiving ProTmune were alive and relapse-free; and three subjects experienced acute GvHD during the first 100 days following HCT, all of whom responded to standard-of-care steroid treatment. The median time to resolution of the maximum GvHD grade was 7 days [range: 5-8 days].
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | At Day 365, five of seven subjects receiving ProTmune were alive and relapse-free, with non-relapse mortality occurring in two subjects (Subject 1 on Day 228; Subject 3 on Day 151); and three of seven subjects were alive, relapse-free and without moderate-to-severe chronic GvHD.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ongoing Phase 2 stage of PROTECT is a randomized, controlled and double-blinded clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of ProTmune in up to 60 adult subjects with hematologic malignancies undergoing matched unrelated donor HCT following myeloablative conditioning. Subjects are being randomized, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either ProTmune or a conventional matched unrelated donor mobilized peripheral blood cell graft. The primary efficacy endpoint of PROTECT is cumulative incidence of Grades 2-4 acute GvHD by Day 100 following HCT, where prospective clinical studies have shown that 40% to 80% of patients undergoing matched unrelated donor transplant experience Grades 2-4 acute GvHD. Additional endpoints, such as rates of cancer relapse, chronic GvHD, non-relapse mortality, overall survival and overall survival with freedom from cancer relapse and from moderate-to-severe chronic GvHD, are also being assessed. Fifteen U.S. centers are currently open for enrollment in the Phase 2 stage of PROTECT. In December 2018, we reported that over 30 subjects had been treated in the randomized, controlled and double-blinded Phase 2 PROTECT study.
 In June 2016, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for ProTmune for the reduction of incidence and severity of acute GvHD in patients undergoing allogeneic HCT. In September 2016, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation and, in October 2016, the European Commission granted Orphan Medicinal Product Designation, for ProTmune. The orphan designation granted in each jurisdiction broadly covers subjects undergoing allogeneic HCT across diseases for which the procedure is performed, including blood cancers and genetic disorders.
 FT301
 Autoimmune diseases arise from abnormal immune responses in which the body’s immune system attacks and damages its own tissues. Some of the most common autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, type-1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease and asthma. It is estimated that more than 23 million people in the U.S. suffer from autoimmunity, which makes it the third most common category of illness in the U.S. after cancer and heart disease.
 Auto-reactive T lymphocytes are key players in aberrant autoimmune responses. We believe that certain biological mechanisms, which have been demonstrated to suppress T-cell activity against cancer cells, can be exploited to suppress auto-reactive T-cell destruction of normal tissues. For example, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a naturally occurring population of cells that are often found in the tumor microenvironment, where these cells function to inhibit antigen-specific and non-specific T-cell activation and proliferation through a diverse set of mechanisms. While MDSCs can impede T-cell responses against cancer, the cells’ potent immuno-suppressive properties may serve to immunologically check auto-reactive T lymphocytes that are directly responsible for the destruction of healthy tissue in certain autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.
 MDSCs are rare in healthy donors and, although abundant in tumor-bearing patients, repurposing tumor-derived MDSCs for therapeutic use may pose undesirable risks. As a result, a need exists to generate MDSCs in large quantities, particularly from healthy donor sources, in order to explore the therapeutic potential of MDSCs. Using a proprietary, efficient and reproducible differentiation process, we have shown the potential to create a substantially pure population of iPSC-derived MDSCs that is well-defined. Preclinical studies of iPSC-derived MDSCs have shown that the cells suppress T-cell activity and proliferation in vitro and attenuate GvHD in vivo in a xenogeneic mouse model. Importantly, these immuno-regulatory properties were demonstrated using immunologically-mismatched cells.
 We are developing FT301, an off-the-shelf, immuno-regulatory cell product candidate derived from a clonal master iPSC line. We believe FT301 has broad therapeutic potential across multiple disease indications, including graft-versus-host disease, multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis and others.
 Our Cell Programming Partnerships
 Ono Pharmaceutical
 In September 2018, we entered into a collaboration and option agreement with Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Ono) for the joint development and commercialization of two off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived CAR T-cell product candidates. The first off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived CAR T-cell candidate (Candidate 1) targets an antigen expressed on certain lymphoblastic leukemias, and the second off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived CAR T-cell candidate (Candidate 2) targets a novel antigen identified by Ono expressed on certain solid tumors (each a Candidate and, collectively, the
 Candidates). Pursuant to the agreement, we are jointly conducting research and development activities under a joint development plan with Ono, with the goal of advancing each Candidate to a pre-defined preclinical milestone. 
 We have granted to Ono, during a specified period of time, an option to obtain an exclusive license under certain intellectual property rights to develop and commercialize (a) Candidate 1 in Asia, where we retain rights for development and commercialization in all other territories of the world and (b) Candidate 2 in all territories of the world, where we retain rights to co-develop and co-commercialize Candidate 2 in the United States and Europe under a joint arrangement with Ono under which we are eligible to share 
 13


at least 50% of the profits and losses. For each Candidate, the option will expire upon the earliest of: (a) the achievement of the pre-defined preclinical milestone, (b) termination by Ono of research and development activities for the Candidate and (c) the date that is the later of (i) four years after the Effective Date and (ii) completion of all applicable activities contemplated under the joint development plan. We maintain worldwide rights of manufacture for both Candidates.
 Under the terms of the agreement, Ono paid us an upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $10.0 million in connection with entering into the agreement. Additionally, as consideration for our conduct of research and preclinical development under a joint development plan, Ono pays us annual research and development fees set forth in the annual budget included in the joint development plan, which fees are estimated to be $20.0 million in aggregate over the course of the joint development plan. Further, Ono has agreed to pay us up to an additional $40.0 million, subject to the achievement of a preclinical milestone and the exercise by Ono of its options to develop and commercialize Candidate 1 and Candidate 2. Such fees are in addition to the upfront payment and research and development fees. 
 Subject to Ono’s exercise of the options and to the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to each Candidate in specified territories, we are entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $285.0 million in milestone payments for Candidate 1 and an aggregate of up to $895.0 million in milestone payments for Candidate 2, with the applicable milestone payments for Candidate 2 for the United States and Europe subject to reduction by 50% if we elect to co-develop and co-commercialize Candidate 2 as described above. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digits to the low-double digits based on annual net sales by Ono of each Candidate in specified territories, with such royalties subject to certain reductions. 
 The agreement will terminate with respect to a Candidate if Ono does not exercise its option for a Candidate within the option period, or in its entirety if Ono does not exercise any of its options for the Candidates within their respective option periods. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement in the event of breach, insolvency or patent challenges by the other party; provided, that Ono may terminate the agreement in its sole discretion (x) on a Candidate-by-Candidate basis at any time after the second anniversary of the effective date of the agreement or (y) on a Candidate-by-Candidate or country-by-country basis at any time after the expiration of the option period, subject to certain limitations. The agreement will expire on a Candidate-by-Candidate and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the applicable royalty term, or in its entirety upon the expiration of all applicable payment obligations under the agreement.
 Juno Therapeutics
 In May 2015, we entered into a strategic research collaboration and license agreement with Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (Juno) bringing together our expertise in hematopoietic cell biology and cell programming with Juno’s scientific and development leadership in CAR and T-cell receptor (TCR) immunotherapy. Under the collaboration, we screen for and seek to identify small molecule modulators that improve the function of T cells, including for molecules that enhance the therapeutic properties of CAR T-cell and TCR immunotherapies. Juno is responsible for the development and commercialization of genetically engineered CAR T-cell and TCR immunotherapies incorporating our modulators.
 Under the agreement, subject to the selection by Juno of designated tumor-associated antigen targets which selection may be made by Juno on a target-by-target basis, we agreed to grant Juno an exclusive worldwide license to certain of our intellectual property, including our intellectual property arising under the collaboration, to make, use, sell and otherwise exploit genetically-engineered CAR T cell and TCR immunotherapies (excluding those derived from iPSCs) using or incorporating small molecule modulators directed against such designated tumor-associated antigen targets. We have retained exclusive rights to such intellectual property, including our intellectual property arising under the collaboration, for all other purposes.
 Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Juno paid us an upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $5.0 million, and purchased one million shares of our common stock, at $8.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million. Additionally, Juno agreed to fund all of our collaboration research activities during the research term of the agreement with minimum annual research payments of $2.0 million to us. The initial research term of the agreement is four years ending in May 2019. Juno has the option to extend the exclusive research term for an additional two years beyond the initial four-year term, subject to the payment of a one-time, non-refundable extension fee of $3.0 million and the continued funding of our activities under the collaboration during the extended term, with minimum annual research payments of $4.0 million to us during the two-year extension period. Additionally, if Juno elects to exercise its extension option, we then have the option to require Juno to purchase up to $10.0 million of our common stock at a premium equal to 120% of the then thirty-day trailing volume weighted average trading price. Juno may terminate the agreement upon six (6) months’ written notice to us.
 We are eligible under the agreement to receive selection fees for each tumor-associated antigen target selected by Juno and bonus selection fees based on the aggregate number of tumor-associated antigen targets selected by Juno. Additionally, in connection with each Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators, Juno has agreed to pay us non-refundable, non-creditable milestone payments totaling up to approximately $51.0 million, in the aggregate, per therapy upon the achievement of 
 14


various clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. Additionally, in connection with the third Juno therapy and the fifth Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators, Juno has agreed to pay us additional non-refundable, non-creditable bonus milestone payments totaling up to approximately $116.0 million and $137.5 million, respectively, in the aggregate, per therapy upon the achievement of various clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones.
 Beginning on the date of the first commercial sale (in each country) for each Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators, and continuing until the later of i) the expiration of the last valid patent claim, ii) ten years after such first commercial sale, or iii) the expiration of all data and other regulatory exclusivity periods afforded each therapy, Juno has agreed to pay us royalties in the low single-digits on net sales of each Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators.
 During the term of our research activities under the agreement, we have agreed to collaborate exclusively with Juno on the research and development of small molecule modulators with respect to CAR T-cell and TCR immunotherapies (excluding those derived from iPSCs) against certain tumor-associated antigen targets designated by Juno. Furthermore, during the term of the agreement, we will be unable to conduct, or enable third parties to conduct, research, development and commercialization activities using small molecule modulators to enhance the therapeutic properties of CAR T-cell and TCR immunotherapies against certain tumor-associated antigen targets selected by Juno.
 In March 2018, Juno was acquired by Celgene Corporation (Celgene). This acquisition did not affect the terms of the Juno Agreement. On January 3, 2019, Celgene announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), under which BMS will acquire Celgene.  
 Additional iPSC Platform Technologies
 In September 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the J. David Gladstone Institutes (Gladstone) under which we obtained an exclusive license to certain patents and patent applications for the research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of human therapeutics derived from iPSCs (the Gladstone License Agreement). The licensed patent rights cover the generation of iPSCs using CRISPR-mediated gene activation. This new approach for inducing pluripotency uses CRISPR to directly target a specific location of the genome and activate endogenous gene expression, and does not rely on established methods of cellular reprogramming that require the transduction of multiple transcription factors. The discovery was made by a team of scientists led by Sheng Ding, Ph.D., a senior investigator at Gladstone and one of our scientific founders.
 In consideration for the rights granted under the Gladstone License Agreement, we issued to Gladstone 100,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act regarding transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering.
 Additionally, we paid Gladstone an upfront fee of $0.1 million and are obligated to pay Gladstone milestone payments in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $1.9 million upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones and tiered royalties in the low single digits on net sales of licensed products developed using the licensed intellectual property rights. We are also obligated to pay Gladstone a tiered percentage in the low to mid-single digits of certain income received by us in connection with the sublicense of the licensed patent rights.
 Our Intellectual Property
 Overview
 We seek to protect our product candidates and our cell programming technology through a variety of methods, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, our platform technologies and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection and, in addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we typically file counterpart patent applications in additional countries where we believe such foreign filing is likely to be beneficial, including Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and China. We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy in order to best fortify our position, and file additional patent applications when our intellectual property strategy warrants such filings. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We have entered into exclusive license agreements with various academic and research institutions to obtain the rights to use certain patents for the development and commercialization of our product candidates.
 As of March 1, 2019, our intellectual property portfolio is composed of over 200 issued patents and 150 patent applications that we license from academic and research institutions, and over 100 issued patents or pending patent applications that we own. These patents and patent applications generally provide us with the rights to develop our product candidates in the United States and worldwide. This portfolio covers compositions of programmed cellular immunotherapeutics, including ProTmune, our cell programming approach for enhancing the therapeutic function of cells ex vivo, and our platform for industrial-scale iPSC generation 
 15


and engineering. We believe that we have a significant intellectual property position and substantial know-how relating to the programming of hematopoietic and immune cells and to the derivation, genetic engineering, and differentiation of iPSCs.
 We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for additional information on the risks associated with our intellectual property strategy and portfolio.
 Intellectual Property Relating to the Programming of Hematopoietic and Immune Cells
 As of March 1, 2019, we own 12 families of U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications covering our cell programming technology and compositions of programmed cellular immunotherapies. This portfolio includes 70 issued patents or pending patent applications relating to methods of programming the biological properties and therapeutic function of cells ex vivo, and the resulting therapeutic compositions of hematopoietic and immune cells. Patents and patent applications in this portfolio include claims covering (i) therapeutic compositions of hematopoietic and immune cells, including T cells, NK cells, and CD34+ cells, that have been programmed ex vivo with one or more agents to optimize their therapeutic function for application in oncology and immune disorders and (ii) methods of programming cells including by the activation or inhibition of therapeutically-relevant genes and cell-surface proteins, such as those involved in the homing, proliferation and survival of hematopoietic cells or those involved in the persistence, proliferation and reactivity of immune cells. Any U.S. patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue from pending patent applications will have statutory expiration dates between 2030 and 2039.
 Additionally, we have an exclusive license to an intellectual property portfolio consisting of two families of issued patents and pending patent applications co-owned by the Children’s Medical Center Corporation and The General Hospital Corporation. As of March 1, 2019, we currently have exclusive rights to 50 issued patents or patent applications in the United States and worldwide relating to methods for programming hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo using modulators that up-regulate the prostaglandin signaling pathway or its downstream mediators. These patent rights consist of issued patents (including U.S. Patents 8,168,428 and 8,563,310) claiming methods for the ex vivo programming of hematopoietic stem cells using FT1050, including hematopoietic stem cells obtained from mobilized peripheral blood, cord blood, and bone marrow. Pending patent applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions are directed to therapeutic compositions of hematopoietic stem cells in which the cells have been modulated by increasing prostaglandin activity, methods of preparing these compositions, and methods of promoting hematopoietic reconstitution, expansion and self-renewal using modulators that increase prostaglandin signaling activity. Any U.S. patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue will have a statutory expiration date in 2027.
 We have also licensed exclusive rights to two families of issued patents and patent applications from the Indiana University Research and Technology Corporation. This portfolio includes patent applications claiming methods of enhancing HCT procedures by altering prostaglandin activity in hematopoietic stem cells as well as an issued U.S. patent and patent applications claiming methods of enhancing viral transduction efficiency in the genetic engineering of stem cells, including hematopoietic stem cells.

 Manufacturing
 ProTmune™
 ProTmune is a composition of ex vivo programmed human mobilized peripheral blood cells. ProTmune is produced by treating qualified human mobilized peripheral blood with two small molecules, FT1050 and FT4145, in a multi-step process that is performed on the day of HCT. Currently, the manufacture of ProTmune is performed at clinical cell processing facilities operated by or affiliated with our clinical sites. The manufacturing process consists of functionally closed unit operations. We aim to continue to develop manufacturing processes to further standardize the manufacture of ProTmune across clinical cell processing facilities.
 Human peripheral blood cells from a donor, whose tissue type closely matches the patient’s, are used as the starting cellular source material for the manufacture of ProTmune. HCT centers can electronically access a worldwide network of donor registries, which collect and transfer human peripheral blood cells from donors, to source these cells on behalf of patients. We expect donor registries to continue to collect and transfer, and HCT centers to continue to source, human peripheral blood cells for our manufacture of ProTmune. Other components used in the manufacture of ProTmune include programming media as well as disposable materials, such as bags and tubing sets. To date, we have obtained all components required for the manufacture of ProTmune, including FT1050, FT4145 and programming media, from third-party manufacturers and suppliers, which include, in some instances, sole source manufacturers and suppliers. We do not currently have long-term commitments or supply agreements in place to obtain human peripheral blood cells and certain components used in the manufacture of ProTmune.
 For the conduct of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ProTmune, the clinical cell processing facility at each participating site is qualified and trained by our technical staff to manufacture ProTmune. Our technical representative(s) are on-site at the clinical cell processing facility for each of the first two subjects administered ProTmune at a participating site. ProTmune is released immediately by the clinical cell processing facility staff after final processing, including filtration, final packaging, rapid release testing, and labeling. In the future, we may manufacture ProTmune at facilities operated by us, by transplant centers, or by third parties.
 FATE-NK100
 FATE-NK100 is a first-in-class NK cell cancer immunotherapy comprised of adaptive memory NK cells. The cell therapy product candidate is manufactured using peripheral blood (PB) leukocytes from a CMV seropositive donor, where the donor is typically a HLA haplo-identical donor, and is depleted of CD3+ (T-lymphocytes) and CD19+ (B-lymphocytes). This starting cell population is cultured for seven days in a feeder-free environment and in a media containing a proprietary pharmacologic modulator combination, including a cytokine and a small molecule GSK3β inhibitor, to expand and enrich for NK cells that phenotypically have been associated with the adaptive memory phenotype.
 For the conduct of Phase 1 clinical trials, FATE-NK100 is manufactured at each participating clinical site by a clinical cell processing facility operated by or affiliated with such clinical site. Each clinical cell processing facility is trained and qualified to manufacture FATE-NK100 by our technical staff prior to manufacture of FATE-NK100 for clinical use. We may in the future qualify additional medical center cell therapy facilities, contract with third-party manufacturers, or operate our own facilities for the manufacture of FATE-NK100 for use in clinical trials or for commercial therapeutic use.   
 Other reagents and excipients used in the manufacture of FATE-NK100 include the pharmacologic modulators used in programming FATE-NK100 as well as the culture media used in the seven-day manufacturing process. All of these reagents and excipients required for the manufacture of FATE-NK100 are obtained today from third-party manufacturers and suppliers. We do not currently have long-term commitments or supply agreements in place to obtain these components used in the manufacture of FATE-NK100.

Off-the-Shelf Cellular Immunotherapies Created from Master Pluripotent Cell Lines
 The manufacture of our off-the-shelf cellular immunotherapy product candidates created from iPSCs involves a three-stage process:
  
• | The first stage is intended to generate a clonal master iPSC line and generally consists of the following steps: (i) obtain appropriately-consented normal human donor cells, such as fibroblasts or hematopoietic cells, and conduct transfusion transmissible disease testing on the donor cells; (ii) induction of pluripotency in the donor cells using a proprietary transgene integration-free and footprint-free method of reprogramming; (iii) genetic engineering, where applicable, of iPSCs; (iv) isolation and selection of a single iPSC, followed by clonal expansion of the single iPSC to produce a clonal master iPSC line for cell product candidate manufacture.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The second stage is intended to derive the cell product population of interest and generally consists of the following steps: (i) expansion and differentiation of the clonal master iPSC line to produce CD34+ definitive hematopoietic progenitor cells; and (ii) further expansion and differentiation of these progenitor cells to produce the cell product population of interest.

• | The third stage is intended to derive the final cell product candidate and generally consists of the following steps: (i) washing the cell product population; (ii) formulating the cell product population in an infusion media for intravenous administration of the final cell product candidate; and (iii) cryopreserving individual aliquots of the final cell product candidate and storing these aliquots in single-dose infusion bags.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are manufacturing our iPSC-derived cell product candidates for use in research and preclinical development, and manufacturing certain elements used to produce clinical supplies of our product candidates.  Currently, we contract with third parties, including medical center cell therapy facilities and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), for the conduct of some or all of the activities required for manufacturing our iPSC-derived cell product candidates for use in clinical investigation. We expect that we will continue to contract with third parties, including medical center cell therapy facilities and CMOs, for the conduct of some or all of the activities required for manufacturing our iPSC-derived cell product candidates.  Additionally, we have initiated build out of our own GMP manufacturing facility, and plan to continue investing in our manufacturing capabilities and technology.  In the future we may manufacture our iPSC-derived cell product candidates for clinical or commercial supply at facilities we own or operate.
 As part of our manufacturing process, we endeavor to utilize cGMP grade materials and reagents, if commercially available; however, certain critical materials and reagents are currently qualified for research use only. Additionally, we obtain key components required for the manufacture of our iPSC-derived cell product candidates from third-party manufacturers and suppliers, which include, in some instances, sole source manufacturers and suppliers. We do not currently have long-term commitments or supply agreements in place to obtain certain key components used in the manufacture of our iPSC-derived cell product candidates. 
 Marketing & Sales
 We currently intend to commercialize any products that we may successfully develop. We currently have no experience in marketing or selling therapeutic products. To market any of our products independently would require us to develop a sales force with technical expertise along with establishing commercial infrastructure and capabilities. Our commercial strategy for marketing our product candidates also may include the use of strategic partners, distributors, a contract sales force or the establishment of our own commercial infrastructure. We plan to further evaluate these alternatives as we approach approval for the first of our product candidates.
Government Regulation
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA) and the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act) and related regulations, and drugs under the FDCA and related regulations. Biological products and drugs are also subject to other federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of biological products and drugs. These agencies and other federal, state, local, and foreign entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, reporting, approval or licensing, advertising and promotion, and import and export of our products. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions include refusal to approve pending applications, suspension or revocation of an approval or license, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. In addition, government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities.

Marketing Approval
 The process required by the FDA before biological products and drugs may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of nonclinical laboratory and animal tests according to good laboratory practices (GLPs) and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices (GCPs) and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product or drug for its intended use or uses;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | for a biological product, submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials, and, for a drug, submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) that includes substantive evidence of the product’s safety and efficacy;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMPs to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate, and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices (cGTPs) for the use of human cellular and tissue products to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study sites and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA or NDA; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA and review and approval of the NDA which must occur before a biological product and a drug can be marketed or sold.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

U.S. Biological Products and Drug Development Process
 Before testing any biological product or drug candidate in humans, nonclinical tests, including laboratory evaluations and animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate, are conducted. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
 Prior to commencing the first clinical trial, the trial sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of an initial IND application. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND application is submitted. The IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such case, the sponsor of the IND application must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. The FDA also may impose a clinical hold on ongoing clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If a clinical hold is imposed, a trial may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Further, an independent institutional review board (IRB) for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that site. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study subjects and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA and to the IRB. Information about certain clinical studies must be submitted with specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
 For purposes of BLA or NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap:
  
• | Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. These trials may also provide early evidence on effectiveness.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 22


 
• | Phase 2—These trials are conducted in a limited number of patients in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—Phase 3 trials are undertaken to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further evaluate dosage, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the product has been obtained, and are intended to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval and are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA has statutory authority to require post-market clinical trials to address safety issues. All of these trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements in order for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes.
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting, written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events; any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
 Regulatory authorities, a data safety monitoring board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the investigated product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients, and the trial may not recommence without the IRB’s authorization.
 Typically, if a product is intended to treat a chronic disease, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time, which can range from six months to three years or more.
 Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the investigational product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with the use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 A drug being studied in clinical trials may be made available to individual patients in certain circumstances. Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act (the Cures Act), as amended, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the earlier of the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug, or as applicable, 15 days after the drug receives a designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative advanced therapy.
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 In order to obtain approval to market a biological product in the United States, a BLA must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety, purity and potency of the investigational product for the proposed indication. Similarly, for a drug, an NDA must be submitted to the FDA that provides data demonstrating the drug is safe and effective. Both a BLA and an NDA include all data available from nonclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s manufacture and composition, and proposed labeling.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as amended, each BLA and NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective beginning on October 1, 2018 the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as a BLA and an NDA, will be $2,588,478 for fiscal year 2019. PDUFA 
 23


also imposes an annual prescription drug product program fee for biologics and drugs ($309,915 for fiscal year 2019). Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs or NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA or NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA or NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA or NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. After the BLA or NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA or NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMPs to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency, and purity, and for a biological product, whether it meets the biological product standards. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically comprised of clinicians and other experts, for evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a human cellular or tissue product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with cGTPs. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products (HCT/Ps) with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA may inspect clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCPs. If the FDA determines the manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will require the facility to take corrective action and provide documentation evidencing the implementation of such corrective action, which may delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCPs, the FDA may determine the data generated by the site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the BLA or NDA, and request additional testing or data. Additionally, the FDA ultimately may still decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 The FDA also has authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a biological product or drug outweigh its risks. A sponsor may also voluntarily propose a REMS as part of the BLA or NDA submission. The need for a REMS is determined as part of the review of the BLA or NDA. Based on statutory standards, elements of a REMS may include “dear doctor letters,” a medication guide, more elaborate targeted educational programs, and in some cases restrictions on distribution. These elements are negotiated as part of the BLA or NDA approval, and in some cases may delay the approval date. Once adopted, REMS are subject to periodic assessment and modification.
 After the FDA completes its initial review of a BLA or NDA, it will communicate to the sponsor that the biological product will either be approved, or it will issue a complete response letter to communicate that the BLA or NDA will not be approved in its current form. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA or NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the applicant in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA or NDA to address all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application, or request a hearing.
 One of the performance goals of the FDA under PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs and NDAs in 10 months and 90% of priority BLAs and NDAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and NDAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal data may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA or NDA applicant otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
 Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing clinical trials and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in the imposition of new restrictions on the product or complete withdrawal of the product from the market.

Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has a Fast Track program intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new drugs and biological products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition or disease and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a biological product or drug may request the FDA to designate the biologic or drug as a Fast Track product at any time during clinical development. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a biological product or drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a biological product or drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials. 
 The FDCA also requires FDA to expedite the development and review of a breakthrough therapy. A biological product or drug can be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A sponsor may request that a biological product or drug be designated as a breakthrough therapy at any time during the clinical development of the product. If so designated, FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product’s marketing application, including by meeting with, and providing advice to, the sponsor throughout the product’s development, and taking steps to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable.
 Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 Accelerated Approval for Regenerative Advanced Therapies 
 As part of the Cures Act, Congress amended the FDCA to create an accelerated approval program for regenerative advanced therapies, which include cell therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products.  Regenerative advanced therapies do not include those human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products regulated solely under section 361 of the PHS Act and 21 CFR Part 1271.  The new program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of regenerative advanced therapies, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition.  A drug sponsor may request that FDA designate a drug as a regenerative advanced therapy concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND.  FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition.  A BLA or NDA for a regenerative advanced therapy may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through (1) surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit or (2) reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites.  Benefits of such designation also include early interactions with FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval.  A regenerative advanced therapy that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Under certain circumstances, U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Patent term restoration can compensate for time lost during product development and the regulatory review process by returning up to five years of patent life for 
 25


a patent that covers a new product or its use. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The period of patent term restoration is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND application (falling after issuance of the patent) and the submission date of a BLA or NDA, plus the time between the submission date of the BLA or NDA and the approval of that application, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The application for patent term extension is subject to approval by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in consultation with the FDA. A patent term extension is only available when the FDA approves a biological product or drug for the first time.
 With the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the FDCA. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit to the agency an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) which relies on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug (RLD). For the ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. The FDA must also determine that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the innovator drug.
 An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, a FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, which was part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA). This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product is biosimilar to the reference biological product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the product and the reference product may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product.
 A reference biological product is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biological product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologic’s patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
 A biological product or drug can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
 Orphan Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to biological products and drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a biological product or drug in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA or NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the applicant, the name of the therapeutic agent and its designated orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a biological product or drug that receives orphan designation is the first such product approved by FDA for the orphan indication, it receives orphan product exclusivity, which for seven years prohibits the FDA from approving another application to market the same product for the same indication. Orphan product exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if the new product is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety or a demonstration that the new product otherwise makes a major contribution to patient care. More than one product may also be approved by the FDA for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products are different. If a biological product or drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits.
 Pediatric Research Equity Act
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), as amended, a BLA or NDA or supplement must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product or drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The intent of PREA is 
 26


to compel sponsors whose products have pediatric applicability to study those products in pediatric populations. The FDCA requires manufacturers of biological products and drugs that include a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration to submit a pediatric study plan to the FDA as part of the IND application. The plan must be submitted not later than 60 days after the end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA; or if there is no such meeting, before the initiation of any Phase 3 trials or a combined Phase 2 and Phase 3 trial; or if no such trial will be conducted, no later than 210 days before submitting a marketing application or supplement. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. By its terms, PREA does not apply to any biological product or drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted, unless the FDA issues regulations stating otherwise. Because the FDA has not issued any such regulations, submission of a pediatric assessment is not required for an application to market a product for an orphan-designated indication.
 Other Regulations
 We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid innovation, intense and dynamic competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, scientific knowledge and experience in the field of cellular immunotherapy provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, as well as standard-of-care treatments, new products undergoing development and combinations of existing and new therapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies, including combinations thereof, that may become available in the future.
 We are developing ProTmune as a next-generation mobilized peripheral blood graft for patients undergoing allogeneic HCT. The product candidate is intended to prevent GvHD and other life-threatening complications that compromise the procedure’s curative potential. While ProTmune is designed to replace a standard-of-care mobilized peripheral blood graft to improve patient outcomes, we are aware of other companies and medical centers that are developing adjunct therapies, such as Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Kiadis Pharma Netherlands B.V., or treatments for GvHD and other life-threatening complications of HCT, such as AbbVie Inc., Incyte Corporation, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 We are developing FATE-NK100 and our off-the-shelf NK- and T-cell product candidates, including FT500 and FT516, as cancer immunotherapies. Cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer have recently been an area of significant research and development by academic institutions and biopharmaceutical companies. While we believe our focus on NK cells, as well as our use of master pluripotent cell lines to create our product candidates, is highly differentiated, a number of companies are currently focused on the development of cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, including Adaptimmune Limited, Allogene Therapeutics, Inc., Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc., bluebird bio, Inc., Celgene Corporation (pending acquisition by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company), Cellectis SA, Celyad SA, CRISPR Therapeutics AG, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Green Cross Corporation, Intrexon Corporation, Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (acquired by Celgene Corporation), Kite Pharma, Inc. (acquired by Gilead Sciences, Inc.), NantKwest, Inc., Novartis AG, Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. and ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc.. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.  
 We compete against our competitors in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and subject enrollment for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. 
 We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.

Insurance
 We maintain product liability insurance for our clinical trials. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if marketing approval is obtained for products in development. However, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. In addition, we may not be able to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed 104 employees, all of whom are full-time employees, including 57 in research and development, 33 in clinical development and regulatory affairs and 14 in general and administrative.
