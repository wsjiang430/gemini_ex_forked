ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Unisys Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Unisys,” “we,” “our,” or the “company”), is a global information technology (“IT”) company that builds high-performance, security-centric solutions for clients across the Government, Financial Services and Commercial markets. Unisys offerings include security software and services; digital transformation and workplace services; industry applications and services; and innovative software operating environments for high-intensity enterprise computing. 
We operate in two business segments – Services and Technology. 
Principal Products and Services
We deliver high-performance, security-centric, leveraged services across industries, industry-specific application products and technology solutions worldwide to our primary target markets: Government (the U.S. federal government and other public sector organizations around the world), Commercial (e.g., travel and transportation and life sciences and healthcare) and Financial Services (e.g., commercial and retail banking). 
Our solutions are designed to build better outcomes - securely - for our clients, enabling them to:

• | Enhance enterprise security;


• | Transform core business processes to compete more effectively in their markets;


• | Improve user engagement for customers and workers, streamline operations and enhance go-to-market efforts;


• | Optimize IT infrastructure to meet digital-business requirements; and


• | Simplify management of IT infrastructure and service delivery.

Within Services, our principal solutions include cloud and infrastructure services, application services and business process outsourcing services, each of which is delivered with advanced security built in.

• | In cloud and infrastructure services, we help clients apply cloud and as-a-service delivery models to capitalize on business opportunities, make their end users more productive and manage and secure their IT infrastructure and operations more economically.


• | In application services, we help clients transform their business processes by developing and managing new leading-edge applications for select industries, offering advanced data analytics and modernizing existing enterprise applications.


• | In business process outsourcing services, we assume management of critical processes and functions for clients in target industries, helping them improve performance and reduce costs.

In Technology, we design and develop software and offer hardware and other related products to help clients improve security and flexibility, reduce costs and improve the efficiency of their data-center environments. As a pioneer in large-scale computing, we offer deep experience and rich technological capabilities in transaction-intensive, mission-critical operating environments. We provide a range of data-center, infrastructure management and cloud computing offerings to help clients virtualize and automate their data-center environments. 
Our Technology products include:

• | Unisys ClearPath Forward®, a secure, scalable software operating environment for high-intensity enterprise computing capable of delivering Unisys security across multiple platforms. The ClearPath Forward operating environment is hardware-independent and provides a tested, integrated stack of software products that run on a range of contemporary, commonly-deployed Intel x86 server platforms and select virtualization environments of the client’s choice.


• | Unisys Stealth® security software, which enables trusted identities to access micro-segmented critical assets and safely communicate through secure, encrypted channels. Stealth™ establishes irrefutable user authentication, prevents lateral attacker movement and reduces data center, mobile and cloud attack surfaces. Stealth also reduces the cost and complexity of securing information and operation technology such as industrial control systems, allowing organizations to meet compliance and security mandates.

Our industry application products include solutions that securely help law enforcement agencies solve crime and social services case workers assist families; travel and transportation companies manage freight and distribution; life sciences and healthcare companies manage medical devices; and financial institutions deliver omnichannel banking.
We market our security-centric solutions primarily through a direct sales force. Complementing our direct sales force, we make use of a select group of resellers and alliance partners to market our services and product portfolio. In certain foreign countries, we market primarily through distributors. 
Materials
Unisys purchases components and supplies from a number of suppliers around the world. For certain Technology products, we rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, although we make every effort to assure that alternative sources are available if the need arises. The failure of our suppliers to deliver components and supplies in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect our business. For more information on the risks associated with purchasing components and supplies, see “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
As of January 31, 2019, Unisys owns over 615 active U.S. patents and over 50 active patents granted in twelve non-U.S. jurisdictions. These patents cover systems and methods related to a wide variety of technologies, including, but not limited to, information security, cloud computing, virtualization, database encryption/management and user interfaces. We have granted licenses covering both single patents, and particular groups of patents, to others. Likewise, we have active licensing agreements granting us rights under patents owned by other entities. However, our business is not materially dependent upon any single patent, patent license, or related group thereof.
Unisys also maintains 28 U.S. trademark and service mark registrations, and over 540 additional trademark and service mark registrations in over 80 non-U.S. jurisdictions as of January 31, 2019. These marks are valuable assets used on or in connection with our services and products, and as such are actively monitored, policed and protected by Unisys and its agents.
Seasonality
Our revenue is affected by such factors as the introduction of new services and products, the length of sales cycles and the seasonality of purchases. Seasonality has generally resulted in higher fourth quarter revenues than in other quarters.
Customers
No single client accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2018. Sales of commercial services and products to various agencies of the U.S. government represented approximately 20% of total consolidated revenue in 2018. For more information on the risks associated with contracting with governmental entities, see “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).
Backlog
In the Services segment, firm order backlog at December 31, 2018 was $4.8 billion, compared to $4.3 billion at December 31, 2017. Approximately $1.9 billion (40%) of 2018 backlog is expected to be converted to revenue in 2019. Although we believe that this backlog is firm, we may, for commercial reasons, allow the orders to be cancelled, with or without penalty. In addition, funded government contracts included in this backlog are generally subject to termination, in whole or part, at the convenience of the government or if funding becomes unavailable. In such cases, we are generally entitled to receive payment for work completed plus allowable termination or cancellation costs.
Because of the relatively short cycle between order and shipment in our Technology segment, we believe that backlog information for this segment is not material to the understanding of our business.
Competition
Our business is affected by rapid change in technology in the information services and technology industries and aggressive competition from many domestic and foreign companies. Principal competitors are systems integrators, consulting and other professional services firms, outsourcing providers, infrastructure services providers, computer hardware manufacturers and software providers. We compete primarily on the basis of service, product performance, technological innovation, and price. We believe that our continued focused investment in engineering and research and development, coupled with our sales and marketing capabilities, will have a favorable impact on our competitive position. For more information on the competitive risks we face, see “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).

Environmental Matters
Our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position have not been materially affected by compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the protection of the environment. Capital expenditures for environmental control facilities are not expected to be material in 2019 and 2020.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 22,000 employees serving clients around the world.
