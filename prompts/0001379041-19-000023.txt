Property and Casualty Insurance in General
A widely-used measure of relative underwriting performance for an insurance company is the combined ratio. Combined ratio is calculated by adding: (i) the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expense (LAE) to earned premiums (known as the “loss and LAE ratio”); (ii) the ratio of commission expenses to earned premiums (known as the “commission expense ratio”); and (iii) the ratio of underwriting and other operating expenses to earned premiums (known as the “underwriting and operating expenses ratio”), with each component determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A combined ratio under 100% indicates that an insurance company is generating an underwriting profit. A combined ratio over 100% indicates that an insurance company is generating an underwriting loss.
In insurance and reinsurance operations, “float” arises when premiums are received before losses and other expenses are paid, an interval that may extend over many years. During that time, the insurer has the opportunity to invest the money, thereby earning investment income and generating investment gains and losses.
Insurance companies operating at a GAAP combined ratio of greater than 100% can be profitable when investment income and net investment gains are taken into account. The length of time between receiving premiums and paying out losses and other expenses, commonly referred to as the “tail,” can significantly affect how profitable float can be. Long-tail losses, such as workers’ compensation, pay out over longer periods of time providing us the opportunity to generate significant investment earnings from float.
Underwriting income or loss is determined by deducting losses and LAE, commission expenses, and underwriting and other operating expenses from net premiums earned.
Our Strategy
Business Strategy
Our strategy is to pursue profitable growth opportunities across market cycles and maximize total investment returns within the constraints of prudent portfolio management. We pursue profitable growth opportunities by focusing on disciplined underwriting and claims management, utilizing medical provider networks designed to produce superior medical and indemnity outcomes, establishing and maintaining strong, long-term relationships with independent insurance agencies, development and implementation of new technologies designed to transform the way small businesses and insurance agents utilize digital capabilities and developing important alternative distribution channels. We continue to execute a number of ongoing business initiatives, including: focusing on internal and customer-facing business process excellence; offering quotes and insurance coverage directly to customers through a desktop and mobile-friendly platform; accelerating the settlement of open claims; diversifying our risk exposure across geographic markets; utilizing a multi-company pricing platform; utilizing territory-specific pricing; development 
4

and implementation of new technologies to transform the way insurance agents utilize digital capabilities; and leveraging data-driven strategies to target, price, and underwrite profitable classes of business across all of our markets.
Capital Strategy
We believe that we have a strong capital position. We periodically reassess our capital needs to ensure an optimal use of capital consistent with our goal to create shareholder value over the long-term. Our capital strategy is focused on supporting our business operations by maintaining capital levels commensurate with our desired ratings from independent rating agencies, satisfying regulatory constraints and legal requirements, and sustaining a level of financial flexibility to prudently manage our business through insurance and economic cycles while allowing us to take advantage of investment opportunities, including acquisitions of insurance and insurance-related entities, as and when they arise.
We also believe in returning capital not needed for these purposes to our stockholders through regular quarterly dividends and, when feasible, common stock repurchases. During each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we paid dividends on our common stock of $26.7 million, $19.7 million, and $11.5 million, respectively, and during the three-year period ending December 31, 2018, we repurchased $25.7 million of our common stock. Any future returns of capital to our stockholders are dependent on a variety of factors, including our financial position, holding company liquidity, share price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other market and economic conditions.
Description of Business
We are a specialty provider of workers' compensation insurance focused on select small businesses in low to medium hazard industries. We employ a disciplined, conservative underwriting approach designed to individually select specific types of businesses, predominantly those in the lowest four of the seven workers' compensation insurance industry-defined hazard groups, that we believe will have fewer and less costly claims relative to other businesses in the same hazard groups. Workers' compensation is provided under a statutory system wherein most employers are required to provide coverage for their employees' medical, disability, vocational rehabilitation, and/or death benefit costs for work-related injuries or illnesses. We operate as a single reportable segment and conduct operations in 44 states and the District of Columbia (D.C.), with a concentration in California, where over one-half of our business is generated.
In 1999, the Nevada State Industrial Insurance System (the Fund) entered into a retroactive 100% quota share reinsurance agreement (LPT Agreement) through a loss portfolio transfer transaction with third party reinsurers. The LPT Agreement commenced on June 30, 1999 and will remain in effect until all claims under the covered policies have closed, the LPT Agreement is commuted or terminated, upon the mutual agreement of the parties, or the reinsurers' aggregate maximum limit of liability is exhausted, whichever occurs first. The LPT Agreement does not provide for any additional termination terms. On January 1, 2000, we assumed all of the assets, liabilities and operations of the Fund, including the Fund's rights and obligations associated with the LPT Agreement.
We account for the LPT Agreement as retroactive reinsurance. Upon entry into the LPT Agreement, an initial deferred reinsurance gain (Deferred Gain) was recorded as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We are entitled to receive a contingent profit commission under the LPT Agreement. The contingent profit commission is estimated based on both actual paid results to date and projections of expected paid losses under the LPT Agreement.
We had total assets of $3.9 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The following table highlights key results of our operations for the last three years.

 | Years Ended December 31, 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
 | (in millions, except ratios)
Net premiums written | $ | 742.8 | | | $ | 723.7 | | | $ | 694.6
Total revenues | 800.4 | | | 801.4 | | | 779.8 | 
Net income | 141.3 | | | 101.2 | | | 106.7 | 
Combined ratio | 86.1 | % | | 90.5 | % | | 91.8 | %
Impact of the LPT Agreement(1) | 2.0 | % | | 1.6 | % | | 2.3 | %
Combined ratio before the impact of the LPT Agreement(1) | 88.1 | % | | 92.1 | % | | 94.1 | %


(1) | The impact of the LPT Agreement includes: (a) amortization of the Deferred Gain; (b) adjustments to LPT Agreement ceded reserves; and (c) adjustments to Contingent commission receivable–LPT Agreement. The Deferred Gain reflects the unamortized gain from our LPT Agreement. Under GAAP, this gain is deferred and is being amortized using the recovery method. Amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries over the life of the LPT Agreement, except for the contingent profit commission, which is amortized through June 30, 2024. The amortization is reflected in losses and LAE. We periodically reevaluate the remaining direct reserves subject to the LPT Agreement and the expected losses and LAE subject to the contingent profit commission under the LPT Agreement. Our reevaluation results in corresponding adjustments, if needed, to loss reserves, ceded loss reserves, contingent commission receivable, and the Deferred Gain, with the net effect being an increase or decrease to our net income. Combined ratio before

impact of the LPT Agreement is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, but rather reflects the difference in accounting treatment between statutory accounting principles and GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to the combined ratio or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP.
Our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the following states:

Employers Insurance Company of Nevada (EICN) | Nevada 
Employers Compensation Insurance Company (ECIC) | California 
Employers Preferred Insurance Company (EPIC) | Florida 
Employers Assurance Company (EAC) | Florida 

Products and Services 
Workers' compensation provides insurance coverage for the statutorily prescribed benefits that employers are required to provide to their employees who may be injured or suffer illness in the course of employment. The level of benefits varies by state, the nature and severity of the injury or disease, and the wages of the injured worker. Each state has a statutory, regulatory, and adjudicatory system that sets the amount of wage replacement to be paid, determines the level of medical care required to be provided, establishes the degree of permanent impairment, and specifies the options in selecting healthcare providers. These state laws generally require two types of benefits for injured employees: (a) medical benefits, including expenses related to the diagnosis and treatment of an injury, disease, or both, as well as any required rehabilitation, and (b) indemnity payments, which consist of temporary wage replacement, permanent disability payments, and death benefits to surviving family members.
Disciplined Underwriting
Our strategy is to focus on disciplined underwriting and continue to pursue profitable growth opportunities across market cycles. We carefully monitor market trends to assess business opportunities that we expect will meet our pricing and risk standards. We price our policies based on the specific risks associated with each potential insured rather than solely on the industry class in which a potential insured is classified. Our disciplined underwriting approach, workers' compensation specialization, expertise in underwriting small businesses, and data-driven strategies are critical elements of our culture, which we believe allow us to offer competitive prices, diversify our risks, and out-perform the industry.
We execute our underwriting processes through automated systems and experienced underwriters with specific knowledge of the local markets in which we operate. We have developed automated underwriting templates for specific classes of business that produce faster quotes when certain underwriting criteria are met. Our underwriting guidelines consider many factors, such as type of business, nature of operations, and risk exposures, and are designed to minimize or prevent underwriting of certain classes of business that we view as being unattractive.
Loss Control
Our loss control professionals provide consultation to policyholders, as a component of our workers' compensation insurance product, to assist them in preventing or reducing the frequency and severity of losses and containing costs once claims occur. They also assist our underwriting personnel by conducting risk evaluations of potential and current policyholders and are an important part of our underwriting discipline.
Premium Audit
We conduct premium audits on all of our policyholders annually upon the policy expiration or termination. Premium audits allow us to comply with applicable state and reporting bureau requirements and to verify that policyholders have accurately reported their payroll and employee job classifications. We also selectively perform audit reviews and/or update renewal payroll on policies in certain classes of business or if unusual claims are filed or concerns are raised regarding projected annual payrolls, which could result in substantial variances at final audit. These variances result in adjustments to our written and earned premiums, as well as our net losses and LAE, in the periods in which they become known.
Claims and Medical Case Management
The role of our claims department is to actively and efficiently investigate, evaluate, and pay claims, and to aid injured workers in returning to work in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. We have implemented rigorous claims guidelines and control procedures in our claims units and have claims operations throughout the markets we serve. We also provide medical case management services for those claims that we determine will benefit from such involvement.
We utilize an outcome-based medical network that incorporates predictive analytics to identify medical providers who achieve superior clinical outcomes for our injured workers that allows us to optimize our provider network and enhance the quality of care. We have also implemented a proactive pharmacy benefit management program that, along with our outcome-based medical 
6

network, focuses on reducing claims costs and accelerating injured workers' return to work. We have an Injured Employee Hotline that allows employees who are injured at work to receive professional nurse consultation by phone when reporting the claim. This service has proven to reduce overall claims costs and is intended to ensure the injured worker receives appropriate and timely medical care.
In addition to our medical networks, we work closely with local vendors, including attorneys, medical professionals, pharmacy benefits managers, and investigators, to bring local expertise to our reported claims. We pay special attention to reducing costs and have established discounting arrangements with the aforementioned service providers. We use preferred provider organizations, bill review services, and utilization management to closely monitor medical costs. We actively pursue fraud and subrogation recoveries to mitigate claims costs. Subrogation rights are based upon state and federal laws, as well as the insurance policies we issue. Our fraud and subrogation efforts are handled through dedicated units.
We implemented a claim triage predictive model nationally that provides us with early identification of those claims likely to develop into large losses. Leveraging this information, we ensure the right resources and strategies are brought to bear on those claims early in the process.
Our claims department also provides claims management services for those claims incurred by the Fund, which were assumed by EICN and are subject to the LPT Agreement with dates of injury prior to July 1, 1995. Additional information regarding the LPT Agreement is set forth under “–Reinsurance–LPT Agreement.” We receive a management fee from the third party reinsurers equal to 7% of the loss payments on these claims.
Information Technology
Core Operating Systems
We have an efficient, cost-effective and scalable infrastructure that complements our geographic reach and business model. We continue to invest in technology to automate business processes and advanced data and analytics capabilities that will enable us to lower our expense ratios while growing premiums over the long-term and set a foundation for our future needs. Our technology saves our independent agents, brokers, and policyholders considerable time and maintains our competitiveness in our target markets.
Development and Implementation of New Technologies and Capabilities
We have recently initiated a plan of aggressive development and implementation of new technologies and capabilities that are designed to help transform the way small businesses and insurance agents utilize digital capabilities to improve their customer experience. We have chosen to reinvest the expected financial benefits from corporate income tax reform back into our business over the next several years by greatly accelerating the development and deployment of these new digital capabilities. We believe that these new technological and intellectual capabilities will support our future growth initiatives, provide direct access to workers' compensation insurance to those customers seeking an online experience, provide us with greater pricing precision and flexibility, and promote long-term value creation. 
The development and implementation of these new technologies and capabilities increased our underwriting and other operating expense ratio in 2018 and we expect that they will continue to increase our underwriting and other operating expense ratio in 2019 and 2020, as compared to that experienced in prior years. However, in future periods we expect that these additional expenses will, over time, be more than offset by anticipated new premium writings and operational efficiency gains.
Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery
We maintain business continuity and disaster recovery plans for our critical business functions, including the restoration of information technology infrastructure and applications. We utilize two data centers that act as production facilities and as disaster recovery sites for each other. In addition, we utilize an off-site data storage facility for critical customer and systems data. 
Cyber Security
Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information. Our business, including our ability to adequately price products and services, establish reserves, provide an effective and secure service to our customers and report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner, depends significantly on the integrity, availability and timeliness of the data we maintain, as well as the data held by third parties, service providers and systems.
In an effort to ensure the privacy, confidentiality and integrity of this data, we are continually enhancing our cyber and other information security in order to remain secure against emerging threats, as well as increasing our ability to detect, and recover from, a cyber-attack or unauthorized access.

Customers and Workers' Compensation Premiums
The workers' compensation insurance industry classifies risks into seven hazard groups, as defined by the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI), based on severity of claims, with businesses in the first or lowest group having the lowest claims costs.
We target select small businesses engaged in low to medium hazard industries. Our historical loss experience has been more favorable for lower industry-defined hazard groups than for higher hazard groups. Further, we believe it is generally less costly to service and manage the risks associated with these lower hazard groups. Our underwriters use their local market expertise and disciplined underwriting to select specific types of businesses and risks within the classes of business we underwrite that allow us to generate loss ratios that are better than the industry average.
We focus heavily on in-force premiums, which represent the estimated annual premium on all policies that have not expired or have not been canceled. The following table shows a reconciliation of our gross premiums earned during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 to in-force premiums as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016

We currently write business in 44 states and D.C. Our business is concentrated in California, which makes the results of our operations more dependent on the trends that are unique to that state and that may differ from national trends. State and federal legislation and regulation, court decisions, local competition, economic and employment trends, and workers' compensation medical cost trends can materially impact our financial results.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our policyholders had average annual in-force premiums of $7,281 and $7,333, respectively. We are not dependent on any single policyholder and the loss of any single policyholder would not have a material adverse effect on our business.
The following table shows our in-force premiums and number of policies in-force for each state with at least five percent of our in-force premiums and all other states combined as of December 31:

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016

Total | $ | 666.2 | | | 91,498 | | $ | 626.9 | | | 85,494 | | $ | 618.6 | 84,822

From 2016 through 2018, our total in-force premiums and number of policies in-force increased 7.7% and 7.9%, respectively. During the same period, our in-force premiums in California increased 2.5%, while policy count in California decreased 0.3%, reflecting our efforts to continue to diversify and grow our business in new and profitable markets. We cannot be certain how these trends will ultimately impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
Our premiums are generally a function of the applicable premium rate, the amount of the insured's payroll, and if applicable, a factor reflecting the insured's historical loss experience (experience modification factor). Premium rates vary by state according to the nature of the employees' duties and the business of the employer. The premium is computed by applying the applicable premium rate to each class of the insured's payroll after it has been appropriately classified. Total policy premium is determined after applying an experience modification factor and a further adjustment, known as a schedule rating adjustment, and other adjustments, which may be made in certain circumstances, to increase or decrease the policy premium. Schedule rating adjustments are made based on individual risk characteristics of the insured and subject to maximum amounts as established in our premium rate filings.
Our premium rates are based upon actuarial analyses for each state in which we do business, except in “administered pricing” states, primarily Florida, Wisconsin, and Idaho, where premium rates are set by state insurance regulators.
Pricing on our renewals showed an overall price decrease of 11.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018, versus the rate level in effect on such business a year earlier. We believe that we can continue to write attractive business due to favorable loss costs and frequency trends and the success of our accelerated claims initiatives, despite the competitive market conditions we currently face. Given the strength of our balance sheet, the execution of our underwriting, claims, and investment strategies, we believe that we are well positioned for the current market cycle.
Losses and LAE Reserves and Loss Development
We are directly liable for losses and LAE under the terms of the insurance policies our insurance subsidiaries write. Significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us, and our payment of that loss. Loss reserves are reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets under the line item caption “Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.” Estimating reserves is a complex process that involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and is inherently uncertain. Loss reserve estimates represent a significant risk to our business, which we attempt to mitigate by frequently and routinely reviewing loss cost trends.
For a detailed description of our reserves, the judgments, key assumptions and actuarial methodologies that we use to estimate our reserves, and the role of our consulting actuary, see “Item 7 –Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations –Critical Accounting Policies –Reserves for Losses and LAE” and Note 9 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Reinsurance
Reinsurance is a transaction between insurance companies in which an original insurer, or ceding company, remits a portion of its premiums to a reinsurer, or assuming company, as payment for the reinsurer assuming a portion of the risk. Excess of loss reinsurance may be written in layers, in which a reinsurer or group of reinsurers accepts a band of coverage in excess of a specified amount, or retention, and up to a specified amount. Any liability exceeding the coverage limits of the reinsurance program is retained by the ceding company. The ceding company also bears the risk of a reinsurer's unwillingness or inability to pay. Consistent with general industry practices, we purchase excess of loss reinsurance to protect us against the impact of large individual, irregularly-occurring losses, and aggregate catastrophic losses from natural perils and terrorism, excluding nuclear, biological, 
9

chemical, and radiological events. Such reinsurance reduces the magnitude of such losses on our net income and the capital of our insurance subsidiaries.
Excess of Loss Reinsurance
Our current reinsurance program applies to all covered losses occurring between 12:01 a.m. July 1, 2018 and 12:01 a.m. July 1, 2019 and consists of one treaty covering excess of loss and catastrophic loss events in four layers of coverage. Our reinsurance coverage is $190.0 million in excess of our $10.0 million retention on a per occurrence basis, subject to certain exclusions. The coverage under our annual reinsurance programs that ended July 1, 2018 and 2017 was $190.0 million in excess of our $10.0 million retention on a per occurrence basis. We are solely responsible for any losses we suffer above $200.0 million except those covered by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (TRIPRA of 2015). See "—Terrorism Risk Insurance Program." Covered losses which occur prior to expiration or cancellation of the agreement continue to be obligations of the subscribing reinsurers, subject to the other conditions in the agreement. The subscribing reinsurers may terminate the agreement only for our breach of the obligations of the agreement. We are responsible for the losses if the subscribing reinsurer cannot or refuses to pay.
The agreement includes certain exclusions for which our subscribing reinsurers are not liable for losses, including but not limited to losses arising from the following: reinsurance assumed by us under pooling arrangements; financial guarantee and insolvency; certain nuclear risks; liability as a member, subscriber, or reinsurer of any pool, syndicate, or association, but not assigned risk plans; liability arising from participation or membership in any insolvency fund; loss or damage caused by war other than acts of terrorism or civil commotion; workers' compensation business covering persons employed in Minnesota; and any loss or damage caused by any act of terrorism involving biological, chemical, nuclear, or radioactive pollution or contamination. Our underwriting guidelines generally require that insured risks fall within the coverage provided in the reinsurance program. Executive review and approval would be required if we were to write risks outside the reinsurance program.
The agreement provides that we, or any subscribing reinsurer, may request commutation of any outstanding claim or claims 10 years after the effective date of termination or expiration of the agreements and provides a mechanism for the parties to achieve valuation for commutation. We may require a special commutation of the percentage share of any loss in the reinsurance program of any subscribing reinsurer that is in runoff.
We believe that our reinsurance program meets our current needs.
LPT Agreement
In 1999, the Fund entered into a retroactive 100% quota share reinsurance agreement through a loss portfolio transfer transaction with third party reinsurers. The LPT Agreement commenced on June 30, 1999 and will remain in effect until all claims under the covered policies have closed, the agreement is commuted, or terminated, upon the mutual agreement of the parties, or the reinsurers' aggregate maximum limit of liability is exhausted, whichever occurs earlier. The LPT Agreement does not provide for any additional termination terms. On January 1, 2000, EICN assumed all of the assets, liabilities and operations of the Fund, including the Fund's rights and obligations associated with the LPT Agreement.
Under the LPT Agreement, the Fund initially ceded $1.5 billion in liabilities for the incurred but unpaid losses and LAE related to claims incurred prior to July 1, 1995, for consideration of $775.0 million in cash. The LPT Agreement, which ceded to the reinsurers substantially all of the Fund's outstanding losses as of June 30, 1999 for claims with original dates of injury prior to July 1, 1995, provides coverage for losses up to $2.0 billion, excluding losses for burial and transportation expenses. The estimated remaining liabilities subject to the LPT Agreement were approximately $408.2 million and $438.9 million, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively (See Note 10 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Losses and LAE paid with respect to the LPT Agreement totaled approximately $773.7 million and $749.3 million through December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The reinsurers agreed to assume responsibilities for the claims at the benefit levels which existed in June 1999. The LPT Agreement required each reinsurer to place assets supporting the payment of claims by them in a trust that requires collateral be held at a specified level. The level must not be less than the outstanding reserve for losses and a loss expense allowance equal to 7% of estimated paid losses discounted at a rate of 6%. If the assets held in trust fall below this threshold, we may require the reinsurers to contribute additional assets to maintain the required minimum level of collateral. The value of these assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $311.6 million and $380.8 million, respectively.
The reinsurers currently party to the LPT Agreement are Chubb Bermuda Insurance Limited, XL Re Limited, and National Indemnity Company. The contract provides that during the term of the agreement all reinsurers need to maintain a rating of not less than “A-” (Excellent) as determined by A.M. Best. Currently, each of the reinsurers party to the LPT Agreement has a rating that satisfies this requirement.
We account for the LPT Agreement as retroactive reinsurance. Upon entry into the LPT Agreement, an initial deferred reinsurance gain was recorded as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Deferred Gain. We are also entitled to receive a contingent

profit commission under the LPT Agreement. The contingent profit commission is estimated based on both actual paid results to date and projections of expected paid losses under the LPT Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, our estimate of the ultimate expected contingent profit commission was $68.3 million, of which $36.4 million has been settled as of December 31, 2018.
Recoverability of Reinsurance
Reinsurance makes the assuming reinsurer liable to the ceding company to the extent of the reinsurance; however, it does not discharge the ceding company from its primary liability to its policyholders in the event the reinsurer cannot or refuses to pay its obligations under such reinsurance. We monitor the financial strength of our reinsurers and do not believe that we are currently exposed to any material credit risk as substantially all of our reinsurance is recoverable from large, well-capitalized reinsurance companies. At December 31, 2018, $2.0 million of our reinsurance recoverables were collateralized by cash or letters of credit and an additional $311.6 million was held in trust accounts for our benefit in support of reinsurance recoverables related to the LPT Agreement.
The following table provides information regarding our ceded reinsurance recoverables for losses and LAE as of December 31, 2018.

We review the aging of our reinsurance recoverables on a quarterly basis and no material amounts due from our reinsurers have been written-off as uncollectible since our inception in 2000. At December 31, 2018, less than 0.5% of our reinsurance recoverables on paid losses were greater than 90 days overdue.
Terrorism Risk Insurance Program
The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (2002 Act) was initially enacted in November 2002, modified and extended in 2005, again in 2007, and most recently in 2015. Now known as the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (TRIPRA of 2015), the program is designed to allow the insurance industry and the federal government to share losses from declared terrorist events according to a specific formula, and is in effect until December 31, 2020.
The workers' compensation laws of the various states generally do not permit the exclusion of coverage for losses arising from terrorism or nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attacks. In addition, we are not able to limit our losses arising from any one catastrophe or from any one claimant. Our reinsurance policies exclude coverage for losses arising out of nuclear, biological, 
11

chemical, or radiological attacks. Under TRIPRA of 2015, federal protection may be provided to the insurance industry for certain acts of foreign and domestic terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attacks.
The impacts of any future terrorist acts are unpredictable, and the ultimate impact on our insurance subsidiaries, if any, of losses from any future terrorist acts will depend upon their nature, extent, location, and timing. We monitor the geographic concentration of our policyholders to help mitigate the risk of loss from terrorist acts.
Investments
Our investment portfolio is structured to support our need for: (i) optimizing our risk-adjusted total return; (ii) providing adequate liquidity; (iii) facilitating financial strength and stability; and (iv) ensuring regulatory and legal compliance.
As of December 31, 2018, the total amortized cost of our investment portfolio was $2.7 billion and its fair value was $2.7 billion. These investments provide a steady source of income, which may fluctuate with changes in interest rates and our current investment strategies.
While we oversee all of our investment activities, we employ independent investment managers (Investment Managers). Our Investment Managers follow our written investment guidelines based upon strategies approved by our Board of Directors and our asset allocation is reevaluated by management and reviewed by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. We also utilize our Investment Managers' investment advisory services to assist us in developing a tailored set of portfolio targets and objectives.
Additional information regarding our investment portfolio, including our approach to managing investment risk, is set forth under “Item 7 –Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations –Liquidity and Capital Resources –Investments” and “Item 7A –Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”
Marketing and Distribution
We market our workers' compensation insurance products through independent local, regional, and national agents and brokers, through alternative distribution channels, including our largest partner ADP, Inc. (ADP) and national, regional, and local trade groups and associations, and direct-to-customer.
Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers
We establish and maintain strong, long-term relationships with independent insurance agencies that actively market our products and services. We offer ease of doing business, provide responsive service, and pay competitive commissions. Our sales representatives and underwriters work closely with independent agencies to market and underwrite our business. This results in enhanced understanding of the businesses and risks we underwrite and the needs of prospective customers. We do not delegate underwriting authority to agents or brokers. We are not dependent on any one agency and the loss of any one agency would not be material to our operations.
We had approximately 4,000 independent agencies that marketed and sold our insurance products at December 31, 2018. Independent agencies generated 76.7%, 72.8%, and 74.7% of in-force premiums at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and our largest agency generated two percent or less of our in-force premiums at each of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.
Alternative Distribution Channels
We have developed and continue to add to important distribution channels for our products and services that serve as an alternative to our strong independent agency distribution channel. These alternative distribution channels utilize partnerships and alliances with entities such as payroll companies and health care and property and casualty insurers for which we provide workers’ compensation insurance coverage. Our small business, low to medium hazard workers’ compensation insurance products are jointly offered and marketed with and through our partners and alliances.
Alternative distribution channels generated 23.1%, 21.6%, and 18.2% of our in-force premiums as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
A significant concentration of our business is being generated by ADP. ADP is the largest payroll services provider in the United States servicing small and medium-sized businesses. As part of its services, ADP sells our workers' compensation insurance product along with its payroll and accounting services through its insurance agency and field sales staff primarily to small businesses. ADP generated 13.1%, 13.9%, and 12.0% of our in-force premiums as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The majority of this business is written through ADP's small business unit, which has accounts of 1 to 50 employees. We pay ADP fees that are a percentage of premiums received for services provided through the ADP program.
Our relationship with ADP is non-exclusive; however, we believe we are a key partner of ADP for our selected markets and classes of business. Our agreement with ADP may be terminated at any time by either party without cause upon a 120 day notice.

Direct-to-Customer
To address the changing behaviors of small and micro-businesses, we recently launched Cerity Services, Inc. ("Cerity"), a subsidiary separate from our other insurance businesses, which offers digital, direct-to-customer workers' compensation insurance solutions. Cerity is based in Austin, Texas and began offering workers' compensation insurance in Illinois on January 23, 2019. Cerity focuses on a limited number of classes where we believe that customers prefer an online experience.
Competition and Market Conditions
The insurance industry is highly competitive, and there is significant competition in the national workers' compensation industry that is based on price and quality of services. We compete with other specialty workers' compensation carriers, state agencies, multi-line insurance companies, professional employer organizations, self-insurance funds, and state insurance pools. Many of our competitors are significantly larger, more widely known, and/or possess considerably greater financial resources. Our primary competitors are AmTrust Financial Services, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., ICW Group, and Travelers Insurance Group Holdings, Inc.
The workers' compensation sector continued to see average medical and indemnity claims costs increase, while the industry overall saw a decline in claim frequency in 2017, the most recent year for which industry data is available.
Regulation
State Insurance Regulation
Insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the insurance regulator in the state in which they are domiciled and, to a lesser extent, other states in which they conduct business. These state agencies have broad regulatory, supervisory, and administrative powers, including, among other things, the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact business, license agencies, set the standards of solvency to be met and maintained, determine the nature of, and limitations on, investments and dividends, approve policy forms and rates in some states, periodically examine financial statements, determine the form and content of required financial statements, set the rates that we may charge in some states, and periodically examine market conduct.
Detailed annual and quarterly financial statements, prepared in accordance with statutory accounting principles (SAP), and other reports are required to be filed with the insurance regulator in each of the states in which we are licensed to transact business. The California Department of Insurance (California DOI), Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (Florida OIR), and Nevada Division of Insurance (Nevada DOI) periodically examine the statutory financial statements of their respective domiciliary insurance companies. In 2015, the California DOI and Nevada DOI completed financial examinations for ECIC and EICN, respectively, and in 2016, the Florida OIR completed its regularly scheduled exams for EPIC and EAC. There were no material findings.
Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer's ability to withdraw from a particular market. For example, states may limit an insurer's ability to cancel or not renew policies. Furthermore, certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance regulator. The state insurance regulator may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption. We are subject to laws and regulations of this type, and these laws and regulations may restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets.
Holding Company Regulation. Nearly all states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems. Each insurance company in a holding company system is required to register with the insurance regulator of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. All transactions within a holding company system affecting an insurer must have fair and reasonable terms, the charges or fees for services performed must be reasonable, the insurer's total statutory surplus following any transaction must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its needs, and are subject to other standards and requirements established by law and regulation. Notice to state insurance regulators is required prior to the consummation of certain affiliated and other transactions involving our insurance subsidiaries and such transactions may be disapproved by the state insurance regulators.
Pursuant to applicable insurance holding company laws, EICN is required to register with the Nevada DOI, ECIC is required to register with the California DOI, and EPIC and EAC are required to register with the Florida OIR. Additionally, EPIC and EAC are commercially domiciled in California and are required to register with the California DOI. Under these laws, the respective state insurance regulators may examine us at any time, require disclosure of material transactions, and require prior notice for, or approval of, certain transactions. 
Change of Control. Our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in Florida, California and Nevada. The insurance laws of these states generally require that any person seeking to acquire control of a domestic insurance company obtain the prior approval of the state's insurance commissioner. In Florida, "control" is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of 5% or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or of any entity that controls a domestic insurance company. In California and Nevada, "control" is presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of 10% or more of the voting 
13

securities of a domestic insurance company or of any entity that controls a domestic insurance company. In addition, insurance laws in many states in which we are licensed require pre-notification to the state's insurance commissioner of a change in control of a non-domestic insurance company licensed in those states.
Statutory Accounting and Solvency Regulations. State insurance regulators closely monitor the financial condition of insurance companies reflected in financial statements based on SAP and can impose significant financial and operating restrictions on an insurance company that becomes financially impaired under SAP guidelines. State insurance regulators can generally impose restrictions or conditions on the activities of a financially impaired insurance company, including: the transfer or disposition of assets; the withdrawal of funds from bank accounts; payment of dividends or other distributions; the extension of credit or the advancement of loans; and investments of funds, including business acquisitions or combinations.
Financial, Dividend, and Investment Restrictions. State laws require insurance companies to maintain minimum levels of surplus and place limits on the amount of premiums a company may write based on the amount of that company's surplus. These limitations may restrict the rate at which our insurance operations can grow.
State laws also require insurance companies to establish reserves for payments of policyholder liabilities and impose restrictions on the kinds of assets in which insurance companies may invest. These restrictions may require us to invest in assets more conservatively than we would if we were not subject to state restrictions and may prevent us from obtaining as high a return on our assets as we might otherwise be able to realize absent the restrictions.
The ability of EHI to pay dividends on common stock, repurchase common stock, and to pay other expenses will be dependent to a significant extent upon the ability of our insurance subsidiaries (EICN, ECIC, EPIC, and EAC) to pay dividends to their immediate holding company, Employers Group, Inc. (EGI) and, in turn, the ability of EGI to pay dividends to EHI. Additional information regarding financial, dividend, and investment restrictions is set forth in Note 15 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Insurance Assessments. All of the states where our insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact business require property and casualty insurers doing business within the state to pay various insurance assessments. We accrue a liability for estimated insurance assessments as direct premiums are written, losses are recorded, or as other events occur in accordance with various states' laws and regulations, and defer these costs and recognize them as an expense as the related premiums are earned. Various mechanisms exist in some of these states for assessed insurance companies to recover certain assessments. Additional information regarding insurance assessments is set forth in Note 12 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Pooling Arrangements. As a condition to conducting business in some states, insurance companies are required to participate in mandatory workers' compensation shared market mechanisms, or pooling arrangements, which provide workers' compensation insurance coverage to private businesses that are otherwise unable to obtain coverage.
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The NAIC is a group formed by state insurance regulators to discuss issues and formulate policy with respect to regulation, reporting, and accounting of and by U.S. insurance companies. Although the NAIC has no legislative authority and insurance companies are at all times subject to the laws of their respective domiciliary states and other states in which they conduct business, the NAIC is influential in determining the form in which insurance laws are enacted. Model Insurance Laws, Regulations, and Guidelines (Model Laws) have been promulgated by the NAIC as a minimum standard by which state regulatory systems and regulations are measured. Adoption of state laws that provide for substantially similar regulations to those described in the Model Laws is a requirement for accreditation of state insurance regulatory agencies by the NAIC.
Under the Model Laws, insurers are required to maintain minimum levels of capital based on their investments and operations. These risk-based capital (RBC) requirements provide a standard by which regulators can assess the adequacy of an insurance company's capital and surplus relative to its operations. An insurance company must maintain capital and surplus of at least 200% of the RBC computed by the NAIC's RBC model, known as the “Authorized Control Level” of RBC. At December 31, 2018, each of our insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted capital in excess of the minimum RBC requirements.
The key financial ratios of the NAIC's Insurance Regulatory Information System (IRIS) were developed to assist state regulators in overseeing the financial condition of insurance companies. These ratios are reviewed by financial examiners of the NAIC and state insurance regulators for the purposes of detecting financial distress and preventing insolvency and to select those companies that merit highest priority in the allocation of the regulators' resources. IRIS identifies 13 key financial ratios and specifies a “usual range” for each. Departure from the usual ranges on four or more of the ratios can lead to inquiries from individual state insurance regulators as to certain aspects of an insurer's business. None of our insurance subsidiaries is currently subject to any action by any state regulator with respect to IRIS ratios.
