Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Kaya Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a vertically integrated legal marijuana enterprise, which cultivates, produces and retails legal medical and recreational cannabis in Oregon using its proprietary Kaya Shack™ brand. The Company currently operates a its chain of four retail Kaya Shack™ retail outlets (including three Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstores) in Oregon, has developed its own proprietary Kaya Farms™ strains of cannabis, which it grows and produces (together with edibles and other cannabis derivatives) at its Eugene, Oregon Sunstone Farms legal recreational and medical marijuana production and processing manufacturing facility, which it acquired in October 2018. The Company also owns a 26-acre parcel in Lebanon, Linn County, Oregon, which it purchased in August 2017 on which it intends to construct a cultivation and production facility. We filed for zoning and land use approval in early 2018, and after numerous regulatory challenges and delays, we finally received zoning and land use approval in January, 2019 to build an 85,000-square foot Kaya Farms™ greenhouse grow and production facility. The Company maintains a genetics library of over 30 strains of cannabis it has developed and has also formulated various edibles, cannabis derivatives and marijuana cigarettes under the “Kaya” brand name.
 
All of the Company’s operations are licensed by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (the “OLCC’), which has jurisdiction over legal medical and recreational cannabis grow, production and retail operations. The Company originally commenced operations in Oregon in July 2014, operating medical marijuana dispensaries (“MMDs”) when only medical marijuana sales had been legalized. However, this afforded the Company to be in position to rapidly move into the grow, production and retailing of recreational marijuana when legalization of recreational cannabis sales followed shortly thereafter in October 2015.
 
As Oregon has recently placed a moratorium on licensing additional legal marijuana retail outlets, the Company is exploring opportunities to expand its operations beyond Oregon by replicating its Kaya Shack™ brand retail outlets through franchising in other states where recreational cannabis use is legal or expected to become legal in the near term, as well as in Canada, where it is legal nationwide.

Market Overview
 
According to research firm Cowen & Co., legal cannabis sales in the U.S. are expected to reach $75 billion by 2030. The industry research firm Arcview, estimates a $22.6 billion legal cannabis market in North America by 2021, with 87% of all sales occurring in the United States. The Arcview forecast assumes a 27% compound annual growth rate, an assumption supported by current rates of growth, while reliant on additional states passing both recreational and medical cannabis laws.
 
Thirty-three states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana in some capacity. Additionally, ten states (Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington State) and the District of Colombia have approved the implementation of legal recreational marijuana use. The Marijuana Business Factbook 2017, published by industry news source Marijuana Business Daily, estimates that the legal marijuana sector will grow more than 300% from sales of $1.8 billion to $17.1 billion in 2021. The firm estimates that the economic impact of the legal cannabis industry will exceed $70 billion, placing it almost on par with nutraceuticals and ahead of movie tickets and retail ice cream. According to the Factbook, “to get another idea of just how big the marijuana industry has become, look to employment numbers. The cannabis sector now employs between 165,000-230,000 full and part-time workers….to put this in perspective, there are now more marijuana industry workers than there are bakers or massage therapists in the United States”.

The Kaya Shack™ Brand 
 

Kaya Holdings operates the Kaya Shack™ brand of legal medical and recreational retail marijuana retail stores.
 
Kaya Holdings operates four recreational marijuana retail outlets and medical marijuana dispensaries in Oregon under the Kaya Shack™ brand.
 Dubbed by the mainstream press as the “Starbucks of Marijuana” after our first outlet opened in July 2014, our operating concept is simple: to deliver a consistent customer experience (quality products, fair prices and superior customer service) to a broad and diverse base of customers. Kaya Shack™ meets the quality needs of the “marijuana enthusiast”, the comfort and atmosphere of all including “soccer moms” and the price sensitivities of casual smokers.
 
The Kaya Shack™ brand communicates positive thinking and joy, with signs adorning the walls that read “It’s a Good Day to have a Good Day,” “Some of our Happiest Days Haven’t Even Happened Yet,” and our signature “Be Kind.”
 
Kaya Shack™ retail outlets are open 7 days a week- Monday through Saturday from 8:00 am to 10:00 pm, and Sunday 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM. Operations follow an operational manual that details procedures for 18 areas of operation including safety, compliance, store opening, store closing, merchandising, handling of cash, inventory control, product intake, store appearance and employee conduct.
 
In compliance with regulations, all marijuana and marijuana infused products sold through our stores are quality tested by independent labs to assure adherence to strict quality and OLCC regulations.
 
The Company is exploring opportunities to expand its operations beyond Oregon by replicating its Kaya Shack™ brand retail outlets through franchising in other states where recreational cannabis use is legal or expected to become legal in the near term, as well as in Canada, where it is legal nationwide. KAYS also is targeting opening corporate owned marijuana production and processing facilities to support the envisioned franchised outlets, and to both maintain quality control and offer customers a consistent customer experience while reducing costs of goods to franchisees.

Plan to Sell Kaya Shack™ Retail Marijuana Store Franchises in Canada
 

On March 12, 2019 the Company announced that it had hired the Toronto based law firm of Garfinkle Biderman LLP to prepare the legal infrastructure required to enable the Company to sell Kaya Shack™ franchises in Canada. The Company has since concluded negotiations with its selected Canadian based franchise sales consultancy group and has hosted a group of prospective franchisees. The Company is currently working with its consulting group to map out Canadian provinces and development plans that consider the current and pending availability of cannabis retail licenses. Kaya Holdings will continue to announce details of its Canadian expansion effort as developments unfold.
Kaya Shack™ Car Fleet and Home Delivery
 

The Company is licensed by the OLCC for home delivery for all four stores. The Company is interested in developing its delivery service and has a fleet of 4 Kaya Cars (wrapped Fiat 500s featuring the Company’s branding logos and colors and outfitted with safes and security) at the ready, and once the support software enabling compliant delivery is released Kaya Shack™ will commence with its home delivery service. We expect delivery to extend our visibility, assist in building brand awareness, and allow the Company to service a broader geographic territory. The Company has developed the website www.kayadelivers.com to advance the growth of its delivery service.
 
To make use of the cars while the Company waits to launch delivery service, the cars are currently used for promotional purposes at community fairs and roving billboards.

Kaya Farms™ 
 

Lebanon, Linn County, Oregon Marijuana Grow and Manufacturing Complex
 

In early 2015, KAYS commenced its own medical marijuana grow operations for the cultivation and harvesting of legal marijuana thereby becoming the first publicly traded U.S. company to own a majority interest in a vertically integrated legal marijuana enterprise in the United States. Since that time KAYS has operated various grow facilities to feed the Kaya Shack Supply Chain, and in August 2017, KAYS acquired its first property for a large scale facility- a 26-acre parcel in Lebanon, Linn County, Oregon, where we intend to develop an 85,000-square foot Kaya Farms™ Farm and greenhouse facility
 

Management believes that the acquisition and development of the property will position the Company for future growth and expansion, including increased Marijuana Canopy production to the maximum extent allowed by law through use of both greenhouse and outdoor grows, as well as expansion of its production capabilities with brands in oils, vape cartridges, concentrates, a selection of edibles, and infused creams and lotions. When Federal Prohibition of marijuana ends and national and international cannabis trade can begin, we believe that Oregon is uniquely positioned to become America’s “pot basket” due to its superior climate and state history involving generations of Oregonian Cannabis Growers; ideal weather + extensive generational knowledge = superior, lower cost cannabis products for export.
 
We filed for zoning and land use approval in early 2018, and after numerous regulatory challenges and delays, we finally received zoning and land use approval in early 2019 to build on the property. We are presently in the final planning stages and are awaiting the culmination of the OLCC licensing process to begin construction. Under present laws the property can easily deliver 6-8,000 pounds of cannabis each year; if future regulations permit we believe that we can expand that capability to approximately 80-100,000 pounds of cannabis each year.

Kaya Farms Indoor Marijuana Grow, Processing & Cannaceutical Production Facility

 
On October 23, 2018 KAYS announced that it had concluded the purchase of the Eugene, Oregon based Sunstone Farms grow and manufacturing facility, which is licensed by the OLCC for both the production (growing) of medical and recreational marijuana flower and the processing of cannabis concentrates/extracts/edibles. The purchase includes a 12,000 square foot building housing an indoor grow facility, as well as equipment for growing and extraction activity. The facility can produce in excess of 800 pounds cannabis flower annually as currently outfitted, as well as a substantial amount of manufactured extracts and related cannabis products.

The purchase price of $1.3 million for the OLCC licensed marijuana production and processing facility, consisting of the building and equipment was paid for by the issuance of 12 million shares of KAYS restricted stock to the seller at closing. The shares carry a lock-up-restriction that allows for their staged eligibility for resale over a 61-month period from the date of the purchase of the facility by KAYS.
 Additionally, the seller purchased 2.5 million restricted shares for $250,000 in cash in a private transaction with the Company. The proceeds from the sale of those shares were and are being used for acquisition related expenses, transitional operating costs and facility capital improvements with respect to the production and processing facility we purchased.
 KAYS intends to utilize the processing facilities to grow their own top-shelf, connoisseur-grade marijuana flower, produce various brands of oils, edibles, concentrates and extracts, and develop medical grade laboratory facilities for the production of a proprietary Kaya Cannaceuticals™ line of both CBD and CBD/THC products for the health, skincare and medical industries.

Pursuant to an interim Management Agreement entered into between the parties, the Company has assumed operations of the 12,000-square foot facility pending transfer of the licenses by the OLCC to the Company, upon completion of a satisfactory compliance review. As part of planned expansion and renovations for the facility, KAYS began site improvements and has begun supplying its four Kaya Shack™ retail outlets with Kaya Farms™ cannabis and cannabis products from the facility

Acquisition of the Eugene, Oregon facility has enabled the Company to recommence its Kaya Farms™ cannabis grow, processing and manufacturing operations. Please see the following pages for copies of testing results and pictures of various aspects of production.

Kaya Farms™ - Cannabis and Cannabis Products
 Kaya Buddie™ Strain Specific Cannabis Cigarettes
In 2016 the Company introduced a signature line of strain-specific connoisseur-grade, pre-rolled cannabis cigarettes branded as “Kaya Buddies™”. Kaya Buddies™ cannabis cigarettes have been very well received by medical patients and recreational users, with the Company selling over 100,000 Kaya Buddies™ since launching the brand in January 2016. The brand, marketed under the tagline “Buds with Benefits”, features over 50 different strains of connoisseur-grade, high quality cannabis and proprietary specialty blends. Many cannabis retailers produce prerolls, but none that we know of offer strain specific preroll made from the buds of the flower.

Potential Expansion
 

We believe that revenues and profitability will be enhanced through the opening, directly or through franchisees or licensees, of additional retail outlets utilizing the Kaya Shack™ brand and model in our chain, as well as economies of scale achieved by being a multi-location retail chain and being vertically integrated with grow and manufacturing operations. Ultimately, we believe that we can successfully enter other markets as they open up by applying our “brand” retail chain and vertically integrated grow and manufacture model to other states that legalize recreational marijuana use.
 
As Oregon has recently placed a moratorium on licensing additional legal marijuana retail outlets, the Company is exploring opportunities to expand its operations beyond Oregon by replicating its Kaya Shack™ brand retail outlets through franchising in other states where recreational cannabis use is legal or expected to become legal in the near term, as well as in Canada, where it has recently been legalized nationwide.


Growth Strategy
 
The Company has established a well-defined strategy for entering and maintaining a strong presence in the legal marijuana sector. The cornerstones of this strategy include:
 

· | All operations are to be conducted in accordance with State and Local Laws and Federal Enforcement Policies and Priorities as it relates to Marijuana (as outlined in the Justice Department's Cole Memo dated August 29, 2013, US Attorney General Jeff Sessions Memo dated January 4, 2018, and subsequent commentary from US Attorney for the District of Oregon Billy Williams). 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Company will seek to operate in a vertically integrated manner (grow, process and sell) wherever permitted by law. In states or countries where vertical integration is not permitted, the Company plans to determine which of the permitted activities offers the most potential for growth and value creation. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Company will seek to engage, sponsor or lead local advocacy and lobbying groups that have a significant impact on the evolution and character of laws and the regulations under which legal marijuana operations are implemented in select markets. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Company shall work with law enforcement and government officials to insure compliance with all regulations. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marketing and Sales
 
The Company will only market its legal marijuana as in compliance with applicable state law.
 
The Company employs a marketing campaign consisting of four cornerstones:
 

· | Promoting and establishing the Kaya Shack™ brand. 
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | A positive and active online presence. 
--+-------------------------------------------


· | Daily specials and promotions. 
--+-----------------------------------


· | Quirky and fun holiday specials. 
--+-------------------------------------

 
32



Our core strategic marketing objectives include:
 

Establishing and Enhancing the Kaya Shack™ Brand – positioning the Company’s brand to have positive and value related associations with all prospective and existing customers. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Operating Cooperatively - cooperation, as a strategy, helps develop a network of suppliers and marketing channels able to promote Kaya Shack™. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Delivering Value - customer value is achieved when the perceived value of what we sell along with the value of the experience we deliver exceeds the price we charge. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Driving Customer Traffic - the only two ways to increase store income is to sell more to our existing customers and attract new customers. Programs are in place to accomplish both tasks. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Government Regulation
 
We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws directly applicable to our operations. As we continue to expand the scope of our operations, the application of existing laws and regulations could include matters such as pricing, advertising, consumer protection, quality of products, and intellectual property ownership. In addition, we will also be subject to new laws and regulations directly applicable to our activities.
 
Any existing or new legislation applicable to us could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations, which could hinder or prevent the growth of our business.
 
Federal, state and local laws and regulations governing legal recreational and medical marijuana use are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance. In addition, violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our planned business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that additional or revised federal, state and local laws and regulations may be enacted in the future governing the legal marijuana industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with any such laws and regulations and its failure to do so could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Competition
 
The legal marijuana sector is rapidly growing and the Company faces significant competition in the operation of retail outlets, MMDs and grow facilities. Many of these competitors will have far greater experience, more extensive industry contacts and greater financial resources than the Company. There can be no assurance that we can adequately compete to succeed in our business plan.
Employees
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, our Oregon operations have a total of 15-20 part-time store employees including budtenders, trimmers, growers, and 6 full-time employees, consisting of 3 store managers, a Vice President of Marketing and Brand development, the Senior Vice President of Cannabis Operations and a Vice President of Cultivation. Additionally, we engage several consultants to assist with daily duties and business plan implementation and execution. Additional employees will be hired and other consultants engaged in the future as our business expands.
