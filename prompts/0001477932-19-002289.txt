Our Company
 
DAVIDsTEA is a branded retailer of specialty tea, offering a differentiated selection of proprietary loose-leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets, tea-related gifts, accessories, food and beverages primarily through 237 company-operated DAVIDsTEA stores as of February 2, 2019, and our website, davidstea.com. We offer primarily proprietary tea blends that are exclusive to DAVIDsTEA, as well as traditional single-origin teas and herbs. Our passion for and knowledge of tea permeates our culture and is rooted in an excitement to explore the taste, health and lifestyle elements of tea. 
 
In our retail stores, we strive to make the enjoyment of tea a multi‑sensory experience by facilitating customers’ interaction with our products through education and sampling, which allows our customers the opportunity to appreciate the compelling attributes of tea as well as the ease of preparation. We design our stores with a modern and minimalistic aesthetic that, coupled with our teal‑colored logo, create an inviting atmosphere and stand in stark contrast to common perceptions of tea as a more traditional product. Our in‑store “Tea Guides” help novice and experienced tea drinkers alike select from the approximately 135 premium teas and tea blends featured on our “Tea Wall,” which is the focal point of our stores. 
 
Our website presents customers with educational information to guide their exploration of tea, serving a similar function as the “Tea Guides” in our retail stores. Additionally, on our website customers can purchase our full assortment of premium loose‑leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts and accessories, as well as certain products that are exclusive to our website. 
 
We have a dedicated and highly experienced product development team that is constantly creating new tea blends using high‑quality ingredients from around the world and identifying new tea products designed to match customers’ tastes as they evolve. We capitalize on our product development capabilities by rotating new tea blends each year into our offering. The product development team also infuses innovation into our loose-leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts, accessories, food and beverages, providing our customers with fun, inventive and convenient ways to enjoy tea.

We intend to focus our attention on continuing to improve and develop new and innovative teas products and tea-related gift offerings. To enhance our retail operations, we plan to reinvigorate our stores through creative merchandising that better highlights the functional benefits of our growing wellness collection of teas. We plan to grow our latte and custom beverage experience and offerings. We also plan to build on the investments we have already made in our website. Aiming to simulate for our online customers the experience of our retail stores, we plan to provide customers additional expertise published by our Tea Guides, a community-focused platform that builds on our existing customers and fans, and other features designed to facilitate our customers in their discovery of tea. Relatedly, we also plan to continue to implement new digital marketing strategies not only to retain the business of existing customers, but to also increase brand awareness and attractiveness to potential new customers. Finally, we intend to expand our wholesale channel, strategically placing our tea products in specialty grocery stores, pharmacies, hotels and restaurants, which will allow us to continue to enhance brand awareness of DAVIDsTEA throughout Canada and the United States. 
 
Our Market and Competition
 
The markets for tea products in Canada and the United States are highly fragmented. We compete with a large number of relatively small independently owned tea retailers and a number of regional tea retailers, as well as retailers of grocery products, including loose‑leaf teas, tea sachets and tea-related beverages. We also compete with other vendors of loose‑leaf teas, tea sachets and ready‑to‑drink teas, such as club stores, wholesalers and internet suppliers, as well as with houseware retailers and suppliers that offer tea wares and related accessories.
 
We believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors because we are considered by our customers as tea experts and by the excellence of our blended and straight teas, through our distinct retail experience, our broad product offering that ranges from loose leaf tea to beverage to ready-to-drink (“RTD”), the potential broad demographic appeal of our brand, innovative tea products driven by customer insights, the effectiveness of our website, www.davidstea.com, and digital and community focused marketing strategies, and our passionate customer-focused culture supported by our experienced management team and dedicated board members. 
 
Our Product Offerings
 
We offer a significant variety of premium loose‑leaf teas and pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts and accessories. We also offer on‑the‑go tea beverages in our retail stores.
Teas
 
Our loose‑leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts can be enjoyed by consumers at home, on‑the‑go or at work. Our different flavors of loose-leaf tea span eight different tea categories: white, green, oolong, black, pu’erh, mate, rooibos and herbal tea. Our tea collection features over 30% certified organic tea, and to our knowledge makes us the largest organic loose-leaf provider on the market. We carry only responsibly sourced and fairtrade certified blends. Our teas and ingredients used in our tea blends are sourced from various regions around the world, including from China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, India, Nepal, Kenya, Sri Lanka and South Africa. In addition to loose‑leaf teas, we sell pre‑packaged teas and tea sachets to make the tea experience more convenient. Our tea-related gifts include special edition seasonal and holiday gift packages as well as novelty themed gifts that continue to innovate with new themes, seasonal collections and visually-appealing gift boxes designed for entertaining. Our tea gifts are all either fully recyclable or compostable. 
Tea Accessories
 
Our tea accessories are created to make the tea preparation process and tea experience more convenient, fun and easy at home or on-the-go. Tea accessories include tea mugs, travel mugs, teacup sets, teapots, tea makers, kettles, infusers, filters, frothers, tins and spoons. Many of our accessories are crafted with unique functional features to improve tea preparation and consumption as well as with visually-appealing colors and designs consistent with our brand aesthetic.
Food and Beverages
 
Our retail stores offer tea beverages and food products for on‑the‑go consumption. Our beverages range from standard hot or iced tea to our “Tea Lattes”.

Distinctive Retail Experience
 
The DAVIDsTEA experience starts with our in-store Tea Guides. Our employees’ passions for tea and wellness permeate our culture and are rooted in a deep knowledge of, and desire to share, the compelling attributes of tea. A key element of the retail experience is our “Tea Wall,” a focal point of the store. Our Tea Guides help to create a highly interactive and immersive multi-sensory experience for our customers. The Tea Guides facilitate customers’ interaction with our products through education and sampling, which allows our customers the opportunity to appreciate the compelling attributes of tea as well as the ease of preparation. Every visit to our stores is designed to create a sense of adventure for our customers, novice and experienced tea drinkers alike, as our knowledgeable, personable and passionate Tea Guides assist our customers in navigating the “Tea Wall” by selecting a variety of teas for customers to smell based on their taste preferences. 
Site Selection and Store Portfolio
 
We seek to maintain our stores in strategic locations that support the brand image, targeting high customer traffic locations primarily within malls, including lifestyle centers and outlets, and on street locations. We regularly review our store portfolio, identifying new store locations and monitoring existing locations for sufficient levels of customer traffic to maintain successful stores. We actively monitor and manage the performance of our stores and increasingly seek to incorporate information learned through the monitoring process into our analyses for future site selection and store retention decisions.
Store Management, Culture and Training
 
We are guided by a philosophy that recognizes customer service and the importance of delivering optimal performance, allowing us to identify and reward teams that meet our high standards. We use store-level scorecards that report key performance indicators, and we provide our store managers with a number of analytical tools to assist them in attaining optimum store performance including access to the key performance indicator reports, coaching logs for one‑on‑one meetings, weekly one‑on‑one meetings between our store managers and district managers, and annual evaluations. While our focus is on the overall performance of the team and our stores, we provide incentives to individual team members, store managers and district managers to encourage success.

· | Passion for Tea. We believe our passionate Tea Guides are a major element of our retail experience. We seek to recruit, hire, train, retain and promote qualified, knowledgeable and enthusiastic team members who share our passion for tea and strive to deliver an extraordinary retail experience to our customers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Extensive Training. We have specific training and certification requirements for all new team members, including undergoing food handlers’ certification and foundational training. This process helps ensure that all team members educate our customers and execute our standards accurately and consistently. As team members progress to the assistant manager and manager levels, they undergo additional weeks of training in sales, operations and management.
· | Career Development and Individual Enrichment. We track and reward team member performance, which we believe incentivizes excellence and helps us identify top performers. Identifying such talent integral in supporting our growth, as many of our store managers and district managers are promoted from within our organization. In addition, we provide our employees with career development and opportunities for individual enrichment and empowerment. 

 
Our rewarding corporate culture allows us to attract passionate and friendly employees who share a vision of making tea fun and accessible – which we believe is a key contributor to our success – and also reflects our belief in community engagement and doing right by our customers and employees. 
 
Digital Retail
 
Our website, www.davidstea.com, features our full assortment of premium loose‑leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts and accessories. To drive increased sales through our website, we utilize online‑specific marketing and promotions in addition to employing banner advertisements, search engine optimization and pay‑per‑click arrangements to help drive customer traffic to our website. We will be introducing new marketing and core gap features that will further enhance the website experience and improve its accessibility for mobile users. 
 
Through our website, we can reach customers who may not live near one of our retail locations. We believe our website and our stores are complementary, as our website provides our store customers an additional channel through which to purchase our teas and tea‑related products while also helping drive awareness of and customer traffic to our stores.

Wholesale 
 
We currently sell tea products to Hotel, Restaurant and Institution (“HRI”) distribution channels. In Fiscal 2018, we launched several select pre-packaged sachet offerings with a national Canadian grocer. We believe that the broad distribution of select tea blends helps to service not only existing customers but also attract new customers to our exclusive sachet tea offerings, while ultimately also driving greater brand awareness and traffic to our online and retail stores where our full selection of products including loose-leaf tea blends and packaged gifts become available. 
Marketing and Advertising
 
We differentiate our business through a field‑based marketing approach to build brand awareness and drive customers to our stores and website in both new and existing markets. Our events sponsorship group engages directly in the communities around our stores, driving store visits by participating in both hyper‑local and large‑scale events where they offer product samplings and beverage coupons. These events are customized for each of our markets and are identified and coordinated by our local store managers and Tea Guides with support from our dedicated corporate events team.
 
In addition, we continue to leverage our growing digital presence, including through Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, LinkedIn, YouTube, Snapchat and Yelp, to increase our website sales and drive additional store visits within existing and new markets. Our marketing and advertising efforts are led by a strong marketing and merchandising team.
 
Product Development and Design
 
Our tea and merchandising teams travel throughout the world seeking premium teas and tea-related products. These teams consist of Tea Blend Developers, Product Designers, Category Merchants and Quality Control Personnel, who leverage our extensive experience in selecting and developing our product assortment. We constantly explore distinctive ingredients, flavors and trends that are popular in a variety of cultures, which we introduce to our customers through their incorporation in new teas. Our research and development team works with our blenders and suppliers to create new and exciting flavors of tea, which we rotate into our product offerings to attract new customers and to continue to pique the interest of existing customers. Our blending process focuses on magnifying the senses and bringing smell and taste to the forefront. We introduce new flavors and blends each month as well as around seasonal holidays. Through extensive research, we have identified key customer segments and preferences to help evaluate our product assortment and we have developed an effective product release cadence. We believe our focus on innovation and continual product development are key differentiating factors for our brand that drives our customers’ loyalty and supports our efforts to attract new customers.
 
Our innovation also extends to creating new and exciting merchandise to make the tea consumption and experience more convenient and stimulating at home or on-the-go. Since our merchandising team designs and develops most of our products in‑house, we are better positioned than our competitors who do not have such an in-house function to create the unique and proprietary designs that make consuming loose‑leaf tea easier and more fun for our customers. We believe the combination of our product selection and our product innovation allows us to offer customers a distinctive assortment that differentiates us from other specialty tea retailers.
 
Sourcing and Manufacturing
 
We do not own or operate any tea estates or blending operations; instead, we work with vendors who source ingredients for our teas and tea blends from all over the world. The majority of our tea blenders are in either Germany or the United States. Since we founded the Company in 2008, we have developed strong relationships with our vendors. These relationships are important, as we depend on our vendors to provide us with the highest quality teas and ingredients from around the world. Our quality control process includes both in-house testing and vendor testing. Therefore, in addition to bringing our designs for tea blends to fruition, our vendors play an important role in quality control and in ensuring our teas meet applicable regulatory guidelines. Our tea merchandise is sourced from a number of suppliers who manufacture to our unique and proprietary designs.
Warehouse and Distribution Facilities
 
We distribute our loose-leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts, accessories to our stores and our online customers from distribution centers in Montréal, Québec, Sherbrooke, Québec and Champlain, New York. We use third-party logistics facilities in Sherbrooke, Québec and Champlain, New York. The Sherbrooke facility ships to our Canadian stores and Canadian online customers. The Champlain, New York facility ships to all our U.S. stores and to our U.S. online customers. Our products are typically shipped to our stores and our online customers via third‑party national transportation providers multiple times per week.

Management Information Systems
 
Our management information systems provide a full range of business process supports to our stores, our store operations and service support center teams. Additionally, we operate our website on an independent platform. We utilize a combination of industry‑standard and customized software systems to provide various functions related to point of sales, inventory management, warehouse management, and accounting and financial reporting.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to labor and employment laws, import and trade restrictions laws, laws governing advertising, privacy and data security laws, safety regulations, and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that apply to retailers and/or the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. In the United States, we are subject to the regulatory authority of, among other agencies, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). We are also subject to the laws of Canada, including the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, as well as provincial and local regulations. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws.
Insurance
 
We maintain third-party insurance for a number of risk management activities including, but not limited to, workers’ compensation, general liability, property, directors and officers, cyber insurance and employee-related health care benefits. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to ensure that we maintain adequate levels of coverage. 
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
 
We regard intellectual property and other proprietary rights as important to our success. In addition to registered intellectual property, such as our patents and marks, we also rely upon trade secrets and know‑how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our intellectual property rights through a variety of methods, including by availing ourselves of trademark and trade secret laws and by entering into confidentiality agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and others who have access to our proprietary information.
 
We own several trademarks and servicemarks that have been registered with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, including DAVIDsTEA®. We have also registered our stylized logos, and we own domain names, including www.davidstea.com. In addition, we have registered or have applied to register one or more of our marks in a number of foreign countries and expect to continue to do so in the future. However, we cannot be certain that we can obtain the registration for the marks in every country where we apply for registration.
 
We must constantly protect against any infringement by competitors. If we believe a competitor has infringed or is infringing upon our rights, we may take legal action, which could result in litigation, in which case we may incur significant expenses and divert significant attention from our business operations.
 
Employees
 
As of the end of Fiscal 2018, we had 2,901 associates. As of February 2, 2019, we employed a total of 487 full‑time employees and 2,414 part‑time employees, with 467 in the United States and 2,434 in Canada. Of all those employees, 2,671 were employed in our store network and 230 were employed in corporate, distribution and direct channel support functions. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We believe we have a good relationship with our employees.
Seasonality
 
Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations, reflecting increased sales during the holiday season in November and December. Our sales and income are generally highest in the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday sales period, and tends to be lowest in the second and third fiscal quarters. Therefore, operating results for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year. To prepare for the holiday season, we must increase our inventory levels above those maintained during the rest of the year. We expect inventory levels, along with an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, to reach their highest levels in the third and fourth quarters in anticipation of the increased net sales during the holiday season. As a result of this seasonality, and generally because of variations in consumer spending habits, we experience fluctuations in net sales, earnings and working capital requirements during the year.
