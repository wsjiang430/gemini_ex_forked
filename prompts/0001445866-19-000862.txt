ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to “GB” and “GB Sciences” refers solely to GB Sciences, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and all references to “the Company,” “we”, “us” or “our” in this Annual Report refers to GB Sciences and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Overview
 
The Company seeks to be an innovative technology and solution company that converts the cannabis plant into medicines, therapies and treatments for a variety of ailments. The Company is developing and utilizing state of the art technologies in plant biology, cultivation and extraction techniques, combined with biotechnology, and plans to produce consistent and measurable medical-grade cannabis, cannabis concentrates and cannabinoid therapies.
 
We seek to become a trusted producer of consistent and efficacious medicinal strains and products, combining both cannabinoids and terpenes, which we intend to market in those states within the United States and in other countries where the sale of medical cannabis products are permitted. In addition, subject to obtaining Food and Drug Administrative (FDA) certification, we intend to market our cannabinoid-based drug discoveries on a world-wide basis.
 
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 4, 2001, under the name “Flagstick Venture, Inc.” On March 28, 2008, stockholders owning a majority of our outstanding common stock approved changing our then name “Signature Exploration and Production Corp.” as our business model had changed. 
 
On March 13, 2014, we entered into a definitive assets purchase agreement for the acquisition of assets, including the Growblox™ cultivation technology which resulted in a change in our corporate name on April 4, 2014, from Signature Exploration and Production Corporation to Growblox Sciences, Inc. 

4


Effective December 12, 2016, the Company amended its Certificate of Corporation pursuant to shareholder approval as reported in the Form 8-K filed on October 14, 2016. Pursuant to the amendment the Company’s name was changed from Growblox Sciences, Inc. to GB Sciences, Inc. 
 
Effective April 8, 2018, Shareholders of the Company approved the change in corporate domicile from the State of Delaware to the State of Nevada and increase in the number of authorized capital shares from 250,000,000 to 400,000,000.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
GB Sciences intends to operate as an intellectual property company that will conduct its business through its subsidiaries. GB Sciences intends to own all patents and related technologies developed by it and its subsidiaries. In addition, the Company owns and will seek to own majority interests in each of its existing and future operating subsidiaries.
 
Although we believe that maximum shareholder value will ultimately be achieved through the development, production and marketing of certified cannabinoid medicines, therapies and treatments, in order to generate cash flow and near-term profitability, we cultivate and dispense cannabis for medical and recreational purposes in Nevada and Louisiana. Additionally, we intend to cultivate and dispense cannabis in other states which permit such sales and in which we and our operating partners are able to obtain cultivation and dispensing licenses.
 
Drug Discovery and Development of Novel Cannabis-Based Therapies
 
Through its wholly-owned, Canadian subsidiary, GBS Global Biopharma, Inc. (GBSGB), the Company has conducted ground-breaking research embracing the complexity of the whole plant led by Dr. Andrea Small-Howard, the Company’s Chief Science Officer, and Dr. Helen Turner, Vice President of Innovation and Dean of the Science and Technology Department at Chaminade University.  Small-Howard and Turner posited that complex mixtures of cannabinoids and terpenes that are derived from native mixtures in the cannabis plant, but with precise optimizations, would provide more targeted and effective treatments for specific disease conditions than either single cannabinoids or whole plant formulations.  They developed a rapid screening and assaying system which tested thousands of combinations of cannabinoids and terpenes in vitro against cell-based models of disease.  This process identified precise mixtures of cannabinoids and terpenes, many of which contained no THC, to treat categories of disease conditions, including neurological disorders, inflammation, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, chronic and neuropathic pain.
 
GBSGB’s drug discovery process combines: 1) HTS: high throughput screening of tens of thousands of combinations of compounds derived from specific chemovars of the cannabis plant in well-established cellular models of diseases, and 2) NPP: a proprietary Network Pharmacology Platform algorithm for the prediction of complex therapeutic mixtures that the Company spent two-and-a-half-years training and testing against cell assay data. This combined approach to drug discovery increases research efficiency and accuracy reducing the time from ideation to patenting from 7 years to 1.5 years. Screening of cannabis-based mixtures for drug discovery involves the testing of specific combinations of plant chemicals from many naturally occurring cannabis chemovars and the use of live models for these diseases that have been well established by other researchers. First, the Company finds chemovars that show some therapeutic activity, and then refines these natural mixtures to optimize their effectiveness in cellular assays by removing compounds that do not act synergistically with the others in the mixtures.  The Company also use its internally-validated Network Pharmacology Platform to prioritize and eliminate some potential combinations, which reduces the time in the discovery period.
 
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office allows complex mixtures to be claimed as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients, and GBSGB has a series of patents containing cannabis-derived complex mixtures that act as therapeutic agents for specific disease categories, as described below. GBSGB’s patents are protected whether the individual compounds are derived from the cannabis plant, another plant, synthetically produced, or derived from a combination of sources for the individual chemical compounds in these mixtures.

Executive Summary of Research & Development Progress by GBS Global Biopharma, Inc. (“GBSGB”)
 
GBS Global Biopharma, Inc. has made significant strides in the past year with respect to both discovery research and product development programs. Both lead Rx programs 
in Parkinson’s disease and chronic neuropathic pain are now in preclinical animal studies with Dr. Lee Ellis of the NRC in Halifax. 
For chronic neuropathic pain, GBSGB is testing its Myrcene-Containing Complex Mixtures (MCCM) both as encapsulated, time-released nanoparticles, as well as in non-encapsulated forms of these therapeutic mixtures. For Parkinson’s disease, the initial clinical prototypes of GBSGB Cannabinoid-Containing Complex Mixtures (CCCM) are being formulated by Catalent Pharma using Catalent’s Zydis® Orally Disintegrating Tablet technology. Catalent has reported that the prototypes passed the initial Feasibility Testing Phase, and Catalent is now working on the Proof of Concept Study with our GBS101.PD, GBS102.PD, and GBS103.PD formulations. Three new patent applications were filed, two new patent applications are being prepared for filings, and we have licensed another patented delivery method, oral thin films. We are also raising awareness of our work through six peer-reviewed journal articles and a dozen presentations at national and international meetings. Favorable Research Updates from our university collaborators reveal the promise in our discovery programs with Michigan State University (HIV-Associated Neurodegenerative Disorder), Chaminade University (Neuropathic Pain, Metabolic Syndrome), the University of Athens, Greece (Cannabis Metabolomics), and the University of Seville, Spain (Time-Released Nanoparticles). The University of Seville has completed functional testing on nanoparticles containing myrcene, nerolidol, and beta-caryophyllene. In these cell-based assays, the effectiveness and kinetics of the nanoparticle-forms of these terpenes were compared with the “naked” terpenes both individually and in mixtures. In all cases, the effectiveness of the nanoparticles were superior to the naked terpenes, however, the mixtures were dramatically more effective than the individuals. These results from Seville are very promising as these nanoparticles are now entering the animal testing phase at the NRC in Halifax.

Partnering Strategy
 
GBSGB runs a lean drug development program and minimizes expenses, including personnel, overhead, and fixed capital expenses (such as lab and diagnostic equipment), through strategic partnerships with Universities and Contract Research Organizations (“CROs”). Through these research and development agreements, GBSGB has created a virtual pipeline for the further development of novel medicines extracted from the cannabis plant. The partners bring both expertise and infrastructure at a reasonable cost to the life sciences program. GBSGB has also negotiated with these partners to keep 100% of the ownership of the IP within GBSGB for original patent filings.
 
GBSGB currently has active and on-going research agreements with the following institutions covering the indicated areas of research:
 
·    Chaminade University: Broad-based research program to support the drug discovery platform that has yielded most of GBSGB’s original patents to date in the areas of neurodegenerative diseases, heart disease, inflammatory diseases, neuropathic pain and chronic pain.
 ·    Michigan State University: Discovery work using a cutting-edge, multi-cellular model of the human immune system and a multi-cell model of the brain to explore CCCM™s for use as an adjunctive therapy to anti-retroviral cocktails for HIV/AIDS patients and to define CCCM™s for use in the prevention of HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND). The initial screens are producing positive results.
 ·    University of Athens: Broad-based metabolomics analysis of over 100 cannabis genotypes including both hemp and THC-producing cannabis varieties, in combination with GBSGB’s bioassay data linking genotypes and potential disease-remediations. This project has the potential to define active ingredients from plant-derived mixtures beyond the standard cannabinoids and terpenoids. The discovery potential is huge.
 ·    The National Research Center (NRC) of Canada, Halifax, Nova Scotia: Two animal-phase studies are being performed by Dr. Lee Ellis’ group at the NRC. An animal safety and efficacy study was initiated in Q4 of 2018 for GBSGB’s Parkinson’s disease therapies, and a safety and efficacy study in animals for GBSGB’s Chronic Neuropathic Pain (NP) formulas was initiated in Q1 of 2019. 
 ·    The University of Seville: Development and functional testing of time-released and disease-targeted nanoparticles of cannabis-based complex mixtures for oral administration.
 ·    The University of Cadiz: Testing the safety and efficacy of the above-mentioned polymeric nanoparticles in rodent models.
 ·    University of Hawaii: Validating the efficacy of a complex cannabis-based mixture for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac disease in a rodent model.
 
The Company also has consulting agreements with the following subject matter experts:
 
·    Dr. Zoltan Mari, Section Head, Nevada Movement Disorders Program & Lee Pascal Parkinson's Disease Scholar at Cleveland Clinic, who will oversee the phase 0 human Parkinson’s disease trial and protocols.
 ·    Dr. Ziva Cooper, UCLA, Research Director, UCLA Cannabis Research Initiative, will design GBSGB’s human neuropathic and chronic pain trials and provide strategic guidance on clinical development of these products.  For nearly a decade, Dr. Cooper has been building on her training in preclinical models of drug dependence and developing an expertise in human laboratory studies on cannabis, cannabinoids, opioids, and cocaine while maintaining research projects in animal models of substance use. Her current research investigates the direct neurobiological effects of emerging drugs of abuse, including synthetic cannabinoids in laboratory animals and the direct physiological and behavioral effects of cannabinoids as they pertain to both their abuse potential and potential

therapeutic effects in double-blind, placebo controlled human laboratory studies. Dr. Cooper’s research is funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
 
Path to Market: Drug Development Stages and Proposed Clinical Trials
 
GBSGB has cannabis-based therapeutic products in the following stages of drug development: Discovery, Pre-Clinical, and entering the Clinical Phase. It has also licensed therapeutic products that the Company intends to develop through partners, labeled Partner Programs.
 
The completion of pre-clinical studies, clinical trials, and obtaining FDA-approvals for pharmaceutical products is traditionally a long and expensive process. However, GBSGB asserts that its drug development program, novel regulatory strategy, experienced development partners, and aggressive licensing of these products at early clinical stages can mitigate some of the risks. The Company uses a combination of in silico discovery methods and automated screening of cellular models of disease to decrease the time in Discovery prior to filing novel patent applications for disease-specific therapeutics. GBSGB’s original patent applications cover new chemical entities (“NCE”) based on complex combinations of plant-derived compounds. Its Exploratory IND/Phase 0 Program gets the Company to First-in-Man sooner than traditional programs, which reduces translational risks, and includes preliminary efficacy measures for responsible development decisions. In contrast, a traditional phased-development path would not provide any efficacy measures until Phase II. After the completion of our Phase 0 study, which compares the efficacies of multiple related cannabis-based formulations, the Company plans to advance the lead drug candidate using an adaptive trial design that is more efficient than the traditional phased-development pathway. GBSGB has entered into research contracts, partnerships, and/or joint ventures with several respected, independent contract research organizations, medical schools, universities, and other scientific researchers to increase developmental efficiencies. If and when one or more of GBSGB’s drugs, therapies or treatments are approved by the FDA, GBSGB will seek to market them under licensing arrangements with major biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.
 
GBSGB plans to use a combination of FDA-registered human clinical trials, as described in detail above, and pilot human studies in the development of its therapeutic product portfolio. Early in product development, human pilot studies that are fully-compliant with state medical cannabis programs will be used to gather early data on safety and efficacy that can later be referenced in the next phase of product development. GBSGB may be able to produce and sell the early products that prove efficacious, through licensing agreements with cannabis companies in other US states and countries that have legalized cannabis programs.  GBSGB believes that these pilot studies will provide significant value by reducing the cost of commercialization, more rapidly putting effective drugs in the hands of patients, and accelerating by years the monetization of research. GBSGB’s goal is to be the perfect partner to those companies with greater resources and experience in the marketing and distribution of medications worldwide.
 
There can be no assurance that we will ever be able to enter into any joint ventures or other arrangements with third parties to finance our drug development program or that if we are able to do so, that any of our projected therapies will ever be approved by the FDA. Even if we obtain FDA approval for a therapy, there can be no assurance that it could be successfully marketed or would not be superseded by another cannabis-based therapy produced by one or more of our competitors. It also may be anticipated that even if we enter into a joint venture development with a financially stable pharmaceutical or institutional partner, we will still be required to raise significant additional 
capital in the future to achieve the strategic goals of GBSGB. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such additional capital on reasonable terms, if at all. If GBSGB fails to achieve its goal of producing one or more cannabis-based pharmaceuticals or therapies, it would have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and business prospects.
    Description of Operations
 
Our wholly owned subsidiary GB Sciences Nevada, LLC (“GBSN”) leases a warehouse facility at 3550 W. Teco Avenue, Las Vegas Nevada. On January 4, 2017, GBSN received a State Registration Certificate (“Certificate”) for its 28,000-sq. ft. cannabis cultivation facility located in Las Vegas, NV. The receipt of the Certificate allows the Company to cultivate medical cannabis. Phase 1 of the GBSN cultivation facility opened with 200 grow lights. When all phases of construction are completed, the facility is expected to generate revenues of $10 million. 

9

Completion of all Phases of this facility is dependent upon the availability of capital to complete construction. The Company has made completion of all Phases of this facility its number one priority.
 
On October 4, 2016, we acquired a 60% interest in a Nevada Medical Marijuana Production License with an option of up to 80%. A production license enables us to convert cannabis plants into to oils and extracts that are suitable for creating medical compounds as well as consumer products. This license is critical and essential to our plan of producing cannabis-based medicines and must be integrated into our cultivation facility to ensure quality control standards and efficiency in our production of cannabis medicines. On October 23, 2017, the Company amended the existing Nevada Medical Marijuana Production License Agreement (“Amended Production License Agreement”). Per the terms of the Amended Production License Agreement, GB Sciences purchased the remaining percentage of the production license resulting in the 100% ownership of the license. GB Sciences also received 100% ownership of the cultivation license included in the original Nevada Medical Marijuana Production License Agreement. In exchange, GB Sciences made one-time payment of $500,000 and issued a Promissory Note in the amount of $700,000 payable in equal monthly payments over a three-year period commencing on January 1, 2018. On February 21, 2018, the Company received its recreational production license and began full production operations in its Las Vegas facility. 
 
On November 1, 2017, the Company entered into an Edibles Production Agreement (the “EPA”) with The Happy Confections, L.L.C. (“THCLLC”) through the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, GB Sciences Las Vegas, LLC (“GBSLV”). Dr. Andrea Small-Howard, a member of GB Science’s Board of Directors, is a Co-Managing Member of THCLLC. Under the EPA, THCLLC is to produce cannabis-infused baked goods and other edibles in GBSLV’s production facility upon approval of GBSLV’s Nevada Medical Marijuana Production License. The Company will receive a royalty of between 20% and 25% on all sales of edibles produced by THCLLC.
 Contemporaneously with the EPA, the Company entered into a Non-Revolving Credit Line Agreement and Non-Revolving Credit Line Promissory Note (together, the “THC Note” or “Note”) to advance up to $300,000 to THCLLC for the purpose of expanding THCLLC’s operations. The Note bears interest at a rate of 1.29% per annum. Beginning 90 days after the sale of its first product, THCLLC is to make repayment of its advances under the Note in an amount equal to 25% of its gross sales revenue. Such repayment is due within 10 days of the sale of any product.
 As of March 31, 2019, the Company has advanced $253,034 under the THC Note. On October 15, 2018, the Company gave notice to The Happy Confections, LLC (“THC LLC”) that Company would not provide any additional financing beyond the $300,000 Credit Line granted under the Non-Revolving Credit Line Agreement dated November 1, 2017. In this notice, the Company requested that THC LLC seek to find additional sources of financing to be able to fund the manufacture of edibles. The Company further notified THC LLC that the Company would terminate the Edibles Production Agreement and all other related agreements with THC LLC if it was unable to acquire additional funding by October 22, 2018. On October 19, 2018, the Company received a response from THC LLC that it was unable to acquire additional funding. Accordingly, the Company has terminated all of its agreements with THCLLC effective October 19, 2018 and took possession of all tangible assets owned by THCLLC on October 22, 2018, as collateral for the balance owed under the Note. These assets include kitchen and production machinery and equipment, leasehold improvements, and inventory that will be used in the Company’s production operations at the Teco Facility. 
 The Company assessed the Fair Value of the machinery and equipment received at $139,411 and has capitalized that amount in fixed assets as of March 31, 2019. All of the machinery and equipment received from THC LLC was placed in service for use in the Company’s production facility in December 2018. The Company also recorded $113,623 as other expense in its Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended March 31, 2019, which represents the remaining balance of the outstanding note receivable from THC LLC.
 
On September 18, 2017 GB Sciences finalized its agreement with Louisiana State University (“LSU”) AgCenter to be the sole operator of the LSU’s medical marijuana program. The LSU Board of Supervisors entered into a five-year agreement—that has an option to renew for two additional five-year terms—with GB Sciences.

10

The contract includes the Company’s commitment to make a minimum financial contribution to the LSU AgCenter in the amount of $3.4 million, or a 10% commission of gross receipts, in addition to annual research investments of $500,000 to the LSU AgCenter.
 The monetary contributions would be used to conduct research on plant varieties, compounds, extraction techniques and delivery methods that could generate additional revenue through discoveries that are subject to intellectual property rights, which AgCenter would retain 50% of those rights. As of March 31, 2019, GB Sciences has made payments totaling $1,500,000 toward its obligations under the agreement.
 On September 21, 2018, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, GBS Global Biopharma, Inc., in the province of Ontario, Canada with plans to license and/or transfer some of Growblox Life Sciences LLC’s intellectual property to the newly formed entity. On March 15, 2019, the Company entered into the Asset Purchase Agreement with GBS Global Biopharma, Inc., whereby all of the assets and certain liabilities held by Growblox Life Sciences, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of GB Sciences, Inc., were transferred to GBS Global Biopharma, Inc. in exchange for a promissory note in the amount of $1,435,700. The assets transferred include all intellectual property and intangible assets owned by the Company, consisting primarily of patents in process and research contracts with universities and researchers. It is anticipated that GBS Global Biopharma Inc. will pursue clinical development of the intellectual property, including clinical trials.
 
Competition
 
The medical cannabis industry is subject to intense and increasing competition. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater capital resources, facilities and infrastructure then we have, which may enable them to compete more effectively in this market. These competitors include TerraTech Corp., Cannabis Science, Inc., Peak Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cannabis-Rx, Inc. and Nemus Biosciences, Inc. In addition, the development of therapies and pharmaceutical products based on extracts from the cannabis plant is being undertaken by a number of medical and educational institutions, including the University of Mississippi, which is the only U.S. based entity authorized by the Federal government to cultivate cannabis for research. Such institutions have significantly greater financial resources and facilities than we have
Government Regulation and Federal Policy
 
Under the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”), the policies and regulations of the Federal government and its agencies are that cannabis (marijuana) is a stage 1 narcotic that is addictive and has no medical benefit. Accordingly, and a range of activities including cultivation and the personal use of cannabis is prohibited and subject to prosecution and criminal penalties. Unless and until Congress amends the CSA with respect to medical cannabis, there is a risk that the federal authorities may enforce current federal law, and we may be deemed to be engaged in producing, cultivating, or dispensing cannabis in violation of federal law, or we may be deemed to be facilitating the sale or distribution of drug paraphernalia in violation of federal law with respect to our Company’s business operations. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus indirectly and adversely affect our strategic goals, revenues and profits. The risk of strict enforcement of the CSA in light of Congressional activity, judicial holdings, and stated federal policy remains uncertain. See “Risk Factors” below. 
 The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case brought by San Diego County, California that sought to establish federal preemption over state medical cannabis laws. The preemption claim was rejected by every court that reviewed the case. The California 4th District Court of Appeals wrote in its unanimous ruling, “Congress does not have the authority to compel the states to direct their law enforcement personnel to enforce federal laws.” However, in another case, the U.S. Supreme Court held that, as long as the CSA contains prohibitions against cannabis, under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, the United States may criminalize the production and use of cannabis even where states approve its use for medical purposes.
 
In an effort to provide guidance to federal law enforcement, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has issued Guidance Regarding Cannabis Enforcement to all United States attorneys in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General David Ogden on October 19, 2009, in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on June 29, 2011 and in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013. Each memorandum provides that the DOJ is committed to the enforcement of the CSA, but, the DOJ is also committed to using its limited 

11

investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent and rational way.
 
The August 29, 2013 memorandum provides updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement in light of state laws legalizing medical and recreational cannabis possession in small amounts.
 
The memorandum sets forth certain enforcement priorities that are important to the federal government:
 
•

Distribution of cannabis to children; 
 •

Revenue from the sale of cannabis going to criminals; 
 •

Diversion of medical cannabis from states where it is legal to states where it is not; 
 •

Using state authorized cannabis activity as a pretext of another illegal drug activity; 
 •

Preventing violence in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis; 
 •

Preventing drugged driving; 
 •

Growing cannabis on federal property; and 
 •

Preventing possession or use of cannabis on federal property. 
 
On January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions revoked the Ogden Memo and the Cole Memos.
 
The DOJ has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of cannabis for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address cannabis activity. In the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical cannabis and recreational cannabis in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to our business and our revenue and profits. Furthermore, H.R. 83, enacted by Congress on December 16, 2014, provides that none of the funds made available to the DOJ pursuant to the 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act may be used to prevent certain states, including Nevada and California, from implementing their own laws that authorized the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical cannabis. 
 
In contrast to federal policy, there are currently thirty-three states and the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulations that recognize, in one form or another, legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. Many other states are considering similar legislation.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2019, we employed fifty-six employees consisting of management and support staff.
