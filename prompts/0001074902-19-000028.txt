LCNB CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Primary Market Area
The Bank considers its primary market area to consist of counties where it has a physical presence and neighboring counties, which includes Southwestern and South Central Ohio. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had:

• | 35 offices, including a main office in Warren County, Ohio and branch offices in Warren, Butler, Clinton, Clermont, Fayette, Franklin, Hamilton, Montgomery, Preble, and Ross Counties, Ohio,


• | a loan production office in Franklin County, Ohio,


• | an Operations Center in Warren County, Ohio,


• | and 38 ATMs.

Competition
The Bank faces strong competition both in making loans and attracting deposits.  The deregulation of the banking industry and the wide spread enactment of state laws that permit multi-bank holding companies as well as the availability of nationwide interstate banking has created a highly competitive environment for financial services providers. The Bank competes with other national and state banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, mortgage brokerage firms, realty companies with captive mortgage brokerage firms, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking companies, and other financial intermediaries operating in its market and elsewhere, many of whom have substantially larger financial and managerial resources.
The Bank seeks to minimize the competitive effect of other financial institutions through a community banking approach that emphasizes direct customer access to the Bank's CEO and other officers in an environment conducive to friendly, informed, and courteous personal services.  Management believes that the Bank is well positioned to compete successfully in its primary market area.  Competition among financial institutions is based upon interest rates offered on deposit accounts, interest rates charged on loans and other credit and service charges, the quality and scope of the services rendered, the convenience of the banking facilities, and, in the case of loans to commercial borrowers, relative lending limits.
The ability to access and use technology is an increasingly competitive factor in the financial services industry. Technology relating to the delivery of financial services, the security and privacy of customer information, and the processing of information is evolving rapidly. LCNB must continually make technology investments to remain competitive in the financial services industry.
Management believes the commitment of the Bank to personal service, innovation, and involvement in the communities and primary market areas it serves, as well as its commitment to quality community banking service, are factors that contribute to its competitive advantage.
Supervision and Regulation
LCNB Corp., as a financial holding company, is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "Act"), and is subject to the supervision and examination of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board").  
The Bank is subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act.  The Bank is subject to primary supervision, regulation and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC"). The Bank is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC.  
LCNB Corp. and the Bank are subject to an extensive array of banking laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of the Bank's customers and depositors.  These laws and regulations govern such areas as permissible activities, loans and investments, and rates of interest that can be charged on loans and reserves.  LCNB Corp. and the Bank also are subject to general U.S. federal laws and regulations and to the laws and regulations of the State of Ohio.  Set forth below are brief descriptions of selected laws and regulations applicable to LCNB and the Bank.
The Financial Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 ("FIRREA") provides that a holding company and its controlled insured depository institutions are liable for any loss incurred by the FDIC in connection with the default of any FDIC assisted transaction involving an affiliated insured bank or savings association.

LCNB CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") substantially revised the bank regulatory and funding provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and several other federal banking statutes.  Among its many reforms, FDICIA, as amended:

1. | Required regulatory agencies to take "prompt corrective action" with financial institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements;


2. | Established five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized; 


3. | Imposed significant restrictions on the operations of a financial institution that is not rated well-capitalized or adequately capitalized;


4. | Prohibited a depository institution from making any capital distributions, including payments of dividends or paying any management fee to its holding company, if the institution would be undercapitalized as a result;


5. | Implemented a risk-based premium system;


6. | Required an audit committee to be comprised of outside directors;


7. | Required a financial institution with more than $500 million in total assets to issue annual, audited financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and


8. | Required a financial institution with more than $1 billion in total assets to document, evaluate, and report on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control system and required an independent public accountant to attest to management's assertions concerning the bank's internal control system.

The members of an audit committee for banks with more than $1 billion in total assets must be independent of management.  FDICIA does not relieve financial institutions that are public companies, such as LCNB, from internal control reporting and attestation requirements or audit committee independence requirements prescribed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (see below).
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which amended the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and other banking related laws, was signed into law on November 12, 1999.  The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act repealed certain sections of the Glass-Steagall Act and substantially eliminated the barriers separating the banking, insurance, and securities industries.  Effective March 11, 2000, qualifying bank holding companies could elect to become financial holding companies.  Financial holding companies have expanded investment powers, including affiliating with securities and insurance firms and engaging in other activities that are "financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity," as defined in the act, or "complementary to a financial activity."
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX") became effective on July 30, 2002.  The purpose of SOX is to strengthen accounting oversight and corporate accountability by enhancing disclosure requirements, increasing accounting and auditor regulation, creating new federal crimes, and increasing penalties for existing federal crimes.  SOX directly impacts publicly traded companies, certified public accounting firms auditing public companies, attorneys who work for public companies or have public companies as clients, brokerage firms, investment bankers, and financial analysts who work for brokerage firms or investment bankers.  Key provisions affecting LCNB include: 

1. | Certification of financial reports by the chief executive officer ("CEO") and the chief financial officer ("CFO"), who are responsible for designing and monitoring internal controls to ensure that material information relating to the issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to the certifying officers by others within the company;


2. | Inclusion of an internal control report in annual reports that include management's assessment of the effectiveness of a company's internal control over financial reporting and a report by the company's independent registered public accounting firm attesting to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting;


3. | Accelerated reporting of stock trades on Form 4 by directors and executive officers;


4. | Disgorgement requirements of incentive pay or stock-based compensation profits received within twelve months of the release of financial statements if the company is later required to restate those financial statements due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement that resulted from misconduct;


5. | Disclosure in a company's periodic reports stating if it has adopted a code of ethics for its CFO and principal accounting officer or controller and, if such code of ethics has been implemented, immediate disclosure of any change in or waiver of the code of ethics;


6. | Disclosure in a company's periodic reports stating if at least one member of the audit committee is a "financial expert," as that term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"); and


7. | Implementation of new duties and responsibilities for a company's audit committee, including independence requirements, the direct responsibility to appoint the outside auditing firm and to provide oversight of the auditing firm's work, and a requirement to establish procedures for the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints from a company's employees regarding questionable accounting, internal control, or auditing matters.

In addition, the SEC adopted final rules on September 5, 2002, which rules were amended in December, 2005, requiring accelerated filing of quarterly and annual reports.  Under the amended rules, “large accelerated filers” includes companies with a market capitalization of $700 million or more and “accelerated filers” includes companies with a market capitalization between $75 million and $700 million. Large accelerated filers are required to file their annual reports within 60 days of year-end and quarterly reports within 40 days. Accelerated filers are required to file their annual and quarterly reports within 75 days and 40 days, respectively.  These new accelerated filing deadlines were effective for fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2005.  Under the amended rules, LCNB is considered an accelerated filer.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 and the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Conforming Amendments Act of 2005 (collectively, the “Deposit Insurance Reform Acts”) were both signed into law during February, 2006.  The provisions of the Deposit Insurance Reform Acts included:

1. | Merging the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund into a new fund called the Deposit Insurance Fund, effective March 31, 2006;


2. | Increasing insurance coverage for retirement accounts from $100,000 to $250,000, effective April 1, 2006; and


3. | Eliminating a 1.25% hard target Designated Reserve Ratio, as defined, and giving the FDIC discretion to set the Designated Reserve Ratio within a range of 1.15% to 1.50% for any given year.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) became effective on July 21, 2010.  The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions that specifically affect financial institutions and other entities providing financial services and other corporate governance and compensation provisions that will affect most public companies.
The Dodd-Frank Act established a new independent regulatory body within the Federal Reserve System known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”).  The CFPB has assumed responsibility for most consumer protection laws and has broad authority, with certain exceptions, to regulate financial products offered by banks and non-banks.  The CFPB has authority to supervise, examine, and take enforcement actions with respect to depository institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, non-bank mortgage industry participants, and other CFPB-designated non-bank providers of consumer financial services.  The primary regulator for depository institutions with $10 billion or less in assets will continue to have primary examination and enforcement authority for these institutions.  The regulations enforced, however, will be the regulations written by the CFPB.
The Dodd-Frank Act directs federal bank regulators to develop new capital requirements for holding companies and depository institutions that address activities that pose risk to the financial system, such as significant activities in higher risk areas, or concentrations in assets whose reported values are based on models.
The Dodd-Frank Act permanently raised the FDIC maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000.  In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act places a floor on the FDIC’s reserve ratio at 1.35% of estimated insured deposits or the comparable percentage of the assessment base.
General corporate governance provisions included in the Dodd-Frank Act include expanding executive compensation disclosures to be included in the annual proxy statement, requiring non-binding shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation at annual meetings, enhancing independence requirements for compensation committee members and any advisers used by the compensation committee, and requiring the adoption of certain compensation policies including the recovery of executive compensation in the event of a financial statement restatement.
The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act ("Economic Growth Act") was signed into law on May 24, 2018. It scales back certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and provides other regulatory relief. Certain provisions affecting LCNB include:

1. | Reduced reporting requirements on call reports for the first and third quarters of a reporting year for banks with less than $5 billion in total consolidated assets;


2. | Extended regulatory examination cycles from twelve to eighteen months for banks with less than $3 billion in total consolidated assets;


3. | Requiring federal financial institution regulators to classify all qualifying investment-grade, liquid and readily-marketable municipal securities as level 2B liquid assets under the liquidity coverage ratio rule;


4. | Exempting reciprocal deposits from treatment as brokered deposits under the FDIC's brokered deposits rule, up to the lesser of $5 billion or 20% of bank liabilities; and

-8-

LCNB CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES


5. | Simplifying regulatory capital requirements by providing that banks with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets that meet a to-be-developed community bank leverage ratio of tangible equity to average assets will be deemed to be in compliance with capital and leverage requirements.

Noncompliance with laws and regulations by bank holding companies and banks can lead to monetary penalties and/or an increased level of supervision or a combination of these two items.  Management is not aware of any current significant instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations and does not anticipate any problems maintaining compliance on a prospective basis.  Recent regulatory inspections and examinations of LCNB and the Bank have not disclosed any significant instances of noncompliance.
The earnings and growth of LCNB are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Board.  Its policies influence the amount of bank loans and deposits and the interest rates charged and paid thereon and thus have an effect on earnings.  The nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the future business and earnings of LCNB and the Bank cannot be predicted.
A substantial portion of LCNB's cash revenues is derived from dividends paid by the Bank.  These dividends are subject to various legal and regulatory restrictions.  Generally, dividends are limited to the aggregate of current year retained net income, as defined, plus the retained net income of the two prior years.  In addition, dividend payments may not reduce capital levels below minimum regulatory guidelines.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, LCNB employed 325 full-time equivalent employees. LCNB is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement.  Management considers its relationship with its employees to be very good.  Employee benefit programs are considered by management to be competitive with benefit programs provided by other financial institutions and major employers within LCNB’s market area.
Availability of Financial Information
LCNB files unaudited quarterly financial reports on Form 10-Q, annual financial reports on Form 10-K, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports are filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with the SEC.  Copies of these reports are available free of charge in the shareholder information section of the Bank's website, www.lcnb.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed or furnished to the SEC, or by writing to:

Many commercial loan officers are authorized to accept loan applications and have various, designated lending limits for the approval of loans.  A loan application for an amount outside a particular officer's lending limit needs to be approved by an officer with a lending limit sufficient for that loan.  Loans secured by residential or commercial real estate require the approval of two individuals with appropriate lending authority:  Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Lending Officer, Chief Credit Officer, Senior Vice President ("SVP") of Commercial Lending, SVP of Mortgage Lending, SVP of Consumer Lending, Assistant Vice President of Secondary Market Lending, or other board-designated lending officers.  Board approval is required on any loan with critical policy exceptions or that will exceed 50% of the Bank's legal lending limit, rounded down to the previous $100,000, in aggregate credit to any one borrower or entity, as defined by the OCC in 12 C.F.R § 32.2(b).
Interest rates charged by the Bank vary with degree of risk, type of loan, amount, complexity, repricing frequency and other relevant factors associated with the loan.
