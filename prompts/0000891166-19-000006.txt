ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
Universal Insurance Holdings, Inc. (“UVE,” and together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, “we,” “our,” “us,” or “the Company”) is a holding company offering property and casualty (“P&C”) insurance and value-added insurance services. We develop, market and underwrite insurance products for consumers predominantly in the personal residential homeowners lines of business and perform substantially all other insurance-related services for our primary insurance entities, including risk management, claims management, and distribution. Our primary insurance entities, Universal Property & Casualty Insurance Company (“UPCIC”) and American Platinum Property and Casualty Insurance Company (“APPCIC” and together with UPCIC, the “Insurance Entities”), offer insurance products through both our appointed independent agent network and our online distribution channels across 17 states (primarily in Florida), with licenses to write insurance in an additional three states. The Insurance Entities seek to produce an underwriting profit over the long term (defined as earned premium less losses, loss adjustment expense, policy acquisition costs and other operating costs); maintain a strong balance sheet to prepare for years in which the Insurance Entities are not able to achieve an underwriting profit; and generate investment income on assets exceeding short-term operating needs.
Business Strategy
UVE’s strategic focus is on creating a best-in-class experience for our customers, which is supported by our experience of more than 20 years providing protection solutions. Our business strategy leverages our differentiated capabilities to support the Insurance Entities across all aspects of the insurance value chain to provide our customers with a streamlined experience. We continue to evaluate ways in which we can improve the customer experience, provide disciplined underwriting, maintain a strong balance sheet backed by our reinsurance programs and geographic diversification, and maximize earnings stability through inversely correlated or complementary high-quality earnings streams. In 2019 we rebranded certain of our subsidiaries to better serve our Insurance Entities, distinctly identify our capabilities, and position us for continued growth in the future. We have made substantial efforts in recent years to improve our claims operation, including reductions in our claim resolution time and an intensified effort to collect subrogation for the benefit of the Insurance Entities and their policyholders.
Products and Services
Insurance Products 
UPCIC (which accounts for the vast majority of our Insurance Entities’ business) currently offers the following types of personal residential insurance: homeowners, renters/tenants, condo unit owners, and dwelling/fire. UPCIC also offers allied lines, coverage for other structures, and personal property, liability and personal articles coverages. APPCIC currently writes the same lines of insurance as UPCIC, but for properties valued in excess of $1 million. In addition, APPCIC writes, to a much lesser degree, commercial residential multi-peril insurance.
Risk Management
Our subsidiary, Evolution Risk Advisors (“ERA”, formerly Universal Risk Advisors, Inc.), is the managing general agent (“MGA”) for the Insurance Entities. In this capacity, ERA advises on actuarial issues, oversees distribution, administers claims payments, performs policy administration and underwriting, and assists with reinsurance negotiations. ERA’s underwriting service evaluates insurance risk and exposures on an individual and portfolio basis and assists the Insurance Entities with pricing risks. All underwriting is performed utilizing our state-approved underwriting manuals as the basis of our rate-making and risk assessment. ERA collects fees from the Insurance Entitles for the services it provides, as well as certain policy fees from insureds. Our subsidiary, Wicklow Inspection Corporation (“WIC”, formerly known as Universal Inspection Corporation), supports ERA by conducting inspections as part of our underwriting process.
The Insurance Entities rely heavily on reinsurance to limit potential exposure to catastrophic events, and in most years our single largest cost is the expense for our reinsurance coverage . In conjunction with ERA, our fully-licensed reinsurance intermediary, Blue Atlantic Reinsurance Corporation (“BARC”), partners with third-party reinsurance brokers to place and manage its reinsurance program for the Insurance Entities. BARC receives commission revenue, net of third-party co-broker fees, from reinsurers in connection with these services.

Claims Management
Our subsidiary, Alder Adjusting Corporation (“AAC”, formerly known as Universal Adjusting Corporation), manages our claims processing and adjustment functions from claim inception to conclusion for our Insurance Entities, which we believe allows us to increase efficiency and provide a high level of customer service. AAC’s Fast Track initiative (“Fast Track”) has expedited the claims settlement process to close certain types of claims in as little as 24 hours through analysis and on-site field adjusting. In addition to our in-house claims operation, we assign a small percentage of field inspections to third-party adjusters to enable us to continue to provide high quality and timely service following a catastrophe, such as a hurricane in coastal states, and during any other period of unusually high claim volume. Through our continuous improvement and operational excellence initiatives, we continue to evaluate ways in which we can improve the customer’s claims experience on a rolling basis. AAC’s data intelligence allows the Insurance Entities, ERA and our reinsurance partners to identify trends and refine the underwriting process and guidelines to adequately price risk. Our claims management operations provide cost-effective solutions in servicing claims for the Insurance Entities and generates additional fee income from adjusting claims ceded to reinsurers.
We have substantially grown our claims litigation team to more effectively and efficiently protect our rights in litigation, including through subrogation. Subrogation is the act of pursuing a third party that caused an insurance loss to the insured in order to recover from the third party the amount the insurance carrier paid to the insured. 
Distribution
We market and sell our products primarily through our network of over 9,300 licensed independent agents (4,300 in Florida). In addition to our independent agent force, we offer policies through our direct-to-consumer online distribution platforms. Our strong relationships with our independent agents and their relationships with their customers are critical to our ability to identify, attract and retain profitable business. We actively participate in the recruitment and training of our independent agents and provide each agency with training sessions on topics such as underwriting guidelines and submitting claims. We also engage a third-party market representative to assist in ongoing training and recruitment initiatives in all of the states in which we write business.
We utilize an attractive commission-based compensation plan as an incentive for independent agents to place business with us. We also strive to provide excellent service to our independent agents and brokers, which has yielded long-standing partnerships with our independent agents, a number of which have relationships that span more than a decade) that benefit the Company in our target markets through hard and soft market cycles. Our internal staff and specialists provide support to our independent agents by providing access to our in-house technology systems to assist with the delivery of service to our policyholders. This arrangement creates a collaborative environment between the Company and our independent agents on continuous improvement initiatives and allows our independent agents to provide quotes within minutes. Our technology systems have evolved into a highly valued tool that enables agents to quickly understand the status of a policy and assist their clients with policy-related questions.
In addition to distributing our products through our independent agent network, we also utilize our differentiated direct-to-consumer online distribution platforms. Universal DirectSM was launched in 2016 to enable homeowners to directly purchase, pay for and bind homeowners policies online without the need to directly interface with any intermediaries. Universal DirectSM was offered in all 17 states in which we do business as of December 31, 2018. 
Lastly, we recently introduced a multi-purpose online distribution platform in Florida, CloveredSM, which enables consumers to “Prepare, Protect, and Recover” from the unexpected with educational resources that we plan to eventually supplement with the ability to purchase a policy online. 
Financing
Our subsidiary, Atlas Premium Finance Company (“Atlas”), generates fee income by offering premium financing to consumers of insurance products in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina. 
Real Estate
The Grand Palm Development Group (“Grand Palm”) is UVE’s real estate development entity, which we have created to diversify UVE’s investment portfolio. Grand Palm developed and operates a 16-unit condominium development in Tequesta, Florida, and is developing a high-end five-unit condominium project on Singer Island, Florida. Grand Palm also evaluates undeveloped parcels of land for investment opportunities on an ongoing basis.

Investments
Excess funds from the Insurance Entities and UVE are invested with third-party investment advisers. The Investment Committee of our Board of Directors (the “Board of Directors” or the “Board”) oversees these advisers and reports overall investment results to our Board, at least on a quarterly basis. The investment activities of the Insurance Entities are subject to regulation and supervision by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (“FLOIR”). See below under “—Government Regulation.” The Insurance Entities may only make investments that are consistent with regulatory guidelines, and our investment policies for the Insurance Entities accordingly limit the amount of investments in, among other things, non-investment grade fixed maturity securities (including high-yield bonds), preferred stock and common stock, and prohibit purchasing securities on margin. The primary objectives of our investment portfolio are the preservation of capital and providing adequate liquidity for claims payments and other cash needs. Our investment portfolio’s secondary investment objective is to provide a sufficient total rate of return with an emphasis on investment income. We focus on relatively short-term investments, with approximately 14.9% of the fair value of our portfolio with contractual maturities due in one year or less, and another 48.2% due after one year but before five years. While we seek to appropriately limit the size and scope of investments in our portfolio, UVE is not similarly restricted by statutory investment guidelines governing insurance companies. Therefore, the investments made by UVE may differ from those made by the Insurance Entities.
See “Part II, Item 8—Note 3 (Investments)” and “Part I, Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Investments” for more information about our investments. 
Markets and Competition
Markets
We sell insurance products in the following 17 states: Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia. We have additional licenses to write on an admitted basis in Illinois, Iowa and West Virginia. During 2018, our total direct premiums written was 85.1% in Florida and 14.9% in other states. The Florida market as a whole tends to consistently be a top-three personal residential homeowners insurance market in the United States based on direct premium written, due in large part to pricing levels that seek to address the hurricane risk exposure in the state (from June 1 through November 30), population, and property ownership, which consequentially leads to an increase in real estate development activity. 
We have historically experienced higher direct premiums written just prior to the second quarter of our fiscal year and lower direct premiums written approaching the fourth quarter, as a result of consumer behaviors in the Florida residential real estate market and the hurricane season affecting coastal states. See “Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Our financial condition and operating results and the financial condition and operating results of our Insurance Entities may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty insurance business.”
Hurricanes or other catastrophic events can significantly impact earnings for insurance carriers in Florida and other coastal states, depending on the strength of their reinsurance programs and partners and the level of net retention to which the carriers subscribe. This volatility and market dislocation was evident in Florida following Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons (during which eight hurricanes made landfall in coastal states). Given the potential for significant personal property damage, the availability of homeowners insurance and claims servicing are vitally important to coastal states’ residents. The benefits of UVE’s reinsurance strategy in 2018 and the specific programs are further discussed below and in “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.”
Competition
The market for homeowners insurance is highly competitive. We compete with numerous private and publicly traded participants from Florida as well as large national carriers, some of which have subsidiaries with brand awareness that is distinctly separate from their parent brand and may have greater capital resources. See “Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Our future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in a highly competitive insurance industry.”
The personal residential homeowners insurance industry is strictly regulated. As a result, it is difficult for insurance companies to differentiate their products, which creates low barriers to entry (other than regulatory capital and other requirements) and results in a highly competitive market based largely on price and the customer experience. The nature, size and experience of our primary competitors varies across the states in which we do business.
Price
Pricing has generally been defined by “hard” and “soft” cyclical markets. Hard markets are those in which policy premiums are increasing (as a result of periods of capital shortages resulting in a lack of insurance availability, relatively low levels of price competition, and more selective underwriting of risks). Soft markets are those in which pricing has stabilized or is decreasing (as a result of periods of relatively high levels of price competition and less restrictive underwriting standards). Many factors influence the pricing environment, including, but not limited to, catastrophic events, loss experience, GDP growth/contraction, inflation, interest rates, primary insurance and reinsurance capacity and availability, share-of-wallet competition, litigious matters including assignment of benefits, technological advancements in distribution, underwriting, claims management and overall operational efficiencies, and the risk appetite of competitors. 
Our successful track record in writing homeowners insurance in catastrophe-exposed areas has enabled us to develop sophisticated risk selection and pricing techniques that strive to identify desirable risks and accurately price the risk of loss while allowing us to be competitive in our target markets. This risk selection and pricing approach allows us to offer competitive products in areas that have a high demand for property insurance. 
The premiums we charge are based on rates specific to individual risks and locations and are generally subject to regulatory review and approval before they are implemented. We periodically submit our rate revisions to regulators as required by law or as we deem necessary or appropriate for our business. The premiums we charge to policyholders are affected by legislative enactments and administrative rules, including state-mandated programs in Florida requiring residential property insurance companies like us to provide premium discounts when policyholders verify that insured properties have certain construction features or windstorm loss reduction features.
Customer Experience
Drivers of the customer experience include reliability and value, financial strength and ease-of-use. We strive to provide excellent reliability and value through the strength of our distribution networks, high-quality service to our policyholders and independent agents, our claims handling ability and product features tailored to our markets. 
Our Insurance Entities, UPCIC and APPCIC, are both currently rated “A” (“Exceptional”) by Demotech, Inc. (“Demotech”), which is a rating agency specializing in evaluating the financial stability of insurers. In addition, our combined capital surplus was approximately $307.4 million at December 31, 2018.
The current trends in the industry in regards to ease-of-use suggest an increased focus on utilizing technology in the distribution channel, enabling technology and machine learning in the underwriting domain, as well as utilizing actionable intelligence in claims management services. We believe there is significant opportunity to improve the customer experience across all consumer touch points. We are committed to delivering solutions to enable the consumer to prepare, protect, recover and learn about insurance. We believe effective integration and knowledge transfer to the consumer will result in improved customer satisfaction and encourage consumer retention. In addition, UVE’s strong operating teams and streamlined in-house value-added services drive competitive rates and value to the end users. Our monthly weighted average renewal retention rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 88.4%.
Reinsurance
Reinsurance enables UVE’s Insurance Entities to limit potential exposures to catastrophic events. Reinsurance contracts are typically classified as treaty or facultative contracts. Treaty reinsurance provides coverage for all or a portion of a specified group or class of risks ceded by the primary insurer, while facultative reinsurance provides coverage for specific individual risks. Within each classification, reinsurance can be further classified as quota-share or excess. Quota-share reinsurance is where the primary insurer and the reinsurer share proportionally or pro-rata in the direct premiums and losses of the insurer. Excess reinsurance indemnifies the direct insurer or reinsurer for all or a portion of the loss in excess of an agreed upon amount or retention.
Developing and implementing our reinsurance strategy to adequately protect our balance sheet and Insurance Entities in the event of one or more catastrophes while maintaining efficient reinsurance costs has been a key strategic priority for UVE. For 2018, UVE utilized excess of loss reinsurance. The benefits of the reinsurance strategy in 2018 and the specific programs are further discussed in “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.” In recent years, the property and casualty insurance market has experienced a substantial increase in the availability of property catastrophe reinsurance resulting from the increased supply of capital from non-traditional reinsurance providers, including private capital and hedge funds. This increased capital supply has helped to mitigate upward pressure on reinsurance pricing following the recent significant catastrophic activity in Florida and elsewhere around the world.
In order to limit our potential exposure to catastrophic events, we purchase significant reinsurance from third-party reinsurers and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (the “FHCF”). The FLOIR requires us, like all insurance companies doing business in Florida, to have a certain amount of capital and reinsurance coverage in order to cover losses upon the occurrence of a single catastrophic event and a series of catastrophic events occurring in the same hurricane season. Our 2018-2019 reinsurance program meets and provides reinsurance in excess of the FLOIR’s requirements, which are based on, among other things, the probable maximum loss that we would incur from an individual catastrophic event estimated to occur once in every 100 years based on our portfolio of insured risks and a series of stress test catastrophe loss scenarios based on past historical events. In respect to the single catastrophic event, the nature, severity and location of the event giving rise to such a probable maximum loss differs for each insurer depending on the insurer’s portfolio of insured risks, including, among other things, the geographic concentration of insured value within the insurer’s portfolio. Accordingly, a particular catastrophic event could be a one-in-100 year loss event for one insurance company while having a greater or lesser probability of occurrence for another insurance company.
We believe our retention under the reinsurance program is appropriate and structured to protect our customers. We test the sufficiency of our reinsurance program by subjecting our personal residential exposures to statistical testing using a third-party hurricane model, RMS RiskLink v17.0 (Build 1825). This model combines simulations of the natural occurrence patterns and characteristics of hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes and other catastrophes with information on property values, construction types and occupancy classes. The model outputs provide information concerning the potential for large losses before they occur, so companies can prepare for their financial impact. Furthermore, as part of our operational excellence initiatives, we continually look to enable new technology to refine our data intelligence on catastrophe risk modeling.
Seasonality
The nature of our business tends to be seasonal during the year, reflecting consumer behaviors in connection with the Florida residential real estate market and the hurricane season. The amount of direct premiums written tends to increase just prior to the second quarter and tends to decrease approaching the fourth quarter.
Government Regulation
We are subject to extensive regulation in the markets we serve, primarily at the state level, and will become subject to the regulations of additional states in which we seek to conduct business in the future. These regulations cover all aspects of our business and are generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, as opposed to the interests of shareholders. Such regulations relate to authorized lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, allowable rates and forms, investment parameters, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, market conduct, maximum amount allowable for premium financing service charges and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of our business. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Insurance Industry—We are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth and profitability.”
Examinations
As part of their regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments conduct periodic financial examinations of the books, records, accounts and operations of insurance companies that are authorized to transact business in their states. In general, insurance regulatory authorities defer to the insurance regulatory authority in the state in which an insurer is domiciled; however, insurance regulatory authorities in any state in which we operate may conduct examinations at their discretion. Under Florida law, the periodic financial examinations generally occur every five years, although the FLOIR or other states may conduct limited or full scope reviews more frequently. The financial examination reports are typically available to the public at the conclusion of the examination process. In addition, state insurance regulatory authorities may make inquiries, conduct investigations and administer market conduct examinations with respect to insurers’ compliance with applicable insurance laws and regulations. These inquiries or examinations may address, among other things, the form and content of disclosures to consumers, advertising, sales practices, claims practices and complaint handling. The reports arising from insurance authorities’ examination processes typically are available to the public at the conclusion of the examinations.
Insurance Holding Company Laws
UVE, as the ultimate parent company of the Insurance Entities, is subject to the insurance holding company laws of the State of Florida. These laws, among other things, (i) require us to file periodic information with the FLOIR, including information concerning our capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations, (ii) regulate certain transactions between us and our affiliates, including the amount of dividends and other distributions, the terms of surplus notes and amounts that our affiliates can charge the Insurance Entities for services such as policy administration and claims administration, and (iii) restrict the ability of any one person to acquire certain levels of our voting securities without prior regulatory approval.
The Florida Insurance Code prohibits any person from acquiring control of the Insurance Entities or their holding companies unless that person has filed a notification with specified information with the FLOIR and has obtained the FLOIR’s prior approval. Under the Florida Insurance Code, acquiring 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered an acquisition of control of the insurance company, although such presumption may be rebutted. Some state insurance laws require prior notification to state insurance regulators of an acquisition of control of a non-domiciliary insurance company doing business in that state. 
Insurance holding company regulations also govern the amount any affiliate of the holding company may charge insurance affiliates for services (e.g., claims adjustment, administration, management fees and commissions). Further, insurance holding company regulations may also require prior approval of insurance regulators for amendments to or terminations of certain affiliate agreements.
Florida holding company laws also require certain insurers annually to submit an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment, or ORSA, summary report to the FLOIR each year beginning in 2017, summarizing the insurer’s evaluation of the adequacy of its risk management framework. In December 2017, the Company completed and filed its first ORSA summary report with FLOIR. The Company filed its most recent ORSA summary report in December 2018.
Capital Requirements
State insurance authorities monitor insurance companies’ solvency and capital requirements using various statutory requirements and industry ratios. Initially, states require minimum capital levels based on the lines of business written by a company and set requirements regarding the ongoing amount and composition of capital. State regulators also require the deposit of state deposits in each state. See “Part II—Item 8—Note 5 (Insurance Operations)” for more information about state deposits. As a company grows, additional capital measures and standards may be implemented by a regulator. Regulatory authorities use a risk-based capital (“RBC”) model published by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) to monitor and regulate the solvency of licensed property and casualty insurance companies. These guidelines measure three major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers: (i) underwriting risks, which encompass the risk of adverse loss developments and inadequate pricing, (ii) declines in asset values arising from credit risk and (iii) other business risks. Most states, including Florida, have enacted the NAIC guidelines as statutory requirements, and insurers having less surplus than required by applicable statutes and ratios are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending on the level of capital inadequacy. As of December 31, 2018, the Insurance Entities’ RBC ratios exceed applicable statutory requirements. See “Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Insurance Industry—The amount of statutory capital and surplus that each of the Insurance Entities has and the amount of statutory capital and surplus it must hold can vary and are sensitive to a number of factors outside our control, including market conditions and the regulatory environment and rules.”
Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions
As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, UVE relies on dividend payments from its subsidiaries as its principal sources of cash to pay dividends, purchase UVE common shares and meet its obligations. Dividends paid by our subsidiaries other than the Insurance Entities are not subject to the statutory restrictions set forth in the Florida Insurance Code. However, insurance holding company regulations govern the amount that any affiliate within the holding company system may charge any of the Insurance Entities for services. See “Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Insurance Industry—We are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth.” Dividends paid to our shareholders in 2018 were paid from the earnings of UVE and its subsidiaries. State insurance laws govern the payment of dividends by insurance companies. The maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by Florida insurance companies without prior approval of the Commissioner of the FLOIR is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus. The maximum dividend that may be paid by the Insurance Entities to UVE without prior approval is limited to the lesser of statutory net income from operations of the preceding calendar year or statutory unassigned surplus as of the preceding year end. 
Underwriting and Marketing Restrictions
During the past several years, various regulatory and legislative bodies in Florida and in other states have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations to address the cyclical nature of the insurance industry, catastrophic events and insurance capacity and pricing. These regulations (i) restrict certain policy non-renewals or cancellations and require advance notice on certain policy non-renewals and (ii) from a practical standpoint, limit or delay rate changes for a specified period during or after a catastrophe event. Most states, including Florida, also have insurance laws requiring that rate schedules and other information be filed and approved by the insurance regulatory authority in advance of being implemented. The insurance regulatory authority may disapprove a rate filing if it finds that the proposed rates would be inadequate, excessive or unfairly discriminatory. Rates, which are not necessarily uniform for all insurers, vary by class of business, hazard covered and size of risk.
Most states, including Florida, require licensure or insurance regulatory authority approval prior to the marketing of new insurance products. Typically, licensure review is comprehensive and includes a review of a company’s business plan, solvency, reinsurance, character and experience of its officers and directors, rates, forms and other financial and non-financial aspects of a company. The insurance regulatory authorities may prohibit entry into a new market by not granting a license or by withholding approval for an insurer to write new lines of business. The Company is subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight, regulations and the payment of fees, premium taxes and assessments in order to maintain its licenses which includes periodic reporting to regulators and regulatory exams to assure the Company maintains compliance with statutory requirements.
Privacy and Information Security Regulation
Federal and state laws and regulations require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of non-public personal information and to notify customers and other individuals about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of customer information and their practices relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. In late 2017, the NAIC issued a model law on cybersecurity, which is leading to adoption of the same or similar provisions in the states where we do business. In addition, some states have adopted, and others might adopt, cybersecurity regulations that differ from proposed model acts or from the laws enacted in other states. Federal and state lawmakers and regulatory bodies may be expected to consider additional or more detailed regulation regarding these subjects and the privacy and security of non-public personal information. See “Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Breaches of our information systems or denial of service on our website could have an adverse impact on our business and reputation.”
Statutory Insurance Organizations
Many states in which the Insurance Entities operate have statutorily-mandated insurance organizations or other insurance mechanisms in which the Insurance Entities are required to participate or to potentially pay assessments. Each state has insurance guaranty association laws providing for the payment of policyholders’ claims when insurance companies doing business in that state become insolvent. These guaranty associations typically are funded by assessments on insurance companies transacting business in the respective states. When the Insurance Entities are subject to assessments they generally must remit the assessed amounts to the guaranty associations. The Insurance Entities subsequently seek to recover the assessed amounts through recoupments from policyholders. In the event the Insurance Entities are not able to fully recoup the amounts of those assessments, such unrecovered amounts can be credited against future assessments, or the remaining receivable may be written off. While we cannot predict the amount or timing of future guaranty association assessments, we believe that any such assessments will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. See “Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Insurance Industry—Regulations limiting rate changes and requiring us to participate in loss sharing or assessments may decrease our profitability.”
Several states, including Florida, have insurance mechanisms that provide insurance to consumers who are not otherwise able to obtain coverage in the private insurance market. The largest such insurance mechanism is Florida’s Citizens Property Insurance Corporation. The degree to which these state-authorized insurance mechanisms compete with private insurers such as the Insurance Entities varies over time depending on market and public policy considerations beyond our control. In addition, these insurance mechanisms often rely on assessments of insurers to cover any operating shortfalls. 
FHCF is a state-sponsored entity in Florida that provides a layer of reinsurance protection at a price that is typically lower than what would otherwise be available in the third-party reinsurance market. The purpose of the FHCF is to protect and advance the state’s interest in maintaining insurance capacity in Florida by providing reimbursements to insurers for a portion of their catastrophe hurricane losses. Most property and casualty insurers operating in Florida, including the Insurance Entities, are subject to assessment if the FHCF lacks sufficient claims-paying resources to meet its reimbursement obligations to insurers. FHCF assessments are added to policyholders’ premiums and are collected and remitted by the Insurance Entities. In addition, all homeowner insurance companies that write business in Florida, including the Insurance Entities, are required to obtain a form of reinsurance through the FHCF. Currently, the FHCF provides $17 billion of aggregate capacity annually to its participating insurers, which may be adjusted by statute from time to time.
Employees
