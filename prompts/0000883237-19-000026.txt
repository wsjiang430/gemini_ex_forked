Item 1. | Business.

Organization
Virtus Investment Partners, Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, commenced operations on November 1, 1995 through a reverse merger of the investment management subsidiary of Phoenix Life Insurance Company ("Phoenix") with Duff & Phelps Corporation. The Company was a majority-owned subsidiary of Phoenix from 1995 to 2001 and a wholly owned subsidiary from 2001 until 2008. On December 31, 2008, the Company became an independent publicly traded company as a result of Phoenix's distribution of 100% of Virtus common stock to Phoenix stockholders in a spin-off transaction.
Our Business
 We provide investment management and related services to individuals and institutions. We use a multi-manager, multi-style approach, offering investment strategies from affiliated managers, each having its own distinct investment style, autonomous investment process and individual brand. By offering a broad array of products, we believe we can appeal to a greater number of investors and have offerings across market cycles and through changes in investor preferences. Our earnings are primarily driven by asset-based fees charged for services relating to these products including investment management, fund administration, distribution and shareholder services. 
We offer investment strategies for individual and institutional investors in different product structures and through multiple distribution channels. Our investment strategies are available in a diverse range of styles and disciplines, managed by a collection of differentiated investment managers. We have offerings in various asset classes (domestic and international equity, fixed income and alternative), market capitalizations (large, mid and small), styles (growth, core and value) and investment approaches (fundamental, quantitative and thematic). Our retail products include U.S. 1940 Act mutual funds, Undertaking for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities ("UCITS" or "offshore funds" and collectively with U.S. 1940 Act mutual funds, "open-end funds") exchange traded funds ("ETFs"), closed-end funds (collectively, "funds") and retail separate accounts. Our institutional products include a variety of equity and fixed income strategies for corporations, multi-employer retirement funds, public employee retirement systems, foundations and endowments. We also provide subadvisory services to other investment advisors.
Our Investment Managers
We provide investment management services through our investment managers who are registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Advisers Act"). The investment managers are responsible for portfolio management activities for our retail and institutional products operating under advisory or subadvisory agreements. We provide our affiliated managers with distribution, operational and administrative support, thereby allowing each manager to focus primarily on investment management. We also engage select unaffiliated managers for certain of our open-end funds and ETFs. We monitor our managersâ€™ services by assessing their performance, style and consistency and the discipline with which they apply their investment process.

(1) Includes ETFs and Liquidity strategies
Investment Management Fees
We provide investment management services pursuant to investment management agreements through our affiliated investment advisers (each an "Adviser"). With respect to our funds, the Adviser provides overall investment management services, pursuant to agreements with the funds that must be approved annually by the fundâ€™s board of directors and that may be terminated without penalty, or automatically in certain situations, such as a "change in control" of the Adviser. We earn fees based on each fundâ€™s average daily or weekly net assets with most fee schedules providing for rate declines or "breakpoints" as asset levels increase to certain thresholds. For funds managed by subadvisers, the agreement provides that the subadviser manage the day-to-day investment management of the fundâ€™s portfolio and receive a management fee from the Adviser based on the percentage of average daily net assets in the funds they subadvise or a percentage of the Adviserâ€™s management fee. Each fund bears all expenses associated with its operations. In some cases, to the extent total fund expenses exceed a specified percentage of a fundâ€™s average net assets, the Adviser has agreed to reimburse the funds for such excess expenses. For certain of our exchange traded funds managed by unaffiliated subadvisers, the subadviser has agreed to pay the fundâ€™s operating expenses in excess of the specified percentage of fund average assets.
For retail separate accounts and institutional accounts, fees are negotiated and based primarily on asset size, portfolio complexity and individual client requests. Fees for structured finance products, for which we act as the collateral manager, consist of senior, subordinated and, in certain instances, incentive management fees. Senior and subordinated management fees are calculated at a contractual fee rate applied against the end of the preceding quarter par value of the total collateral being managed with subordinated fees being recognized only after certain portfolio criteria are met. Incentive fees on certain of our CLOs are typically a percentage of the excess cash flows available to holders of the subordinated notes, above a threshold level internal rate of return. 
5

Administration Fees
We provide various administrative fund services to our open-end funds and certain of our closed-end funds. We earn fees based on each fundâ€™s average daily or weekly net assets. These services include: record keeping, preparing and filing documents required to comply with securities laws, legal administration and compliance services, customer service, supervision of the activities of the fundsâ€™ service providers, tax services and treasury services as well as providing office space, equipment and personnel that may be necessary for managing and administering the business affairs of the funds.
Shareholder Service Fees
We provide shareholder services to our open-end mutual funds. We earn fees based on each fundâ€™s average daily net assets. Shareholder services include maintaining shareholder accounts, processing shareholder transactions, preparing filings and performing necessary reporting, among other things. We engage third-party service providers to perform certain aspects of the shareholder services.
Our Distribution Services
We distribute our open-end funds and ETFs through financial intermediaries. We have broad access in the retail market, with distribution partners that include national and regional broker-dealers and independent financial advisory firms. Our sales efforts are supported by regional sales professionals, a national account relationship group, and a separate team for retirement and insurance products.
Our retail separate accounts are distributed through financial intermediaries and directly by teams at our affiliated managers. Our institutional services are marketed through relationships with consultants as well as directly to clients. We target key market segments, including foundations and endowments, corporate, public and private pension plans, and provide subadvisory services to other investment advisors.
Our Broker-Dealer Services
We operate two broker-dealers that are registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"). They serve as principal underwriters and distributors of our open-end mutual funds and ETFs. Our broker-dealers are subject to the Securities and Exchange Commissionâ€™s ("SEC") net capital rule designed to enforce minimum standards regarding the general financial condition and liquidity of broker-dealers.

Open-end mutual fund shares and UCITS fund shares are distributed by VP Distributors, LLC ("VPD") under sales agreements with unaffiliated financial intermediaries. VPD also markets advisory services to sponsors of retail separate accounts. ETF Distributors, LLC ("ETFD") serves as the principal underwriter and distributor of our ETFs. 
Our Competition
We face significant competition from a wide variety of financial institutions, including other investment management companies, as well as from proprietary products offered by our distribution partners such as banks, broker-dealers and financial planning firms. Competition in our businesses is based on several factors including investment performance, fees charged, access to distribution channels and service to financial advisers and their clients. Our competitors, many of which are larger than us, often offer similar products and use similar distribution sources and may also offer less expensive products, have greater access to key distribution channels, and have greater resources than we do.
Our Regulatory Matters
We are subject to regulation by the SEC, FINRA and other federal and state agencies and self-regulatory organizations. Each affiliated manager and unaffiliated subadviser is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act. Each open-end mutual fund, closed-end fund and ETF is registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act"). Our UCITs are subject to regulation by the Central Bank of Ireland ("CBI"), and the funds and each investment manager and sub-investment manager to the UCITs are registered with the CBI. 
The financial services industry is highly regulated, and failure to comply with related laws and regulations can result in the revocation of registrations, the imposition of censures or fines, and the suspension or expulsion of a firm and/or its employees from the industry. All of our U.S.-domiciled open-end mutual funds are currently available-for-sale and are qualified in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our UCITS are sold through financial intermediaries to investors

Our officers, directors and employees may, from time to time, own securities that are also held by one or more of our funds. Our internal policies with respect to personal investments are established pursuant to the provisions of the Investment Company Act and/or the Investment Advisers Act. Employees, officers and directors who, in the function of their responsibilities to us, meet the requirements of the Investment Company Act, Investment Advisers Act and/or FINRA regulations must disclose personal securities holdings and trading activity. Employees, officers and directors with investment discretion or access to investment decisions are subject to additional restrictions with respect to the pre-clearance of the purchase or sale of securities over which they have investment discretion or beneficial interest. Other restrictions are imposed upon supervised persons with respect to personal transactions in securities that are held, recently sold, or contemplated for purchase by our mutual funds. All supervised persons are required to report holdings and transactions on an annual and quarterly basis pursuant to the provisions of the Investment Company Act and Investment Advisers Act. In addition, certain transactions are restricted so as to avoid the possibility of improper use of information relating to the management of client accounts.
