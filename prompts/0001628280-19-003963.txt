Item 1. Business
Mitcham Industries, Inc. (“MII” and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, "Mitcham," the “Company”, we”, “us” and “our”), a Texas corporation, was incorporated in 1987. We provide technology to the oceanographic, hydrographic, defense, seismic and maritime security industries. Headquartered in Huntsville, Texas, Mitcham has a global presence with operating locations in the United States, Canada, Singapore, Hungary, Colombia and the United Kingdom. We operate in two business segments, Marine Technology Products and Equipment Leasing. During August 2018, the Company completed the sale of Mitcham Seismic Eurasia LLC (“MSE”) in Ufa, Russia. As of January 31, 2019, the Company has classified our Australian subsidiary, Seismic Asia Pacific Pty Ltd. (“SAP”), as held for sale. Refer to Note 21 - "Assets Held for Sale" of our consolidated financial statements for additional details.
Our worldwide Marine Technology Products segment includes (a) Seamap Pte Ltd, Seamap USA, LLC, Seamap (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd and Seamap (UK) Ltd, collectively “Seamap” which designs, manufactures and sells specialized marine seismic equipment, (b) Klein Marine Systems, Inc. (“Klein”), which designs, manufactures and sells high performance side scan sonar and water-side security systems and (c) the equipment sales activities of SAP. In February 2018, Seamap significantly expanded its offerings with the acquisition from a third party of intellectual property related to marine seismic sensors and streamer technology.
We acquired Klein effective December 31, 2015. Klein has over 48 years of experience with the development and manufacture of high performance side scan sonar systems. Our side scan sonar systems are deployed by navies, port authorities, other governmental organizations, marine survey companies and universities worldwide. Klein operates from a single facility in Salem, New Hampshire.
Our Equipment Leasing segment is primarily engaged in the leasing of seismic equipment to companies in the oil and gas industry throughout the world. We also sell new and used seismic equipment from time to time. We conduct our leasing business through MII, Mitcham Canada ULC (“MCL”), Mitcham Europe Ltd. (“MEL”), Mitcham Marine Leasing Pte. Ltd. (“MML”), our branch in Colombia and, prior to August 2018, MSE. We believe we are the largest independent provider of exploration equipment to the seismic industry.
Historically, our business was primarily focused on our Equipment Leasing segment, specifically the short-term rental of land seismic equipment used in the exploration for oil and gas. Over the past several years, however, there have been a number of developments that have had an adverse effect on that business. These developments include the following:

• | Uncertainty in prices for oil and natural gas and the resulting decline in exploration activity by oil and gas companies.


• | An excess of rental equipment or equipment capacity in the seismic industry.


• | Increased competition for the sale or rental of seismic equipment, particularly land seismic equipment.


• | Decreased pricing for the purchase or rental of seismic equipment.


• | Financial difficulties encountered by many of our customers in the seismic industry.

Accordingly, we have implemented a strategy to emphasize our Marine Technology Products segment and to revise our approach to our Equipment Leasing segment. This strategy is based on the following vision for Mitcham:

• | We will become known as a provider of innovative technology and products to the oceanographic, hydrographic, seismic, defense and maritime security industries.


• | We will leverage our various technologies, products and services to create new products and address new markets. We will seek out opportunities to add new technologies and products.


• | We will retain Mitcham’s position as a leading provider of equipment to the seismic industry, but do so in innovative ways by working together with our customers and suppliers. This revised business model will enable us to manage the financial risk to our shareholders while continuing to serve the needs of our customers.


• | We will create an organization that facilitates cross-fertilization of our existing technologies and market presence. We will, wherever possible, leverage our engineering, sales, operations, manufacturing and administrative resources. Cooperation among business units and sharing of resources will be a primary focus.

For additional information about our business segments, including related financial information, see Note 16 - "Segment Reporting" to our consolidated financial statements and Item 7 - “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K. 
 Our equipment is utilized in a variety of geographic regions throughout the world, which are described under “ Customers, Sales, Backlog and Marketing.” 
Marine Technology Products Segment –
Seamap designs, manufactures and sells a broad range of products for the oceanographic, hydrographic and marine seismic industries. Seamap’s primary products include the GunLink™ seismic source acquisition and control systems, commonly referred to as “energy source controllers", which provide operators of marine seismic surveys more precise control of energy sources, and the BuoyLink™ RGPS (“relative global positioning system”) tracking system, which is used to provide precise positioning of seismic sources and streamers. In March 2018, Seamap introduced the SeaLink™ product line of marine sensors and solid streamer systems. These new products are based on technology that was acquired in February 2018.
Klein primarily designs, manufactures and sells advanced side scan sonar systems and waterside security systems for the oceanographic, hydrographic, defense and maritime security industries on a world-wide basis. Klein’s family of side scan sonar products are used in a variety of applications including hydrographic surveys, naval mine counter measure operations, search and recovery operations, ocean bottom profiling and other underwater object detection operations. 
SAP sells equipment, consumables, systems integration, engineering hardware and software maintenance support services to companies in the seismic, hydrographic, oceanographic, environmental and defense industries throughout Southeast Asia and Australia. SAP is a distributor for a number of manufacturers of products, including Klein and occasionally Seamap. As of January 31, 2019, SAP is classified as held for sale. See Business and Operations - Marine Technology Products Segment for a discussion of the factors surrounding this determination. See Note 21 - "Assets Held for Sale" to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impact of this classification.
Seamap and Klein have overlapping customer bases and it is not uncommon for a marine survey vessel to be equipped with products from both Seamap and Klein. We expect that in the future we will have opportunities to package products from Seamap and Klein in response to requests from customers.
The technologies underlying the products of Seamap and Klein are similar, as are the engineering disciplines and challenges. We anticipate significant engineering collaboration between Seamap and Klein and plan to jointly develop new products.
The manufacturing processes of Seamap and Klein are similar. While we expect to maintain separate manufacturing operations, we do believe there will be opportunities for collaboration. Such collaboration might include using common suppliers, outsourcing specific functions between the operations and common support and repair activities. During fiscal 2019 we began cross-training Seamap employees to repair Klein equipment and expect to start preforming repairs in Singapore for Klein’s customers located in the (1) Pacific Rim / (2) Asia Pacific Region / (3) Far East in fiscal 2020.
For information regarding our operating results and total assets by segment, see Note 16 - "Segment Reporting" to our consolidated financial statements. 
Equipment Leasing Segment –
We own a variety of technologically advanced equipment acquired from the leading seismic manufacturers. Our lease pool consists of many types of equipment used in seismic data acquisition, including various electronic components of land, transition zone and marine seismic data acquisition systems, geophones and cables, peripheral equipment, survey and other equipment. We have relationships with a variety of different manufacturers of seismic equipment. Under certain of the relationships we acquire equipment at a significant discount and then share resulting rental revenues with the manufacturer of the equipment. We believe these type arrangements share risks and benefits among all parties and mitigate our exposure.
We lease our equipment on a short-term basis, generally for two to six months, to seismic contractors who need equipment for a particular seismic survey. Short-term leasing agreements enable our customers to achieve operating and capital investment efficiencies. A typical seismic crew uses a wide variety of equipment to perform seismic data acquisition surveys. Our customers may lease a small amount of equipment to expand an existing crew’s capabilities or a complete seismic data acquisition system to equip an entire crew. Demand for short-term seismic equipment leases is affected by many factors, including: (1) the highly variable size and technological demands of individual seismic surveys, (2) seasonal weather patterns and sporadic demand for seismic surveys in certain regions, (3) the term of the lease and (4) the cost of seismic equipment. We believe these factors allow seismic contractors to use short-term seismic equipment leasing as a cost-effective alternative to purchasing additional equipment. Our equipment lease rates vary according to an item’s expected useful life, utilization, acquisition cost and the term of the lease.

Index to Financial Statements

As the seismic equipment market has declined in recent periods we have reduced our lease pool of equipment by limiting purchases of additional equipment and by selling equipment that we have deemed to be excess. We expect our investment in lease pool equipment in future periods to remain materially lower than it has been historically. We may in the future sell additional lease pool equipment. Proceeds from any such sales could be used to reinvest in other lease pool equipment or could be redeployed in other parts of our business.
During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 (“fiscal 2019”) we determined to eliminate our legal and physical presence in Russia. Accordingly, in August 2018, we sold MSE. See Business and Operations - Equipment Leasing Segment for a discussion of the factors surrounding this determination. See Note 22 - "Sale of MSE", of our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the sale of MSE.
Seismic Technology
Data generated from digital seismic recording systems and peripheral equipment is used in a variety of marine and land applications, including hydrographic surveys, civil engineering operations, mining surveys and in the search for and development of oil and gas reserves. In addition, marine seismic sensors can be used in a number of military and security applications, such as anti-submarine warfare. Users of seismic technology include marine and land seismic contractors, marine survey operators, research institutes and governmental entities.
Principles of seismic technology are the same for land and for marine environments. However, the operational issues and therefore the equipment utilized are quite different. Essentially all of the products in our Marine Technology Products segment are for use in marine environments. The majority of our Equipment Leasing segment involves land based operations.
Oil and gas companies have begun to utilize time lapse (“4-D”) seismic techniques for producing oil and gas fields. 4-D surveys involve periodically acquiring seismic data over the same area. These techniques allow the oil and gas company to monitor and analyze the production from existing properties and optimize production and reserve recovery.
Seismic surveys utilizing 2-D, 3-D or 4-D techniques require essentially the same equipment. The manner in which the equipment is deployed and the resulting data analyzed differs, however. Accordingly, our equipment can generally be utilized in 2-D, 3-D and 4-D seismic surveys.
Side Scan Sonar Technology
A side scan sonar (sound navigation and ranging) system is a specialized system used for detecting objects underwater by transmitting sound energy to the right and left of the host vehicle and processing the return signals (echoes) that have bounced off the seafloor or other objects into two dimensional, photo like, images of the ocean bottom. Basic side scan sonar systems do not provide depth information nor do they penetrate the seafloor bottom. However, side scan sonar models are available that incorporate bathymetry elements (the study of underwater depth of lake or ocean floors). These systems do provide bathymetric (depth) information that is co-registered with side scan data. Sub-seafloor bottom profiling can also be used in concert with side scan sonar technology to look below the seabed into the stratum layers.
Users of side scan sonar technology include governmental and military organizations, port and harbor authorities, fire and police departments, offshore oil and gas operators and contractors, universities and scientific organizations, mining companies, marine survey companies and marine salvage operators. Applications that utilize side scan sonar technology include the following:

• | Preplanned shipping route surveys


• | Mine counter measures and mine-like object detection


• | Environmental assessments


• | Hydrographic surveys


• | Waterside security


• | Dredging operations


• | Pipeline and cable surveys


• | Bridge scour monitoring


• | Search and recovery


• | Underwater construction surveys


• | Pipeline and cable route surveys


• | Marine research


• | Archaeology surveys


• | Marine life and habitat monitoring

• | Mining surveys


• | Treasure hunting


• | Marine salvage operations

Business and Operations
Marine Technology Products Segment –
Through our Marine Technology Products segment, we develop, manufacture and sell a range of proprietary products for the oceanographic, hydrographic, seismic, defense and maritime security industries. Certain technology we have developed internally. Other technology has been acquired through the purchase of business or specific assets from others. We expect to continue to internally develop new technology or enhancements to our existing technology. However, we may also gain access to new technology or products through acquisition, joint venture arrangements or licensing agreements.
Seamap’s primary products include: (1) the GunLink seismic source acquisition and control systems, which are designed to provide operators of marine seismic surveys more precise monitoring and control of energy sources; (2) the BuoyLink RGPS tracking system, which is used to provide precise positioning of marine seismic energy sources and streamers; (3) Digishot™ energy source controller; and (4) Sleeve Gun energy sources. Seamap’s other products include streamer weight collars, depth transducers, pressure transducers, air control valves and source array systems. In addition to selling complete products, Seamap provides spare and replacement parts related to the products it sells. Seamap also provides certain services related to its products. These include repair services, engineering services, training, field service operations and umbilical terminations. 
In March 2018, Seamap introduced the SeaLink product line of marine sensors and solid streamer systems. These products are based on intellectual property that Seamap acquired in February 2018 from the bankrupt estate of Hydroscience Technology, Inc. (the "Hydroscience Acquisition"). See Note 4 - "Acquisition of Assets" of our consolidated financial statements for additional details. We believe these new products significantly expand the product offerings of Seamap and increase our addressable market. We further believe that certain aspects of this technology are complementary to Klein’s product offerings.
Marine seismic contractors and geotechnical and hydrographic survey companies are generally Seamap’s customers. These contractors operate vessels used to conduct seismic surveys in shallow and deep water marine environments. Seamap’s customers operate in all areas of the world.
We maintain a Seamap facility in the United Kingdom which includes engineering, training, sales and field service operations. Our Seamap facility in Singapore includes engineering, assembly, sales, repair and field service operations. In connection with the introduction of the SeaLink products, we have established a production facility in Malaysia to provide for the manufacture and repair of the streamer components of this system. The facility in Malaysia is in relative close proximity to our Singapore facility.
Klein is a supplier of side scan sonar equipment and waterside security and surveillance systems. Products are marketed to governmental and commercial customers through an internal sales organization and a network of distributors and representatives around the world. Sales, engineering, production and administrative operations are performed from Klein’s facility in Salem, New Hampshire.
Klein offers an extensive product line of side scan sonar systems and related products. The product line includes multi-beam and single-beam side scan sonar systems with varying levels of capability. These products are utilized in a number of applications including portable search and recovery, shallow and deep water surveys, naval mine warfare, underwater object detection and bathymetry. These products can be deployed from vessels of varying size, including autonomous underwater vehicles and autonomous surface vehicles. 
Klein’s HarborGuard® Integrated Waterside Surveillance and Security System (the “HarborGuard system”) combines radar, video and other surveillance technology to provide security for a variety of waterside installations. The HarborGuard system is currently used by a number of military, commercial and local government agencies for offshore platform, port, harbor and bridge security and surveillance applications. 
Components for our products are sourced from a variety of suppliers located in Asia, Europe and the United States. Products are generally assembled, tested and shipped from our facilities in Singapore, Malaysia and New Hampshire.
SAP sells equipment, consumables, systems integration, engineering hardware and software maintenance support services to the seismic, hydrographic, oceanographic, environmental and defense industries throughout Southeast Asia and Australia. SAP is a manufacturer’s representative for an array of equipment lines, including Klein and Seamap. During fiscal 2018 we began to evaluate the contribution of SAP to our overall business objectives, particularly as it related to the sale of Klein products in China. We determined that a more direct relationship between Klein and customers in China, one not involving SAP, would be more beneficial. Accordingly, we have amended our relationships with our local representatives in China such that SAP is no longer a party to those activities. In light of this change, we further evaluated the remaining business operations of SAP, i.e. the representation of other OEM’s in the Pacific Rim. We determined that this business model was not consistent with our overall objectives and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 implemented a plan to dispose of 
5

Index to Financial Statements

SAP. We expect the sale of SAP to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2020. See Note 21 - "Assets Held for Sale" to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding this transaction.
Equipment Leasing Segment –
We own a comprehensive lease pool of seismic equipment for short-term rental to our customers, who are primarily seismic data acquisition contractors and oil field service providers (in the case of downhole equipment). We lease this equipment multiple times until the earlier of the end of its useful life or its sale. Our customers generally lease seismic equipment to supplement their own inventory of recording channels and related equipment.
We maintain a master lease agreement with each of our customers that outlines the general terms and conditions of our leases. Individual transactions are generally documented through an “equipment lease schedule” that incorporates the terms and conditions of the master lease agreement. Individual leases generally have terms of two to six months and are typically renewable following the initial rental period. Our equipment lease rates vary according to an item’s expected useful life, utilization, initial cost, the term of the lease and general market conditions. We provide maintenance of our leased equipment during the lease term for malfunctions due to failure of material and parts and provide replacement equipment, as necessary. In addition, we occasionally provide field technical support services when requested by our customers. The customer is responsible for the cost of repairing equipment damages, other than normal wear and tear. In the case of lost or destroyed equipment, the customer is required to reimburse us for the replacement cost of the equipment, at a price specified in the lease agreement, or to provide acceptable replacement equipment. The customer is also normally responsible for the costs of shipping the equipment from and to one of our facilities and is responsible for all taxes, other than income taxes, related to the lease of the equipment. The customer is required to obtain and maintain insurance for the replacement value of the equipment and a specified minimum amount of general liability insurance, depending on the location of the operations. It is our general practice to lease our seismic equipment on a monthly or daily rate, depending on the circumstances.
Upon completion of a lease, the equipment must generally be returned to one of our facilities where it is inspected, tested, repaired, if necessary, and staged for another project. While the customer is normally responsible for the costs of shipping and repairs, during this time the equipment is not available for lease to another customer. Therefore, managing this process and the utilization of the equipment is an important aspect of our operations. 
We maintain facilities for the inspection, testing and repair of land seismic equipment in Huntsville, Texas; Calgary, Alberta; Bogota, Colombia; Budapest, Hungary and Singapore. We maintain marine equipment inspection, testing and repair facilities in Huntsville, Texas and Singapore. We believe that this broad network of support facilities helps us effectively utilize our equipment and reduce costs associated with these operations. However, due to the decline in our leasing business in recent periods, we have significantly reduced the scope of our operations in some locations. During fiscal 2019 we eliminated all land leasing activity in SAP, located in Brisbane, Australia, significantly reduced the scope of our operations in Bogota and began reducing the scale of our operation in Calgary.
Lease Pool Equipment Sales. On occasion, we sell used equipment from our lease pool, normally in response to specific customer demand, declining demand for rental of specific equipment or to redeploy capital. Used equipment sold from our lease pool can have a wide range of gross margins depending upon the amount of depreciation that has been recorded on the item. When used equipment is sold from our lease pool, the net book value plus any cost associated with the sale is recorded to cost of goods sold. Sales of our lease pool equipment typically occur as opportunities arise and do not have a significant seasonal aspect. Under the terms of our lease agreements, customers are responsible for lost or destroyed equipment. Charges for such lost equipment are at prices specified in the particular lease agreement and are reflected as lease pool equipment sales in the accompanying financial statements.
Key Agreements
Seamap has an agreement with Petroleum Geo-Services ASA (“PGS”) for the manufacture and sale of a customized and proprietary marine energy source controller, (“PGS SourceLink”) that is based on our GunLink 4000 product. In December 2018, we gave notice to PGS that we would allow the agreement to expire by its own terms effective June 2019.
Klein has a number of agreements for the distribution or representation of its products and Seamap has a limited number of similar agreements. These agreements are generally cancellable upon a notice period of from one to three months.
Customers, Sales, Backlog and Marketing
During our fiscal 2019, no customers accounted for greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues. During our fiscal year ending January 31, 2018 (“fiscal 2018”), two customers accounted for approximately 27% of our consolidated revenues and during our fiscal year ending January 31, 2017 (“fiscal 2017”), two customers accounted for approximately 24% of our consolidated revenues. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues during these periods. See Item 1A-“Risk Factors.” Due to the nature of our sales, the significance of any one customer can vary significantly from year to year.

Competition
Marine Technology Products –
We compete with a number of other manufacturers of marine seismic, hydrographic and oceanographic equipment. Some of these competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than our own. We generally compete for sales of equipment on the basis of (1) technical capability, (2) reliability, (3) price, (4) delivery terms and (5) service.
Equipment Leasing –
Our major competitors include the seismic equipment manufacturers who sell equipment on financed terms, offer leases with purchase options and offer short term rentals of their products. In addition, some seismic contractors might have excess equipment available for lease from time to time. We face lesser competition from several companies that engage in seismic equipment leasing, but this competition has historically been fragmented and our competitors have not had as extensive a seismic equipment lease pool nor as wide geographic presence as we do. We compete for seismic equipment leases on the basis of (1) price, (2) delivery terms, (3) availability of desired equipment and (4) location of equipment. We believe that our infrastructure and broad geographic presence also provide a major competitive advantage by contributing to our operational efficiencies.
We compete in the used equipment sales market with a broad range of seismic equipment owners, including seismic data acquisition contractors, who use and eventually dispose of seismic equipment. Some of these competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than our own.
Suppliers
We obtain parts, components and services from a number of suppliers to our manufacturing operation. These suppliers are located in various geographic locations. No critical items are obtained on a sole-source basis.
We have several suppliers of seismic equipment for our lease pool including Sercel subsidiaries of Compagnie Generale de Geophysique (“Sercel”) and Geospace Technologies Corporation (“Geospace”), Inova Geophysical ,Inc. (“Inova”) and Langfang Dynamic Technologies Co. Limited (“DTCC”). We have agreements with Inova and DTCC whereby we have acquired certain equipment at significantly discounted prices and have agreed to provide them additional consideration based on the subsequent rental of the equipment to third parties. For additional information regarding the risk associated with our suppliers, see Item 1A - “Risk Factors.”
Employees
As of January 31, 2019, we employed approximately 193 people full-time, none of whom were represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
Intellectual Property
The products designed, manufactured and sold by our Marine Technology Products segment utilize significant intellectual property that we have developed, purchased or have licensed from others. Our internally developed intellectual property consists of product designs and trade secrets. In connection with the acquisition of the Digishot and Sleeve Gun product lines from ION in May 2014, we acquired certain United States and foreign patents related to energy source controllers and other technology. We believe these acquired intellectual property rights will allow us to incorporate certain design features and functionality in future versions of our GunLink product line. We believe the pertinent patents to have a valid term through at least 2023. In connection with the Hydroscience Acquisition, we acquired certain United States and foreign patents and patent applications related to hydrophone technology.
In connection with the acquisition of Klein in December 2015, we acquired certain intellectual property consisting primarily of product designs and trade secrets. During fiscal 2019, we filed a provisional patent related to the application of certain side scan sonar technology. In March 2019, we filed a patent application encompassing the claims of the provisional patent. 
We own intellectual property relating to the design and manufacture of Heli-pickers. This intellectual property includes United States, Canadian, Australian and United Kingdom patents.
For additional information regarding the risks associated with our intellectual property, see Item 1A-“Risk Factors.”
Environmental Regulation
We are subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations, both in the United States and other countries, pertaining to worker safety and health, the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, chemicals and other materials used in our manufacturing processes or otherwise generated from our operations, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment and natural resources. Compliance with these laws and regulations in the United States at the federal, state and local levels may, among other things, 
8

Index to Financial Statements

require the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, impose specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection, result in capital expenditures to limit or prevent emissions, discharges and other releases, obligate us to use more stringent precautions for disposal of certain wastes, or incur substantial costs to remediate releases of chemicals or materials to the environment. Foreign countries in which we conduct operations may also have analogous controls that regulate our environmental and worker safety and health-related activities, which controls may impose additional, or more stringent requirements. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations, the occurrence of restrictions, delays, or cancellations in the permitting or performance of projects, and the issuance of injunctive relief in affected areas. We may be subject to strict, joint and several liability as well as natural resource damages resulting from spills or releases of chemicals or other regulated materials and wastes at our facilities or at offsite locations. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by spills or releases that may affect them. As a result of such actions, we could be required to remove previously disposed wastes, remediate environmental contamination, and undertake measures to prevent future contamination, the costs of which could be significant.
In addition, certain regulations in the United States, including the U.S. Department of Transportation Hazardous Material regulations, and in foreign jurisdictions address the manner in which certain hazardous materials and storage batteries may be transported. These regulations may limit our ability, and that of our customers, to transport equipment necessary for seismic operations, particularly by air. These limitations may significantly increase the time and cost required to transport such equipment.
The trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus any such new laws and regulations, changes in such existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of such legal requirements, or increased governmental enforcement that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Furthermore, the adoption of laws or implementing regulations with regard to hydraulic fracturing or climate-change that have the effect of lowering the demand for carbon-based fuels or decreasing the performance of oil or natural gas exploration or production activities by energy companies could reduce demand for our products and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, the implementation of new or more restrictive regulatory initiatives in response to significant spills by oil and natural gas operators, such as occurred following the Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010, may restrict, delay or decrease the pace of exploration or production activities, whether in the United States or in foreign countries, which may result in a similar decrease in demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business.
We are also subject to federal, state and foreign worker safety and health laws and regulations. These laws and regulations obligate us to organize and/or disclose information about certain chemicals and materials used or produced in our operations and to provide this information to employees, state and legal governmental authorities and citizens. Historically, our environmental worker safety and health compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. For additional information regarding the risk associated with environmental matters, see Item 1A - “Risk Factors.”
