ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

INTRODUCTION 
 BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust (the Trust), a grantor trust, was created as a Delaware business trust by the BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust Agreement dated as of February 28, 1989 (the Trust Agreement) among The Standard Oil Company (Standard Oil), BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. (BP Alaska), The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly named The Bank of New York) (BNYM), as trustee, and F. James Hutchinson, co-trustee (BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware, formerly named The Bank of New York (Delaware), successor co-trustee). At the time of the execution of the Trust, BP Alaska and Standard Oil were wholly-owned subsidiaries of BP p.l.c. (BP). 
 On August 27, 2019, BP announced that it had agreed to sell BP Alaska and its other assets and operations in Alaska for total consideration of $5.6 billion to Hilcorp Alaska, LLC and its affiliates, which are affiliates of Houston-based Hilcorp Energy Company (collectively Hilcorp). On June 30, 2020, Hilcorp completed its acquisition of BPs entire upstream business in Alaska, including BPs interest in BP Alaska, which owned all of BPs upstream oil and gas interest in Alaska (including oil and gas leases in the Prudhoe Bay field), and on December 18, 2020, an affiliate of Hilcorp completed its acquisition of BPs midstream business in Alaska. On July 1, 2020, BP Alaska, a Delaware corporation, converted to a Delaware limited liability company and changed its name to Hilcorp North Slope, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hilcorp Alaska, LLC. Hilcorp and its affiliates employ approximately 1,500 full-time employees in Alaska. Under the terms of the Trust Agreement, HNS is the successor to BP Alaska. For purposes of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, HNS means (i) at all times prior to June 30, 2020, BP Alaska, and (ii) at all times after and including June 30, 2020, Hilcorp North Slope, LLC (formerly known as BP Alaska). 
 On December 15, 2010, BNYM resigned as trustee under the Trust Agreement and BP Alaska appointed The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (the Trust Company) to succeed BNYM as trustee. The Trust Company accepted its appointment and assumed all rights, titles, duties, powers and authority formerly held and exercised by BNYM under the Trust Agreement. The corporate trust office of the Trust Company (which we refer to hereafter as the Trustee) at which the affairs of the Trust are administered is located at 601 Travis Street, Floor 16, Houston, Texas, 77002 and its telephone number at that address is (713) 483-6020.
The Trust maintains an Internet website at https://bpt.q4web.com/home/default.aspx. The Trusts Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as any amendments to those reports, are available free of charge through the Trusts website as soon as reasonably practicable after it files them with, or furnishes them to, the SEC. The SEC maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy statements and other information regarding SEC registrants, including the Trust. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, the Trusts website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and you should not consider information on the Trusts website to be part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Trust has included its website address as an inactive textual reference only. 
 The information in this report relating to the Prudhoe Bay Unit, the calculation of Royalty Payments and certain other matters has been furnished to the Trustee by HNS, and the Trustee is entitled to rely on the accuracy of such information in accordance with the Trust Agreement.

 THE TRUST 
 Trust Property 
 The property of the Trust consists of an overriding royalty interest (the Royalty Interest) and cash and cash equivalents held by the Trustee from time to time. The Royalty Interest entitles the Trust to a royalty on 16.4246% of the lesser of (i) the first 90,000 barrels (the term barrel is a unit of measure of petroleum liquids equal to 42 United States gallons corrected to 60 degrees Fahrenheit temperature) of the actual average daily net production of crude oil and condensate per quarter from the working interest of BP Alaska (as predecessor to HNS) as of February 28, 1989, in the Prudhoe Bay oil field located on the North Slope in Alaska or (ii) the actual average daily net production of crude oil and condensate per quarter from that working interest. The Prudhoe Bay field is one of four contiguous North Slope oil fields that are operated by HNS and are known collectively as the Prudhoe Bay Unit. The Royalty Interest was conveyed to the Trust by an Overriding Royalty Conveyance dated February 27, 1989, from BP Alaska (as predecessor to HNS) to Standard Oil and a Trust Conveyance dated February 28, 1989, from Standard Oil to the Trust. Copies of the Overriding Royalty Conveyance and the Trust Conveyance are filed with the SEC as exhibits to this report. The Overriding Royalty Conveyance and the Trust Conveyance are referred to collectively in this report as the Conveyance. 
 The Royalty Interest is a non-operating interest in minerals. The Trust does not have the right to take oil and gas in kind, nor does it have any right to take over operations or to share in any operating decision with respect to HNSs working interest in the Prudhoe Bay field. HNS is not obligated to continue to operate any well or maintain or attempt to maintain in force any portion of its working interest when, in its reasonable and prudent business judgment, the well or interest ceases to produce or is not capable of producing oil or gas in paying quantities. 
 Human Capital 
 The Trust has no employees. All administrative functions of the Trust are performed by the Trustee, in accordance with the terms of the Trust. 
 
2 


 Duties and Powers of the Trustee 
 The duties of the Trustee are specified in the Trust Agreement and the laws of the State of Delaware. BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware has been appointed co-trustee in order to satisfy the Delaware Statutory Trust Acts requirement that the Trust have at least one trustee resident in, or which has its principal place of business in, Delaware. However, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. alone is able to exercise the rights and powers granted to the Trustee in the Trust Agreement. 
 The basic function of the Trustee is to collect income from the Royalty Interest, to perform all necessary filing and reporting obligations of the Trust, to pay all fees, expenses, costs, charges and obligations of the Trust from the Trusts income and assets, and to pay available cash to Unit holders after satisfaction of all of the Trusts liabilities (including, without limitation, Administrative Expenses as defined below), and establishing or increasing reserves for the future liabilities of the Trust. Because of the passive nature of the Trusts assets and the restrictions on the power of the Trustee to incur obligations, the only liabilities that the Trust normally incurs in the conduct of its operations and those in connection with the eventual termination of the Trust include, without limitation, the Trustees fees and administrative fees, expenses, charges and costs, including accounting, engineering, legal, financial advisory, and other professional fees (Administrative Expenses). 
 The Trust Agreement grants the Trustee only the rights and powers necessary to achieve the purposes of the Trust. The Trust Agreement prohibits the Trust from engaging in any business or commercial activity or, with certain exceptions, any investment activity and from using any assets of the Trust to acquire any oil and gas lease, royalty or other mineral interest. 
 The Trustee is entitled to a fee for its services and to be reimbursed for Administrative Expenses from the Royalty Payments, and the cash reserve, and other sources available to the Trustee, including indemnification and sale of Trust assets. The Trustee may also be reimbursed for liabilities of the Trust through a loan in accordance with Section 6.06 of the Trust Agreement, or a sale of assets in accordance with Section 6.02 of the Trust Agreement, in each case under limited circumstances and subject to specified conditions, if the Royalty Payments or the cash reserve are insufficient to reimburse the Trustee for any liability or loss incurred by it in the performance of its duties. The Trust Agreement also provides that the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions, shall be indemnified by, and is entitled to receive reimbursement from (i) HNS (1) whenever the assets of the Trust are insufficient or not permitted by applicable law to provide such indemnity and (2) after the termination of the Trust to the extent that the Trustee did not have actual knowledge, or should not have reasonably known, of a potential claim against the Trustee for which a reserve could have been established and used to satisfy such claim prior or a potential claim subsequent to the final distribution of assets of the Trust upon its termination or to the extent any such reserve was insufficient and (ii) the assets of the Trust during any other period, against and from any and all liability, expense, claim, damage or loss (including reasonable legal fees and expenses and those of its agents and other professionals) incurred by it, individually or as Trustee, in the administration of the Trust and the Trust assets. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS - THE BP SUPPORT AGREEMENT, for information about BPs agreement to provide financial support to the Trust. 
 HNS has also agreed to indemnify the Trustee, individually and as Trustee, and the Trust against certain liabilities under the federal securities laws. 
 Sales of Royalty Interest; Borrowings and Reserves 
 With certain exceptions, the Trustee may sell all or part of the Royalty Interest or an interest therein only if authorized to do so by vote of the holders of 60% of the Units outstanding. Under certain circumstances, such as a sale of assets, the Trustee may sell all or part of the Royalty Interest or an interest therein without a vote of the Unit holders. However, if the sale is made in order to pay specific liabilities of the Trust then due and involves a part, but not all or substantially all, of the Trust assets, the sale only needs to be approved by the vote of holders of a majority of the Units outstanding. Any sale of Trust assets must be for cash unless otherwise authorized by 
 
3 


  the Unit holders. The Trustee is obligated to distribute the available net proceeds of any such sale to the Unit holders after satisfaction of the Trusts outstanding and unpaid liabilities (which would include, without limitation, any fees, costs, expenses, charges and Administrative Expenses), and establishing or increasing reserves for the future liabilities of the Trust. 
 The Trustee has the power to borrow on behalf of the Trust or to sell Trust assets to pay liabilities of the Trust and to establish a cash reserve for the payment of liabilities of the Trust without the consent of the Unit holders under the following circumstances: 
 

 | The Trustee may borrow from a lender not affiliated with the Trustee if cash on hand is not sufficient to pay current liabilities and the Trustee has determined that it is not practical to pay such liabilities out of funds anticipated to be available in subsequent quarters and that, without such borrowing, the Trust property is subject to the risk of loss or diminution in value. To secure payment of its borrowings on behalf of the Trust, the Trustee is authorized to encumber the Trusts assets and to carve out and convey production payments. The borrowing must be on terms which (in the opinion of an investment banking firm or commercial banking firm selected by the Trustee) are for fair market value and are commercially reasonable when compared to other available alternatives. No distributions to Unit holders may be made until the borrowings by the Trust have been repaid in full.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | If the Trustee is unable to borrow to pay Trust liabilities, the Trustee may sell Trust assets if it determines that the failure to pay the liabilities at a later date will be contrary to the best interest of the Unit holders and that it is not practicable to submit the sale to a vote of the Unit holders. The sale must be made for cash at a price which (in the opinion of an investment banking firm or commercial banking firm selected by the Trustee) is at least equal to the fair market value of the interest sold and is made on commercially reasonable terms when compared to other available alternatives.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The Trustee has the right to establish a cash reserve for the payment of material liabilities of the Trust which may become due if it determines that it is not practical to pay such liabilities out of funds anticipated to be available in subsequent quarters and that, in the absence of a reserve, the Trust property is subject to the risk of loss or diminution in value or the Trustee is subject to the risk of personal liability for such liabilities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In order for the Trustee to borrow, sell assets to pay Trust liabilities or establish a cash reserve for Trust liabilities, the Trustee must receive an unqualified written legal opinion that the contemplated action will not adversely affect the classification of the Trust as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes or cause the income from the Trust to be treated as unrelated business taxable income for federal income tax purposes. If the Trustee is unable to obtain the required legal opinion, it still may proceed with the borrowing or sale, or establish the reserve, if it determines that the failure to do so will be materially detrimental to the Unit holders considered as a whole. 
 Irrevocability; Amendment of the Trust Agreement 
 The Trust Agreement and the Trust are irrevocable. No person has the power to terminate, revoke or change the Trust Agreement except as described in the following paragraph and below under Termination of the Trust. 
 The Trust Agreement may be amended without a vote of the Unit holders to cure an ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision of the Trust Agreement that may be inconsistent with any other provision or to make any other provision with respect to matters arising under the Trust Agreement that does not adversely affect the Unit holders. The Trust Agreement also may be amended with the approval of holders of a majority of the outstanding Units. However, no such amendment may alter the relative rights of Unit holders unless approved by the affirmative vote of holders of 100% of the outstanding Units, nor may any amendment reduce or delay the distributions to the Unit holders, alter the voting rights of Unit holders or the number of Units in the Trust, or make certain other changes, unless approved by the affirmative vote of holders of at least 80% of the outstanding 
 
4 


  Units and by the Trustee. The Trustee is required to consent to any amendment approved by the requisite vote of Unit holders unless the amendment affects the Trustees rights, duties and immunities under the Trust Agreement. No amendment will be effective until the Trustee has received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or an opinion of counsel to the effect that such modification will not adversely affect the classification of the Trust as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes or cause the income from the Trust to be treated as unrelated business taxable income for federal income tax purposes. 
 Termination of the Trust 
 The Trust does not have a specific termination date. The Trust will terminate if either (a) holders of at least 60% of the Units outstanding vote to terminate the Trust or (b) the net revenues from the Royalty Interest for two successive years are less than $1,000,000 per year (unless the net revenues during the two-year period have been materially and adversely affected by a force majeure event). As used in the Trust Agreement, force majeure means, without limitation: (i) acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances; acts of public enemies; orders or restraints of any kind of the government of the United States or of the State of Alaska or any of their departments, agencies, political subdivisions or officials, or any civil or military authority; insurrections; civil disturbances; riots; epidemics; sabotage; war, whether or not declared; landslides; lightning; earthquakes; fires; hurricanes; winds; tornados; storms; droughts; floods; arrests; restraint of government and people; explosions; breakage, malfunction or accident to facilities, machinery, transmission pipes or canals; partial or entire failure of utilities; shortages of labor, materials, supplies or transportation; or (ii) any other cause, circumstance or event (other than depletion of the petroleum reservoir in which the Trust has an interest) not reasonably within the control of HNS. 
 Upon termination of the Trust, HNS will have an option to purchase the Royalty Interest at a price equal to the greater of (i) the fair market value of the Trust property as set forth in an opinion of an investment banking firm, commercial banking firm or other entity qualified to give an opinion as to the fair market value of the assets of the Trust, or (ii) the number of outstanding Units multiplied by (a) the closing price of Units on the day of termination of the Trust on the stock exchange on which the Units are listed, or (b) if the Units are not listed on any stock exchange but are traded in the over-the-counter market, the closing bid price on the day of termination of the Trust as quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The purchase must be for cash unless holders of 60% of the Units outstanding authorize the sale for non-cash consideration and the Trustee has received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or an opinion of counsel to the effect that such non-cash sale will not adversely affect the classification of the Trust as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes or cause the income from the Trust to be treated as unrelated business taxable income for federal income tax purposes. 
 If HNS does not exercise its option, the Trustee will sell the Trust property on terms and conditions approved by the vote of holders of 60% of the outstanding Units, unless the Trustee determines that it is not practicable to submit the matter to a vote of the Unit holders and the sale is made at a price at least equal to the fair market value of the Trust property as set forth in the opinion of the investment banking firm, commercial banking firm or other entity mentioned above and on terms and conditions deemed commercially reasonable by that firm. 
 The Trustee is obligated to distribute the available net proceeds of any such sale to the Unit holders after satisfaction of all of the Trusts liabilities (including, without limitation, any Administrative Expenses), and establishing or increasing reserves for the future liabilities of the Trust. 
 Unit holders do not have the right under the Trust Agreement to seek or secure any partition or distribution of the Royalty Interest or any other asset of the Trust or any accounting during the term of the Trust or during any period of liquidation and winding up. 
 Resignation or Removal of Trustee 
 The Trustee may resign at any time or be removed with or without cause by vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Units at a meeting called and held in accordance with the Trust Agreement. A successor trustee may 
 
5 


  be appointed by HNS or, if the Trustee has been removed at a meeting of the Unit holders, the successor trustee may be appointed by the Unit holders at the meeting. Any successor trustee must be a corporation organized, doing business and authorized to exercise trust powers under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, or a national banking association domiciled in the United States, in either case having a combined capital, surplus and undivided profits of at least $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authorities. Unless the Trust already has a trustee that is a resident of or has a principal office in Delaware, any successor trustee must be a resident of Delaware or have a principal office in Delaware. No resignation or removal of the Trustee will become effective until a successor trustee has accepted appointment. 
 Voting Rights of Unit Holders 
 Unit holders possess certain voting rights, but their voting rights are not comparable to those of shareholders of a corporation. For example, there is no requirement for annual meetings of Unit holders or for periodic reelection of the Trustee. 
 A meeting of the Unit holders may be called at any time to act with respect to any matter as to which the Trust Agreement authorizes the Unit holders to act. Any such meeting may be called by the Trustee in its discretion and will be called by the Trustee (i) as soon as practicable after receipt of a written request by HNS or a written request that sets forth in reasonable detail the action proposed to be taken at the meeting and is signed by holders of at least 25% of the Units outstanding or (ii) when required by applicable laws or regulations or the New York Stock Exchange. The Trustee will give written notice of any meeting stating the time and place of the meeting and the matters to be acted on not more than 60 days nor fewer than 10 days before the meeting to all Unit holders of record on a date not more than 60 days before the meeting at their addresses shown on the records of the Trust. All meetings of Unit holders are required to be held in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City. Unit holders are entitled to cast one vote on all matters coming before a meeting, in person or by proxy, for each Unit held on the record date for the meeting. 
 For more information regarding the Trust, see a copy of the Trust Agreement which has been filed with the SEC as an Exhibit 4.1 to this report. 
 THE ROYALTY INTEREST 
 The Royalty Interest is a property right under Alaska law which burdens production, but there is no other security interest in the reserves or production revenues assigned to it. The royalty payable to the Trust for each calendar quarter is the sum of the amounts obtained by multiplying Royalty Production for each day in the calendar quarter by the Per Barrel Royalty for that day. The payment under the Royalty Interest for any calendar quarter may not be less than zero nor more than the aggregate value of the total production of oil and condensate from HNSs working interest in the Prudhoe Bay Unit for the quarter, net of the State of Alaska royalty and less the value of any applicable payments made to affiliates of HNS. 
Royalty Production 
 The Royalty Production for each day in a calendar quarter is 16.4246% of the lesser of (i) the first 90,000 barrels of the actual average daily net production of crude oil and condensate for the quarter from the Prudhoe Bay (Permo-Triassic) Reservoir and saved and allocated to the oil and gas leases owned by HNS (as successor to BP Alaska) in the Prudhoe Bay field as of February 28, 1989 (the 1989 Working Interests), or (ii) the actual average daily net production of crude oil and condensate for the quarter from the 1989 Working Interests. The Royalty Production is based on oil produced from the oil rim and condensate produced from the gas cap, but not on gas production or natural gas liquids production. The actual average daily net production of oil and condensate from the 1989 Working Interests for any calendar quarter is the total production of oil and condensate for the quarter, net of the State of Alaska royalty, divided by the number of days in the quarter. 
 
6 


 Per Barrel Royalty 
 The Per Barrel Royalty for any day is the WTI Price for the day (as described below) less the sum of (i) Chargeable Costs multiplied by the Cost Adjustment Factor and (ii) Production Taxes. 
 WTI Price 
 The WTI Price for any trading day is (i) the price (in dollars per barrel) for West Texas intermediate crude oil of standard quality having a specific gravity of 40 API degrees for delivery at Cushing, Oklahoma (West Texas Intermediate, or WTI) quoted for that trading day by whichever of The Wall Street Journal, Reuters, or Platts Oilgram Price Report, in that order, publishes West Texas Intermediate price quotations for the trading day, or (ii) if the price of West Texas Intermediate is not published by one of those publications, the WTI Price will be the simple average of the daily mean prices (in dollars per barrel) quoted for West Texas Intermediate by one major oil company, one petroleum broker and one petroleum trading company designated by HNS, in each case unaffiliated with HNS and having substantial U.S. operations, until published price quotations are again available. If prices for West Texas Intermediate are not quoted so as to permit the calculation of the WTI Price, the price of West Texas Intermediate, for the purposes of calculating the WTI Price will be the price of another light sweet domestic crude oil of standard quality designated by HNS and approved by the Trustee, with appropriate allowance for transportation costs to the Gulf coast (or another appropriate location) to equilibrate its price to the WTI Price. The WTI Price for any day which is not a trading day is the WTI Price for the preceding trading day. 
 Chargeable Costs 
 The Chargeable Costs per barrel of Royalty Production for each calendar year are fixed amounts specified in the Conveyance and do not necessarily represent HNSs actual costs of production. Chargeable Costs per barrel were $20.00 during 2018, $23.75 during 2019, $26.50 during 2020, $29.25 during 2021 and $32.00 during 2022. After 2020, Chargeable Costs increase at a uniform rate of $2.75 per barrel per year, resulting in Chargeable Costs of $34.75 per barrel in 2023. 
Cost Adjustment Factor 
 Pursuant to the Overriding Royalty Conveyance, the Cost Adjustment Factor for a quarter was initially set as the ratio of the Consumer Price Index published for the most recently past February, May, August or November, as the case may be, to the Consumer Price Index for January 1989. The Overriding Royalty Conveyance provides, however, that if the average WTI Price for any calendar quarter falls to $18.00 or less, the Cost Adjustment Factor for that quarter will be the Cost Adjustment Factor for the immediately preceding quarter. If the average WTI Price returns to more than $18.00 for a later quarter, then for each subsequent quarter that the average WTI Price remains above $18.00, adjustments to the Cost Adjustment Factor resume, but with an adjustment to the formula that excludes changes in the Consumer Price Index during the period that adjustments to the Cost Adjustment Factor were suspended. 
 Pursuant to Section 4.5 of the Overriding Royalty Conveyance, the calculation of the Cost Adjustment Factor for each subsequent quarter that the WTI Price remains above $18.00 is the product of (x) the Cost Adjustment Factor for the most recently past calendar quarter in which the average WTI Price was equal to or less than $18.00 and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Consumer Price Index published for the most recently past February, May, August or November, as the case may be, and the denominator of which is the Consumer Price Index published for the most recently past February, May, August or November during a quarter in which the average WTI Price was equal to or less than $18.00. 
 Production Taxes 
 Production Taxes are the sum of any severance taxes, excise taxes (including windfall profit tax, if any), sales taxes, value added taxes or other similar or direct taxes imposed upon the reserves or production, delivery or sale of Royalty Production, computed at defined statutory rates.

 On April 14, 2013, Alaskas legislature passed an oil-tax reform bill amending Alaskas oil and gas production tax statutes, AS 43.55.11 et seq. (the Production Tax Statutes) with the aim of encouraging oil production and investment in Alaskas oil industry. On May 21, 2013, the Governor of Alaska signed the bill into law as chapter 10 of the 2013 Session laws of Alaska (the Act). The Production Tax Statutes were further amended through legislation enacted in 2014 and 2016. Among significant changes, the Act eliminated the monthly progressivity tax rate implemented by certain amendments to the Production Tax Statutes in 2006 and 2007, increased the base rate for oil production from 25% to 35% of the annual production tax value of taxable oil, and added a stair-step per-barrel tax credit for oil production. The amount of the per barrel oil production tax credit varies based on the gross value at the point of production for each barrel of taxable oil. However, the production tax credit may not reduce a producers tax liability below a minimum tax amount. A producers minimum tax is computed by multiplying the gross value at the point of production of their taxable production during the calendar year by a percentage ranging from zero to 4%. The percentage used to compute the minimum tax varies based on the average price per barrel for Alaska North Slope crude oil for sale on the United States West Coast during the calendar year. The changes to the Production Tax Statutes under the Act became effective on January 1, 2014. 
 On January 15, 2014, the Trustee executed a letter agreement with BP Alaska (as predecessor to HNS) dated January 15, 2014 (the 2014 Letter Agreement) regarding the implementation of the Act with respect to the Trust. Pursuant to the 2014 Letter Agreement, Production Taxes for the Trusts Royalty Production will equal the tax for the relevant quarter, minus the allowable monthly stair-step per-barrel tax credits for the Royalty Production during that quarter. If there is a minimum tax-related limitation on the amount of the stair-step per-barrel tax credits that could otherwise be claimed for any quarter during the year, any difference between that limitation as preliminarily determined on a quarterly basis and the actual limitation for the entire year will be reflected in the payment to the Trust for the first quarter Royalty Production in the following year. 
 On July 6, 2015, BP Alaska (as predecessor to HNS) and the Trustee signed a letter agreement (the 2014 Letter Agreement Amendment) amending the 2014 Letter Agreement to provide that if there is a minimum tax-related limitation on the amount of the stair-step per-barrel tax credits that could otherwise be claimed for any quarter during the year, any difference between that limitation as preliminarily determined on a quarterly basis and the actual limitation for the entire year will be reflected in the payment to the Trust for the fourth quarter Royalty Production payment for such year rather than in the payment to the Trust for the first quarter Royalty Production in the following year. 
 As a result of the 2014 Letter Agreement Amendment, any difference between the limitation as preliminarily determined for the first through third quarters of 2022 and the actual limitation for 2022 is reflected in the payment to the Trust for the fourth quarter of 2022, and not in the payment to the Trust for the first quarter of 2023.

 Per Barrel Royalty Calculations 
 The following table shows how the above-described factors interacted during the past five years to produce the average Per Barrel Royalty, if any, paid during the calendar years indicated. Royalty revenues are generally received on the fifteenth day of the month following the end of the calendar quarter in which the related Royalty Production occurred. Revenues and expenses presented in the statement of cash earnings and distributions presented in Part II, Item 8 below are recorded on a modified cash basis and, as a result, royalty revenues and distributions shown in such statements for any calendar year are attributable to HNSs operations during the twelve-month period ended September 30 of that year. Dollar amounts in the table have been rounded to two decimal places for presentation and do not reflect the precision of the actual calculations.

THE UNITS 
 Units 
 Each Unit represents an equal undivided share of beneficial interest in the Trust. The Units do not represent an interest in or an obligation of HNS, Standard Oil or any of their respective affiliates. Units are evidenced by transferable certificates issued by the Trustee. Each Unit entitles its holder to the same rights as the holder of any other Unit. The Trust has no other authorized or outstanding class of securities. 
Distributions of Income 
 HNS makes quarterly payments to the Trust of the amounts due with respect to the Trusts Royalty Interest on the fifteenth day following the end of each calendar quarter or, if the fifteenth is not a business day, on the next succeeding business day (the Quarterly Record Date). The Trustee pays all expenses of the Trust for 
 
9 


  each quarter on the Quarterly Record Date to the extent possible, then distributes the excess, if any, of the cash received by the Trust over the Trusts expenses, net of any additions to or subtractions from the cash reserve established for the payment of estimated liabilities (the Quarterly Distribution), to the persons in whose names the Units were registered at the close of business on the Quarterly Record Date. 
 The Trust Agreement requires the Trustee to pay the Quarterly Distribution to Unit holders on the fifth day after the Trustees receipt of the amount paid by HNS. Cash balances held by the Trustee for distribution to Unit holders are required to be invested in United States government or agency obligations secured by the full faith and credit of the United States (Government Obligations) or, if Government Obligations that mature on the date of the distribution to Unit holders are not available, in repurchase agreements secured by Government Obligations with banks having capital, surplus and undivided profits of $100,000,000 or more (which may include The Bank of New York Mellon). If time does not permit the Trustee to invest collected funds in Government Obligations or repurchase agreements, the Trustee may invest funds overnight in a time deposit with a bank meeting the foregoing capital requirement (including The Bank of New York Mellon). 
 Reports to Unit Holders 
 After the end of each calendar year, the Trustee provides a report to the persons who held Units of record during the year containing information to enable them to make the calculations necessary for federal and Alaska income tax purposes, including the calculation of any depletion or other deduction which may be available to them for the calendar year. In addition, after the end of each calendar year, the Trustee provides Unit holders an annual report containing a copy of this Form 10-K and certain other information required by the Trust Agreement. 
 Limited Liability of Unit Holders 
 The Trust Agreement provides that the Unit holders are, to the full extent permitted by Delaware law, entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit under Delaware law. 
Possible Divestiture of Units 
 The Trust Agreement imposes no restrictions on nationality or other status of the persons eligible to hold Units. However, it provides that if at any time the Trust or the Trustee is named a party in any judicial or administrative proceeding seeking the cancellation or forfeiture of any property in which the Trust has an interest because of the nationality, or any other status, of any one or more Unit holders, the Trustee may require each holder whose nationality or other status is an issue in the proceeding to dispose of his Units to a party not of the nationality or other status at issue in the proceeding. If any holder fails to dispose of his Units within 30 days after receipt of notice from the Trustee to do so, the Trustee will redeem any Units not so transferred within 90 days after the end of the 30-day period specified in the notice for a cash price equal to the fair market value of the Units. Units redeemed by the Trustee will be cancelled. 
 The Trustee may cause the Trust to borrow any amount required to redeem the Units. If the purchase of Units from an ineligible holder by the Trustee would result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1970, or under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the Units subject to the Trustees right of redemption will be purchased by HNS or a designee of HNS. 
Issuance of Additional Units 
 The Trust Agreement provides that HNS or an affiliate from time to time may assign to the Trust additional royalty interests meeting certain conditions and, upon satisfaction of various other conditions, the Trust may issue up to an additional 18,600,000 Units. HNS (as successor to BP Alaska) has not conveyed any additional royalty interests to the Trust, and the Trust has not issued any additional Units. 
 
10 


 THE BP SUPPORT AGREEMENT 
 BP agreed to provide financial support to BP Alaska (as predecessor to HNS) in meeting its payment obligations to the Trust in a Support Agreement dated February 28, 1989, among BP, BP Alaska, Standard Oil and the Trust (the Support Agreement). Within 30 days after BP receives notice from the Trustee that the royalty payable with respect to the Royalty Interest or any other amount payable by HNS or Standard Oil has not been paid to the Trustee (including without limitation, the obligation to make payments as indemnification), BP agreed to cause HNS and Standard Oil to satisfy their respective payment obligations to the Trust and the Trustee under the Trust Agreement and the Conveyance, including contributing to HNS the funds necessary to make such payments. BP is required to make available to HNS and Standard Oil such financial support as HNS, Standard Oil or the Trustee may request in writing. Any Unit holder has the unconditional right to institute suit against BP to enforce BPs obligations under the Support Agreement. 
 Neither BP nor HNS may transfer or assign its rights or obligations under the Support Agreement without the prior written consent of the Trustee, except that BP can arrange for its obligations to be performed by any of its affiliates so long as BP remains responsible for ensuring that its obligations are performed in a timely manner. 
 HNS may sell or transfer all or part of its working interest in the Prudhoe Bay Unit, although such a transfer will not relieve BP of its responsibility to ensure that HNSs payment obligations with respect to the Royalty Interest and under the Trust Agreement and the Conveyance are performed. 
 BP shall be released from its obligation under the Support Agreement upon the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of HNSs working interest in the Prudhoe Bay Unit if the transferee agrees in writing to assume and be bound by BPs obligation under the Support Agreement. The transferees agreement to assume BPs obligations must be reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the transferee must be an entity having a rating of its unsecured, unsupported long-term debt of at least A3 from Moodys Investors Service, Inc., a rating of at least A- from Standard & Poors, or an equivalent rating from at least one nationally-recognized statistical rating organization (after giving effect to the sale or transfer and the assumption of all of HNSs obligations under the Conveyance and all of BPs obligations under the Support Agreement). BPs obligations under the Support Agreement remain in effect following the completion Hilcorps acquisition of BPs interest in BP Alaska. 
 For more information regarding the Support Agreement, see a copy of the Support Agreement which has been filed with the SEC as an Exhibit 4.4 to this report. 
 THE PRUDHOE BAY UNIT AND FIELD 
 Prudhoe Bay Unit Operation and Ownership 
 Since several oil companies besides HNS hold acreage within the Prudhoe Bay field, as well as several contiguous oil fields, the Prudhoe Bay Unit was established to optimize field development. Other owners of these fields include affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation, ConocoPhillips and Chevron Corporation. The Trusts Royalty Interest pertains only to production from the 1989 Working Interests in the Prudhoe Bay field and does not include production from the other oil fields included in the Prudhoe Bay Unit. 
 The operations of HNS and the other working interest owners in the Prudhoe Bay Unit are governed by an agreement dated April 1, 1977 among the State of Alaska and the working interest owners establishing the Prudhoe Bay Unit (the Prudhoe Bay Unit Agreement) and an agreement dated April 1, 1977 among the working interest owners governing Prudhoe Bay Unit operations (the Prudhoe Bay Unit Operating Agreement). 
 The Prudhoe Bay Unit Operating Agreement specifies the allocation of production and costs to the working interest owners. It also defines operator responsibilities and voting requirements and is unusual in its establishment of separate participating areas for the gas cap and oil rim. BP Alaska served as the sole operator of the Prudhoe Bay Unit until June 30, 2020, when Hilcorp completed its acquisition of BP Alaska, converted it to a limited liability company, and changed its name to HNS. 
 
11 


 The ownership of the Prudhoe Bay Unit by participating area as of December 31, 2022 is shown in the following table: 
 

 | Oil rim | | | Gas cap
HNS | | 26.36 | %(a) | | 26.36 | %(b)
Exxon Mobil | | 36.40 | | | 36.40 | 
ConocoPhillips | | 36.08 | | | 36.08 | 
Chevron | | 1.16 | | | 1.16 | 
Total | | 100.00 | % | | 100.00 | % 


(a) | The Trusts share of oil production and condensate is computed based on HNSs (as successor to BP Alaska) ownership interest in the oil rim participating area of 50.68% as of February 28, 1989. Subsequent decreases in HNSs participation in oil rim ownership do not affect calculation of Royalty Production from the 1989 Working Interests and have not decreased the Trusts Royalty Interest.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | The Trusts share of condensate production is computed based on HNSs (as successor to BP Alaska) ownership interest in the gas cap participating area of 13.84% as of February 28, 1989. Subsequent increases in HNSs gas cap ownership do not affect calculation of Royalty Production from the 1989 Working Interests and have not increased the Trusts Royalty Interest. Under the terms of an Issues Resolution Agreement entered into by the Prudhoe Bay Unit owners in October 1990, produced condensate (defined as the Original Condensate Reserve in the agreement) from the gas cap participating area was allocated to that participating area until a cumulative limit of 1,175 million barrels was reached. This cumulative limit was reached in June 2014, and beginning at that time and continuing thereafter, the condensate is allocated to the oil rim participating area.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If HNS fails to pay any costs and expenses chargeable to HNS under the Prudhoe Bay Unit Operating Agreement and the production of oil and condensate is insufficient to pay such costs and expenses, the Royalty Interest is chargeable with a pro rata portion of such costs and expenses and is subject to the enforcement against it of liens granted to the operators of the Prudhoe Bay Unit. However, in the Conveyance, HNS agreed to pay all costs and expenses chargeable to it and to ensure that no such costs and expenses will be chargeable against the Royalty Interest. The Trust is not liable for any loss or liability incurred by HNS or others attributable to HNSs working interest in the Prudhoe Bay Unit or to the oil produced from it, and HNS has agreed to indemnify the Trust and hold it harmless against any such impositions. 
 HNS has the right to amend or terminate the Prudhoe Bay Unit Agreement, the Prudhoe Bay Unit Operating Agreement and any leases or conveyances with respect to the 1989 Working Interests in the exercise of its reasonable and prudent business judgment without liability to the Trust. HNS also has the right to sell or assign all or any part of the 1989 Working Interests, so long as the sale or assignment is expressly made subject to the Royalty Interest and the terms and provisions of the Conveyance. 
 The Prudhoe Bay Field 
 The Prudhoe Bay field is located on the North Slope of Alaska, 250 miles north of the Arctic Circle and 650 miles north of Anchorage. The Prudhoe Bay field extends approximately 12 miles by 27 miles and contains nearly 150,000 gross productive acres. Approximately 45% of the acreage within the field is subject to the Royalty Interest granted to the Trust by the Conveyance. The Prudhoe Bay field, which was discovered in 1968 by BP and others, has been in production since 1977 and is the largest producing oil field in North America. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 12.8 billion barrels of oil and condensate had been produced from the Prudhoe Bay field. 
Field Geology 
 The principal hydrocarbon accumulations at Prudhoe Bay are in the Ivishak sandstone of the Sadlerochit Group at a depth of approximately 8,700 feet below sea level. The Ivishak is overlain by four minor reservoirs of varying extent which are designated the Put River, Eileen, Sag River and Shublik (PESS) formations. 
 
12 


  Underlying the Sadlerochit Group are the oil-bearing Lisburne and Endicott formations. The net production allocated to the Royalty Interest pertains only to the Ivishak and PESS formations, collectively known as the Prudhoe Bay (Permo-Triassic) Reservoir, and does not pertain to the Lisburne and Endicott formations. 
 The Ivishak sandstone was deposited, commencing some 250 million years ago, during the Permian and Triassic geologic periods. The sediments in the Ivishak are composed of sandstone, conglomerate and shale which were deposited by a massive braided river and delta system that flowed from an ancient mountain system to the north. Oil was trapped in the Ivishak by a combination of structural and stratigraphic trapping mechanisms. 
 Gross reservoir thickness is 550 feet, with a maximum oil column thickness of 425 feet. The original oil column is bounded on the top by a gas-oil contact, originally at 8,575 feet below sea level across the main field, and on the bottom by an oil-water contact at approximately 9,000 feet below sea level. A layer of heavy oil and tar overlays the oil-water contact in the main field and has an average thickness of around 40 feet. 
 Oil Characteristics 
 The oil produced from the Prudhoe Bay (Permo-Triassic) Reservoir is a medium grade, low sulfur crude with an average specific gravity of 27 API degrees. The gas cap composition is such that, upon surfacing, a liquid hydrocarbon phase, known as condensate, is formed. 
 The Royalty Interest is based upon oil produced from the oil rim and condensate produced from the gas cap, but not upon gas production (which is currently uneconomic on a large scale) or natural gas liquids production stripped from gas produced. 
 Historical Production 
 Production from the Prudhoe Bay field began on June 19, 1977, with the completion of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). As of December 31, 2022, there were 1,107 active producing oil wells, 39 gas reinjection wells, 321 water injection wells and water and miscible gas injection wells in the Prudhoe Bay field. Production wells drilled in the field during the three years ended December 31, 2022 were: 8 in 2020, 3 in 2021 and 20 in 2022. These include new sidetrack completions in existing wells. No exploratory drilling activities were conducted in the field during the three-year period ended December 31, 2022. Production from the Prudhoe Bay field reached a peak in 1988 and has declined steadily since then. The average well production rate was about 166 barrels per day in 2018, 163 barrels per day in 2019, 162 barrels per day in 2020, 159 barrels per day in 2021, and 157 barrels per day in 2022. 
 HNSs share of the hydrocarbon liquids production from the Prudhoe Bay field includes oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. Using the production allocation procedures from the Prudhoe Bay Unit Operating Agreement, the Prudhoe Bay fields total production and the net share of oil and condensate (net of State of Alaska royalty) allocated to the 1989 Working Interests have been as follows during the past five years: 
 

Calendar year | | Oil | | | Condensate
 | Total field | | | Net to 1989WorkingInterests | | Total field | Net to 1989WorkingInterests | 
 | | (thousand barrels per day) | 
2018 | | | 174.2 | | | 77.3 | | 0.0 | (a) | 0.0 | (a)
2019 | | | 170.2 | | | 75.5 | | 0.0 | (a) | 0.0 | (a)
2020 | | | 167.0 | | | 74.0 | | 0.0 | (a) | 0.0 | (a)

2022 | | | 156.6 | | | 69.5 | | 0.0 | (a) | 0.0 | (a)


(a) | Having reached the cumulative condensate limit in June 2014, pursuant to the Issues Resolution Agreement all condensate produced from the Initial Participating Area (IPA) is now allocated to the Oil Rim IPA for accounting purposes.

 Collection and Transportation of Prudhoe Bay Oil 
 Raw crude oil produced from individual production wells located at well pads is diverted to flowlines (pipelines). The flowlines transport the raw crude oil to one of six separation facilities (three on the western side of the Prudhoe Bay Unit and three on the eastern side) where the water and natural gas mixed with the raw crude are removed. The stabilized crude is then sent from the separation facilities through transit lines, one from each half of the Prudhoe Bay Unit, to Pump Station 1, the starting point for TAPS. 
 At Pump Station 1, Alyeska Pipeline Service Company (Alyeska), the operator of TAPS, meters the oil and pumps it in the 48-inch diameter pipeline to Valdez, almost 800 miles (1,288 km) to the south, where it is either loaded onto marine tankers or stored temporarily. It currently takes the oil about 20 days to make the trip from the Prudhoe Bay Unit to Valdez. TAPS has a mechanical capacity of 2.1 million barrels of oil a day. During 2022, TAPS averaged 483,415 barrels per day, according to Alyeska. 
 Following a partial shutdown of the eastern side of the Prudhoe Bay Unit which lasted from August 7 until September 22, 2006, BP Alaska replaced approximately 16 miles of oil transit lines and implemented new integrity management and corrosion monitoring practices that supplemented or replaced the practices that existed in 2006. 
 Reservoir Management 
 The Prudhoe Bay field is a complex, combination-drive reservoir, with widely varying reservoir properties. Reservoir management involves directing field activities and projects to maximize the economic value of reserves. 
 Several different oil recovery mechanisms are currently active in the Prudhoe Bay field, including pressure depletion, gravity drainage/gas cap expansion, water flooding and miscible gas flooding. Separate yet integrated reservoir management strategies have been developed for the areas affected by each of these recovery processes. 
 Reserve Estimates 
 Proved oil reserves attributable to the 1989 Working Interests at December 31, 2022, are those quantities of oil which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from 2023 forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Estimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and subjective and are revised over time as additional data becomes available. Such revisions often may be substantial. HNSs reserve estimates and production assumptions and projections are predicated upon a reasonable estimate of the allocation of hydrocarbon liquids between oil and condensate according to the procedures of the Prudhoe Bay Unit Operating Agreement. Oil and condensate are physically produced in a commingled stream of hydrocarbon liquids. The allocation of hydrocarbon liquids between the oil and condensate from the Prudhoe Bay field is a theoretical calculation performed in accordance with procedures specified in the Prudhoe Bay Unit Operating Agreement. Under the terms of an Issues Resolution Agreement entered into by the Prudhoe Bay Unit owners in October 1990 (the Issuers Resolution Agreement), the allocation procedures were adjusted to generally allocate condensate in a manner which approximates the anticipated decline in the production of oil until an agreed original condensate reserve of 1,175 million barrels has been allocated to the working interest owners. 
 There is no precise method of forecasting the allocation of reserve volumes to the Trust. The Royalty Interest is not a working interest and the Trust is not entitled to receive any specific volume of reserves from the 1989 Working Interests. The reserve volumes attributable to the 1989 Working Interests are estimated using an allocation of reserve volumes based on estimated future production and the average unweighted arithmetic average of the WTI Price on the first day of each month during the year ($93.67 per barrel for the 12-month period prior to December 31, 2022) in accordance with SEC regulations, and assume no future movement in the Consumer Price Index and no changes to the procedure for calculating Production Taxes. The estimated reserve volumes attributable to the Trust will vary if different estimates of production, prices and other factors are used. 
 
14 


  Even if expected reservoir performance does not change, the estimated reserves, economic life, and future revenues attributable to the Trust may change significantly in the future. This may result from changes in the WTI Price or from changes in other prescribed variables utilized in calculations defined by the Overriding Royalty Conveyance. 
 The reserves attributable to the 1989 Working Interests constitute only a part of the overall reserves in the Prudhoe Bay Unit. As a result of the 2022 SEC-defined 12-month average WTI Price of $93.67, HNS estimated net remaining proved reserves attributable to the Trust as of December 31, 2022 are 8.232 million barrels of oil, of which 7.862 million barrels are proved developed reserves and 0.370 million barrels are proved undeveloped reserves. Proved developed reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Proved undeveloped reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Additional information regarding estimated quantities of proved oil and condensate, proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves is found below in Supplemental Reserve Information and Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flow Relating to Proved Reserves (Unaudited) following the Notes to Financial Statements. 
 In all cases, the volumes are being progressed as a part of an adopted development plan that calls for drilling of wells over a period of time. There were no contributions to proved undeveloped reserves from extensions or discoveries during 2022. Based on the 2022 12-month average WTI Price of $93.67 per barrel (the unweighted arithmetic average of the WTI Price on the first day of each month during the year), other economic parameters prescribed by the Conveyance, and utilizing procedures specified in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC) 932, Extractive Activities  Oil and Gas, HNS calculated that as of December 31, 2022, production of oil and condensate from the proved reserves allocated to the 1989 Working Interests will result in estimated future net revenues to the Trust of $61.169 million and a present value of future net revenues to the Trust of $56.751 million. For the economic conditions and production forecast as of December 31, 2022, the per barrel royalty will be zero following the year 2024. Therefore, no reserves are currently attributed to the Trust after that date. In the event of changes in HNSs current assumptions, including price, oil and condensate recoveries may be changed from the current estimates. 
 The internal controls applicable to the foregoing estimates of the reserves allocated to the Trust are those employed by HNS, which provides the information to the Trustee. HNS has advised the Trustee that its reserves process is managed by its Reserves Manager, the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of all of its reserve estimates. HNS Reserves Manager has over 20 years of reservoir and operations experience, holds a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering from Texas A&M University, is a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas, and is a member of the SPE. The Trust employs Miller and Lents, Ltd., an international oil and gas consulting firm, to conduct an annual review of HNSs estimates of the proved reserves allocated to the Trust, estimated future net revenues to the Trust, and the remaining period of economic production from the Prudhoe Bay field attributable to the Trust. All Miller and Lents, Ltd. staff members assigned to the BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust are licensed professional engineers. Work was supervised by a licensed professional engineer with more than 20 years of experience with the Trust. A copy of the February 24, 2023, report of Miller and Lents, Ltd. is filed as Exhibit 99 to this report. 
 HNSs net production of oil and condensate allocated to the Trust from proved reserves attributable to the Trust was less than 90,000 barrels per day on an annual basis in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. HNS anticipates that its average net production of oil and condensate from proved reserves attributable to the Trust will be below 90,000 barrels per day on an annual average basis during future years. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS for additional information. 
 Based on the 2022 twelve-month average WTI Price of $93.67 per barrel, current Production Taxes, and the Chargeable Costs adjusted as prescribed by the Overriding Royalty Conveyance, HNS estimates that royalty payments to the Trust will continue through the year 2024 and would be zero the following year. Therefore, no 
 
15 


  proved reserves are currently attributed to the BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust after that date. Even if expected reservoir performance does not change, the estimated reserves, economic life and future net revenues attributable to the Trust may change significantly in the future. This may result from sustained periods of change in the WTI Price, the Production Tax or from changes in other prescribed variables utilized in calculations as defined by the Overriding Royalty Conveyance. In order for the Trust to have associated reserves and future net revenues, the twelve-month average WTI Price per barrel must exceed the Production Taxes and Adjusted Chargeable Costs as prescribed by the Overriding Royalty Conveyance. Assuming a WTI price of $93.67 per barrel, which was the SEC-defined 12-month average in 2022, the projected value of the of the Production Taxes and Adjusted Chargeable Costs as prescribed by the Overriding Royalty Conveyance is $83.03 per barrel in 2023 and $89.34 per barrel in 2024 and continues to increase thereafter. 
 HNS is under no obligation to make investments in development projects which would add additional non-proved resources to proved reserves and cannot make such investments without the concurrence of the Prudhoe Bay Unit working interest owners. The Prudhoe Bay Unit working interest owners regularly assess the technical and economic attractiveness of implementing projects to increase Prudhoe Bay Unit proved reserves. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS for additional information. 
 INDUSTRY CONDITIONS AND REGULATIONS 
 The production of oil and gas in Alaska is affected by many state and federal regulations with respect to allowable rates of production, marketing, environmental matters and pricing. Future regulations could change allowable rates of production or the manner in which oil and gas operations may be lawfully conducted. 
 In general, HNSs oil and gas activities are subject to existing federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to health, safety, environmental quality and pollution control. HNS believes that the equipment and facilities currently being used in its operations generally comply with the applicable legislation and regulations. During the past few years, numerous environmental laws and regulations have taken effect at the federal, state and local levels. Oil and gas operations are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and to interruption or termination by governmental authorities due to ecological and other considerations and in certain circumstances impose absolute liability upon lessees for the cost of cleaning up pollutants and for pollution damages resulting from their operations. Although HNS has advised the Trustee that the existence of legislation and regulation has had no material adverse effect on HNSs current method of operations, the effect of future legislation and regulations cannot be predicted. 
 Since the end of 2006, the corrosion monitoring and mitigation practices for the oil transit lines in the Prudhoe Bay Unit have been monitored and reviewed by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The construction, testing, and commissioning of the new replacement oil transit lines have been inspected by DOT inspectors. The replacement lines have been constructed and are operated and maintained in accordance with the requirements of the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 (the PIPES Act). The applicable requirements of the subsequent regulations of the PIPES Act began to be phased-in in 2012. The PIPES Act was most recently amended in December 2020. The PIPES Act of 2020 strengthens the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administrations safety authority and includes provisions that advance the safe transportation of energy and other hazardous materials. The Prudhoe Bay Unit is monitoring developments under the PIPES Act of 2020 and its implementing regulations. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS - THE PRUDHOE BAY UNIT AND FIELD - COLLECTION AND TRANSPORTATION OF PRUDHOE BAY OIL for additional information. 
 CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
 The following is a summary of the principal tax consequences to Unit holders resulting from the ownership and disposition of Units. The laws and regulations affecting these matters are complex, and are subject to change by future legislation or regulations or new interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service, state taxing authorities

  or the courts. In addition, there may be differences of opinion as to the applicability or interpretation of present tax laws and regulations. HNS and the Trust have not requested any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the tax treatment of the Units, and no assurance can be given that the Internal Revenue Service would concur with the statements below. 
 Unit holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effects on their specific tax situations of owning and disposing of Units. 
 Federal Income Tax 
 Classification of the Trust 
 The following discussion assumes that the Trust is properly classified as a grantor trust under current law and is not an association taxable as a corporation. 
General Features of Grantor Trust Taxation 
 A grantor trust is not subject to tax, and its beneficiaries (the Unit holders in the case of the Trust) are considered for tax purposes to own the assets of the trust directly. The Trust pays no federal income tax but files an information return reporting all items of income or deduction. If a court were to hold that the Trust is an association taxable as a corporation, the Trust would incur substantial income tax liabilities in addition to its other expenses. 
Taxation of Unit Holders 
 In computing his federal income tax liability, each Unit holder is required to take into account his share of all items of Trust income, gain, loss, deduction, credit and tax preference, based on the Unit holders method of accounting. Consequently, it is possible that in any year a Unit holders share of the taxable income of the Trust may exceed the cash actually distributed to him in that year. For example, if the Trustee should add to the reserve for the payment of Trust liabilities or repay money borrowed to satisfy debts of the Trust, the money used to replenish the reserve or to repay the loan is income to and must be reported by the Unit holder, even though the money was not distributed to the Unit holder. In 2020 certain indemnity payments were made by HNS to the Trust to reimburse it for Administrative Expenses incurred in accordance with the Trust Agreement because the Trust did not receive any Royalty Payments attributable to the four quarters during 2020, as described in Item 7 in Part II below. For federal income tax purposes, the receipt of the indemnity payments and the expenses paid with those indemnity payments will not be treated as income or deductions of the Trust or of any Unit holder. 
 The Trust makes quarterly distributions, to the extent available, to the persons who held Units of record on each Quarterly Record Date. The terms of the Trust Agreement seek to assure to the extent practicable that income, expenses and deductions attributable to each distribution are reportable by the Unit holder who receives the distribution. 
 The Trust allocates income and deductions to Unit holders based on record ownership at Quarterly Record Dates. It is not known whether the Internal Revenue Service will accept the allocation based on this method. 
 Depletion Deductions 
 The owner of an economic interest in producing oil and gas properties is entitled to deduct an allowance for the greater of cost depletion or (if otherwise allowable) percentage depletion on each such property. A Unit holders deduction for cost depletion in any year is calculated by multiplying the holders adjusted tax basis in his Units (generally his cost less prior depletion deductions) by Royalty Production during the year and dividing that product by the sum of Royalty Production during the year and estimated remaining Royalty Production as of the end of the year. The allowance for percentage depletion generally does not apply to interests in proven oil and gas properties that were transferred after December 31, 1974 and prior to October 12, 1990. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 repealed this rule for transfers occurring on or after October 12, 1990. Unit

  holders who acquired their Units on or after that date may be permitted to deduct an allowance for percentage depletion if such deduction would otherwise exceed the allowable deduction for cost depletion. In order to take percentage depletion, a Unit holder must qualify for the independent producer exemption contained in section 613A(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Percentage depletion is based on the Unit holders gross income from the Trust rather than on his adjusted basis in his Units. Any deduction for cost depletion or percentage depletion allowable to a Unit holder reduces his adjusted basis in his Units for purposes of computing subsequent depletion or gain or loss on any subsequent disposition of Units. 
 Unit holders must maintain records of their adjusted basis in their Units, make adjustments for depletion deductions to such basis, and use the adjusted basis for the computation of gain or loss on the disposition of the Units. 
 Taxation of Foreign Unit Holders 
 Generally, a holder of Units who is a nonresident alien individual or which is a foreign corporation (a Foreign Taxpayer) is subject to tax on the gross income produced by the Royalty Interest at a rate equal to 30% (or at a lower treaty rate, if applicable). This tax is withheld by the Trustee and remitted directly to the United States Treasury. A Foreign Taxpayer may elect to treat the income from the Royalty Interest as effectively connected with the conduct of a United States trade or business under Internal Revenue Code section 871 or section 882, or pursuant to any similar provisions of applicable treaties. If a Foreign Taxpayer makes this election, it is entitled to claim all deductions with respect to such income, but a United States federal income tax return must be filed to claim such deductions. This election once made is irrevocable unless an applicable treaty provides otherwise or unless the Secretary of the Treasury consents to a revocation. 
 Section 897 of the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder treat the Trust as if it were a United States real property holding corporation. Foreign holders owning more than five percent of the outstanding Units are subject to United States federal income tax on the gain on the disposition of their Units. Foreign Unit holders owning less than five percent of the outstanding Units are not subject to United States federal income tax on the gain on the disposition of their Units, unless they have elected under Internal Revenue Code section 871 or section 882 to treat the income from the Royalty Interest as effectively connected with the conduct of a United States trade or business. 
 If a Foreign Taxpayer is a corporation which made an election under Internal Revenue Code section 882(d), the corporation would also be subject to a 30% tax under Internal Revenue Code section 884. This tax is imposed on U.S. branch profits of a foreign corporation that are not reinvested in the U.S. trade or business. This tax is in addition to the tax on effectively connected income. The branch profits tax may be either reduced or eliminated by treaty. 
 Sale of Units 
 Generally, a Unit holder will realize gain or loss on the sale or exchange of his Units measured by the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and his adjusted basis for such Units. Gain on the sale of Units by a holder that is not a dealer with respect to such Units will generally be treated as capital gain. However, pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 1254, certain depletion deductions claimed with respect to the Units must be recaptured as ordinary income upon sale or disposition of such interest. 
Backup Withholding 
 A payor must withhold 24% of any reportable payment if the payee fails to furnish his taxpayer identification number (TIN) to the payor in the required manner or if the Secretary of the Treasury notifies the payor that the TIN furnished by the payee is incorrect. Unit holders will avoid backup withholding by furnishing their correct TINs to the Trustee in the form required by law.

 Widely Held Fixed Investment Trusts 
 The Trustee assumes that some Trust Units are held by a middleman, as such term is broadly defined in the U.S. Treasury Regulations (which includes custodians, nominees, certain joint owners, and brokers holding an interest for a custodian in street name). Therefore, the Trustee considers the Trust to be a widely held fixed investment trust (WHFIT) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. is the representative of the Trust that will provide tax information in accordance with applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the Trust as a WHFIT. For information contact The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., Global Corporate Trust  Corporate Finance, 601 Travis Street, Floor 16, Houston, TX 77002, telephone number (713) 483-6020.State Income Taxes 
 Unit holders may be required to report their share of income from the Trust to their state of residence or commercial domicile. However, only corporate Unit holders will need to report their share of income to the State of Alaska. Alaska does not currently impose an income tax on individuals or estates and trusts. All Trust income is Alaska source income to corporate Unit holders and should be reported accordingly. 
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act 
 Pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (commonly referred to as FATCA), distributions from the Trust to foreign financial institutions and certain other non-financial foreign entities may be subject to U.S. withholding taxes. Specifically, certain withholdable payments (including certain royalties, interest and other gains or income from U.S. sources) made to a foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity will generally be subject to the withholding tax unless the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity complies with certain information reporting, withholding, identification, certification and related requirements imposed by FATCA. Foreign financial institutions and non-financial foreign entities located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules. Foreign Unit holders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of these withholding provisions on their investment in Trust Units.
