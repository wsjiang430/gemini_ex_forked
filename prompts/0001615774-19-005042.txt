Our present corporate structure is as follows:
 


Our Business
 
We operate Jiarun Hospital and its two branch hospitals, collectively being a private hospital with 950 beds located in Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang Province in northeastern China. Jiarun Hospital offers patients care and pharmaceuticals in the areas of both Western and Chinese medical practices. Jiarun specializes in Pediatrics, Dermatology, Ears, Nose and Throat (ENT), Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Ophthalmology, Internal Medicine Dentistry, General Surgery, Rehabilitation Science, Gynecology, General Medical Services, etc. Our ambulances operate 24 hours a day.
 
As is common in China, we generate revenues from both the provision of patient services and the sale of pharmaceuticals. These two areas respectively were responsible for 61% and 39% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, and 55% and 45% of the total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 
 Patient Services
 
In accordance with the medical licenses under which Jiarun operates, the scope of the Hospital’s approved patient services includes medical consulting, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, anesthesia, clinic laboratory, medical imaging, and traditional Chinese medicine.
 
Patient service revenue is recognized when it is both earned and realized. The Company’s policy is to recognize patient service revenue when the medical service has been provided to the patient and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured.
 
The Company provides services to both patients covered by social insurance and patients who are not covered by social insurance. The Company charges the same rates for patient services regardless of the coverage by social insurance.
 
Patients who are not covered by social insurance are liable for the total cost of medical treatment.
 

● | For out-patient medical services, revenue is recognized when the Company provides medical service to the patient. The Company collects payment before the patient leaves the hospital.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | For in-patient medical services, when a patient checks into the hospital, the Company estimates the approximate fee the patient will spend in the hospital based on patient’s symptoms, collects the estimated fee from the patient, and records the payment as a deposit. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
During the in-patient services period, the Company recognizes revenue when the patient service is provided and deducts the cost of service from the deposit received. The Company records these transactions based on daily reports generated by the respective medical department. When medical services exceed patient deposits received, the Company records revenue and accounts receivable when the patient services are provided.

When a patient checks out from the hospital, the Company calculates and determines the remaining deposit, if any, and refunds the unused portion of the deposit to the patients. In the case where the patient has a balance in accounts receivable, the account receivable is required to be paid in full at checkout.
 
Patients covered by social insurance will receive a portion or full medical services reimbursed or paid by the social insurance agencies via prepaid cards or the insurance claim settlement process.
 
Pharmaceuticals
 
Revenue from the sale of pharmaceuticals is recognized when it is both earned and realized. The Company’s policy is to recognize the sale of pharmaceuticals when the title of the pharmaceuticals, ownership and risk of loss have transferred to the purchaser, and collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured, all of which generally occur when the patient receives the pharmaceuticals.
 
Given the nature of this revenue source, and the applicable rules guiding revenue recognition, the revenue recognition practices for the sale of pharmaceuticals do not contain estimates that materially affect results of operations nor any policy for return of products.
 
Jiarun Hospital opened in its current location in December 2014. In April 2018 we added a building to the hospital complex for delivery of outpatient services. In October and November 2017, NRB Hospital and 2nd Branch Hospital were incorporated in Harbin City; they started to operate in April 2018, providing outpatient and inpatient services.
 
JRSS plans to acquire other hospitals and companies involved in the healthcare industry in the PRC using cash and shares of our common stock. Substantial capital may be needed for these acquisitions and we may need to raise additional funds through the sale of our common stock, debt financing or other arrangements. We do not have any commitments or arrangements from any person to provide us with any additional capital. Additional capital may not be available to us, or if available, on acceptable terms, in which case we would not be able to acquire other hospitals or businesses in the healthcare industry.
 
 Customers
 
The Company has successfully marketed our value proposition to a large number of corporate customers as well as individual customers. We are in direct competition with two government-owned hospitals in the Hulan district of Harbin City. Management believes we are able to offer a more comprehensive examination menu at competitive prices, and provide an affordable “one-stop” service to our corporate customers who contract us to provide healthcare services to their employees and clients across the country. We are also able to provide our customers with satisfying experiences by providing customized services, streamlined processes, access to advanced equipment, a comfortable environment, customer service-oriented staff and greater privacy, characteristics which are highly valued by our corporate and individual customers.
Suppliers
 
Over the years of operations, we have developed a solid and reliable image and reputation with the general public and the medical academia and industry. Leveraging our positive track record and brand name, we have established supplier relationships with a number of well-known local and international healthcare and financial companies and medical academia. The following are some of the most recognized suppliers that the hospitals have established working relationships with:

Competition
 
We compete with two government-owned hospitals in the city of Harbin. We believe that we will be able to effectively compete with them because we:
 

● | Employ extensive marketing tactics to reach a large segment of customers, such as our special “Mobile clinics free medical service ” program, which provides free medical services to the Jiarun Hospital community and neighboring towns, thus providing an expanded customer base and expanding the influence of the marketing plan;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Provide advanced medical facilities and comfortable environments;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maintain the highest level of professional healthcare; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | Offer competitive prices for medical treatment and drugs and medications
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marketing
 
To increase our visibility, in April 2014, Jiarun purchased a clinicar. This mobile clinic promotes our business by providing free clinical services in Jiarun Hospital’s local community. With the hospital complex hospital already in use, Jiarun is able to further improve its healthcare services ability and expand its service coverage area to additional communities and towns. We also plan to send out our experts and medical team to communities to provide free public services, including consultation and medical services to attract customers.  
 
In the future, we plan to further strengthen our marketing efforts and improve our brand awareness through advertising on newspapers, magazines, and television. We will continue to focus on community medical service by maintaining a good relationship with our communities and providing quality medical service to the neighborhood residents. We understand that the key to success is to provide quality services.
 
PRC Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Business
 
According to the PRC Regulation of Healthcare Institutions, hospitals shall register with the Administration of Health of the local government to obtain the necessary business license for the provision of hospital services. We received our business license from Harbin City government in February of 2006. Other existing regulations having material effects on our business include those dealing with physician’s licensing, usage of medicine and injection, public security in health and medical advertising.
 
Healthcare providers in China are required to comply with many laws and regulations at the national and local government levels. These laws and regulations include the following:
 

● | We must register with and maintain an operating license from the local Administration of Health. We are subject to review by the local Administration of Health at an annual inspection.

Medical institutions that plan to operate medical examination businesses should apply to the NHFPC or its local branches for the approval of such medical examination business and register such business with the NHFPC or its local branches by including the business in their medical institution practicing licenses.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursuant to the Rules on Administration of Radiation-related Diagnose and Treatment issued in January 2006 by the NHFPC, medical institutions that plan to conduct radiation-related diagnosis and treatment businesses should apply to the NHFPC or its local branches and obtain radiation-related diagnosis and treatment licenses.

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An appraisal, conducted by an independent party, of the value of the company we propose to acquire.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insurance
 
Insurance companies in China offer limited business insurance products. Therefore we do not maintain either business liability insurance or medical malpractice insurance. While business liability and medical malpractice insurance is available to a limited extent in China, we have determined that the risks, cost of such insurance and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to purchase such insurance. Product or medical malpractice liability or uninsured damage to any of our medical centers or the medical equipment in our medical centers could result in significant disruption to the operation of our medical centers and result in a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Taxes
 
Enterprise income tax is defined under the Provisional Regulations of PRC Concerning Income Tax on Enterprises promulgated by the PRC. Income tax is payable by enterprises at a rate of 25% of their taxable income.
 
Jiarun is subject to the exemption provided for medical and health institutions that mainly provide medical services under the PRC’s regulation titled “To Replace the Business Tax with a Value-Added Tax Regulations【Cai Shui (2016) 36】” Attachment 3 Article 1 (7) of that regulation provides that hospitals, clinics and other medical institutions that provide medical services shall be exempt from value-added tax. The tax-exempt status will remain effective until notification from the tax bureau.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 669 employees, consisting of 239 doctors, 252 nurses and a drug management staff of 62, who are supported by 116 non-medical employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or similar collective bargaining organization.
