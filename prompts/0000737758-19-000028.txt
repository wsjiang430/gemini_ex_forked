ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
Introduction
The Toro Company was incorporated in Minnesota in 1935 as a successor to a business founded in 1914 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1983. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms "company," "Toro," "we," "our," or "us" refer to The Toro Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. Our executive offices are located at 8111 Lyndale Avenue South, Bloomington, Minnesota, 55420-1196, and our telephone number is (952)-888-8801. Our website for corporate and investor information is www.thetorocompany.com, which also contains links to our branded product sites. The information contained on our websites or connected to our websites is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "report") and should not be considered part of this report.
We design, manufacture, and market professional turf maintenance equipment and services, turf irrigation systems, landscaping equipment and lighting products, snow and ice management products, agricultural irrigation systems ("ag-irrigation"), rental, specialty and underground construction equipment, and residential yard and snow thrower products. We produced our first mower for golf course use in 1919 when we mounted five reel mowers on a Toro tractor, and we introduced our first lawn mower for residential use in 1938. We have continued to enhance our product lines over the more than 100 years we have been in business. We classify our operations into two reportable business segments: Professional and Residential. Our remaining activities are presented as "Other" due to their insignificance. These Other activities consist of earnings (loss) from our wholly-owned domestic distribution companies, corporate activities, and the elimination of intersegment revenues and expenses. Net sales of our reportable segments and Other activities accounted for the following percentages of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019: Professional, 77.8 percent; Residential, 21.1 percent; and Other, 1.1 percent.
Our products are advertised and sold worldwide through a network of distributors, dealers, mass retailers, hardware retailers, home centers, as well as online (direct to end-users) under the primary trademarks of Toro®, eXmark®, BOSS®, Ditch Witch®, American Augers®, Subsite®, HammerHead®, Trencor®, Radius®, Irritrol®, Unique Lighting Systems®, Rain Master®, Pope®, PERROT®, Hayter®, and Lawn-Boy®, most of which are registered in the United States ("U.S.") and/or in the primary countries outside the U.S. where we market our products branded under such trademarks. This report also contains trademarks, trade names, and service marks that are owned by other persons or entities, such as The Home Depot, Inc. ("The Home Depot").
We emphasize quality and innovation in our products, customer service, manufacturing, and marketing. We strive to provide well-built, dependable products supported by an extensive service network. We have committed funding for research, development, and engineering in order to improve and enhance 


existing products and develop new products. Through these efforts, we seek to be responsive to trends that may affect our target markets now and in the future. A significant portion of our net sales has historically been, and we expect will continue to be, attributable to new and enhanced products. We define new products as those introduced in the current and previous two fiscal years. We plan to continue to pursue targeted acquisitions using a disciplined approach that adds value while complementing our existing brands and product portfolio.
Our purpose is to help our customers enrich the beauty, productivity, and sustainability of the land. Our vision is to be the most trusted leader in solutions for the outdoor environment. Every day. Everywhere. Our mission is to deliver superior innovation and to deliver superior customer care.
Acquisition of The Charles Machine Works, Inc.
On April 1, 2019 ("closing date"), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated February 14, 2019 ("merger agreement"), we completed our acquisition of The Charles Machine Works, Inc. ("CMW"), a privately held Oklahoma corporation. CMW designs, manufactures, and markets a range of professional products to serve the underground construction market, including horizontal directional drills, walk and ride trenchers, compact utility loaders/skid steers, vacuum excavators, asset locators, pipe rehabilitation solutions, and after-market tools. CMW provides innovative product offerings that broadened and strengthened our Professional segment product portfolio and expanded our dealer network, while also providing a complementary geographic manufacturing footprint. The transaction was structured as a merger, pursuant to which a wholly-owned subsidiary of Toro merged with and into CMW, with CMW continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Toro. As a result of the merger, all of the outstanding equity securities of CMW were canceled and now only represent the right to receive the applicable consideration as described in the merger agreement. At the closing date, we paid preliminary merger consideration of $679.3 million that was subject to customary adjustments based on, among other things, the amount of actual cash, debt, and working capital in the business of CMW at the closing date. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we finalized such customary adjustments that resulted in an additional $5.7 million of merger consideration being paid and an aggregate merger consideration of $685.0 million ("purchase price"). We funded the purchase price for the acquisition by using a combination of cash proceeds from the issuance of borrowings under our unsecured senior term loan credit agreement and borrowings from our unsecured senior revolving credit facility. For additional information regarding the acquisition and the financing agreements utilized to fund the aggregate merger consideration, refer to Note 2, Business Combinations, and Note 6, Indebtedness, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


Products by Market
We strive to be a leader in adapting advanced technologies to products and services that provide innovative solutions for turf care maintenance, landscapes, agricultural fields, rental, specialty and underground construction, snow and ice management, and residential demands.

Our acquisition of CMW added a robust portfolio of Ditch Witch-branded mini stand-on skid steer products that are marketed and sold to contractors, municipalities, and other governmental entities through a comprehensive dealer network. Such Ditch Witch-branded mini stand-on skid steer products provide innovative and versatile solutions designed to increase efficiency and performance, as well as reduce manual labor for landscape and construction tasks in which end-users are unable to utilize larger equipment.
Snow and Ice Management Market
Products for the snow and ice management market are marketed mainly in North America under the BOSS brand and include snowplows, salt and sand spreaders, and related parts, as well as accessories for light and medium duty trucks, all-terrain vehicles, utility task vehicles, skid steers, and front-end loaders. These products are mainly sold through distributors and dealers, who then sell to end-users that in many cases are the same customers as those in our landscape contractor and sports fields and grounds markets, such as contractors, municipalities, and other governmental entities. Our BOSS-branded snow and ice management products are designed to provide innovative solutions to contractors, municipalities, and other governmental entities. One example of such innovation is our recently acquired and upgraded stand-on Snowrator®, which is designed to be a maneuverable, multi-tasking, and labor-saving snow removal and de-icing solution through its ability to make quick work of snow and ice covered sidewalks and other tight areas where large equipment is unable to reach and shoveling by hand was previously necessary.


Commercial Irrigation and Lighting Market
Turf irrigation products marketed under the Toro and Irritrol brands include rotors; sprinkler bodies and nozzles; plastic, brass, and hydraulic valves; drip tubing and subsurface irrigation; electric control devices; and wired and wireless rain, freeze, climate, and soil sensors. These products are installed by professional contractors and are designed for use in commercial and residential turf irrigation applications and can be installed into new systems or used to replace or retrofit existing systems. Most of the product lines are designed for professionally installed, underground automatic irrigation. Electric controllers activate valves and sprinklers in a typical irrigation system. Both the Toro and Irritrol brands have received the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") WaterSense award, as well as the EPA WaterSense certification for numerous irrigation controller families and models. In 2019, we continued to strengthen our SMRT Logic™ offering by adding the Rain Dial® to our line-up of compatible connected controllers. Professional contractors are now able to offer their customers various controller options between the Toro Evolution®, the Irritrol KD2 Series, and the Irritrol Rain Dial® Series to deliver irrigation and lighting control with the touch of a button using our SMRTScape App.
We manufacture and market lighting products under the Unique Lighting Systems brand name consisting of a line of high quality, professionally installed lighting fixtures and transformers for commercial and residential landscapes. Our lighting product line is offered through distributors and landscape contractors that also purchase our irrigation products. Our Light Logic™ remote control system provides operators with wireless scene control for landscape lighting and can upgrade existing systems with expanded control. The Light Logic™ Plus system is designed to deliver cloud-based control from any location using a web-enabled computer or device for outdoor landscape features such as lighting, irrigation, and pond or fountain pumps. In fiscal 2019, we expanded on our popular FLEX GOLD™ VIVID SERIES of LED lamps by adding color-changing options to go along with our white adjustable color temperature lamps that allow end-users to dial-in temperatures between 2700 – 6500K.
Agricultural-Irrigation Market
Products for the agricultural-irrigation market include products that are designed around efficient means of water application, including Aqua-Traxx® PBX drip tape, Neptune® flat emitter dripline, Blue Stripe® polyethylene tubing, BlueLine® drip line, and NGE® emitters, all used in agricultural and landscape applications. Population growth combined with limited resources for land and water, as well as water use restrictions, have continued to drive the need for more efficient irrigation solutions for agriculture, including our Aqua-Traxx Flow Control drip tape that is designed to allow growers to achieve water uniformity while retaining flexibility to adjust system flow rates when needed. In addition to these core products, we offer a full complement of design software, control devices, and connection options to complete the system. These products are sold mainly through dealers and distributors who then sell to end-users for use primarily in vegetable fields, fruit and nut 


orchards and vineyards. In fiscal 2019, we began implementing a "closed loop system" designed to address environmental sustainability by providing our customers with a mechanism by which they can return the resin that is used in our products from the field so that it can be reused in our manufacturing processes, thus reducing the impact of plastic usage and waste.
Residential Segment
We market our Residential segment products to homeowners through a variety of distribution channels, including outdoor power equipment distributors and dealers, mass retailers, hardware retailers, home centers, as well as online (direct to end-users). We also license our trademark on certain home solutions products as a means of expanding our brand presence.
Walk Power Mower Products
We manufacture and market numerous walk power mower models under our Toro and Lawn-Boy brand names, as well as the Hayter brand in the United Kingdom. Models differ as to cutting width, type of starter mechanism, method of grass clipping discharge, deck type, operational controls, and power sources, and are either self-propelled or operator-propelled push mowers. For the United Kingdom market, we offer a line of rear-roller walk power mowers, a design that provides a striped finish. In fiscal 2019, Toro launched a new line of products with the Flex-Force Power System® featuring 60V lithium-ion technology. This product line includes new Toro 22-inch Recycler® 60V walk power mowers. The mowers start with the push of a button, and the deck is made of steel instead of plastic for added durability. Other features include Toro's Personal Pace® self-propel system that is designed to automatically adjust to the user's walking speed, and SMARTSTOW®, which is designed to allow the mower to be stored upright, reducing the storage footprint by up to 70 percent. All of the products in the 60V Flex-Force Power System line feature Toro's lithium-ion smart batteries, which are designed to be interchangeable among products in the 60V Flex-Force Power System line and reduce emissions and noise.

We maintain sales offices in the U.S., Belgium, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, China, Italy, Poland, Germany, Spain, and France. New product development is pursued primarily in the U.S. with the intention of global distribution. Our net sales outside the U.S. were 23.1 percent, 24.6 percent, and 24.4 percent of total consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. For additional financial information regarding our international operations and geographical areas, and our reportable business segments, refer to Note 3, Segment Data, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
As a result of our international operations, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business. For additional information regarding our foreign currency exchange rate risk exposure, refer to Part II, Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Engineering and Research
We are committed to an ongoing engineering program dedicated to developing innovative new products and improvements in the quality and performance of existing products. However, a focus on innovation also carries certain risks that new technology could be slow to be accepted or not accepted by the marketplace. We attempt to mitigate these risks through our focus on, and commitment to, understanding our customers' needs and requirements. We invest time up front with customers, using "Voice of the Customer" tools, to help us develop innovative products that are intended to meet or exceed customer expectations. We use Design for Manufacturing and Assembly ("DFM/A") tools to ensure early manufacturing involvement in new product designs intended to reduce production costs. DFM/A focuses on reducing the number of parts required to assemble new products, as well as designing products to move more efficiently through the manufacturing process. We strive to make improvements to our new product development system as part of our continuing focus on Lean methods to shorten development time and reduce costs, while also improving quality.


Manufacturing and Production
In addition to most final assembly, we have strategically identified specific core manufacturing competencies for vertical integration, such as injection molding, extrusion, welding, stamping, fabrication, laser cutting, painting, machining, and aluminum die casting, and have chosen outside vendors to provide other services, where applicable. We design component parts in cooperation with our vendors, contract with them for the development of tooling, and subsequently enter into agreements with such vendors to purchase component parts manufactured using the tooling. We also have some agreements with third-party manufacturers to manufacture certain products on our behalf. In addition, our vendors regularly test new technologies to be applied in the design and production of component parts. Manufacturing operations include robotic and computer-automated equipment intended to speed production, reduce costs, and improve the quality, fit, and finish of our products. Operations are also designed to be flexible enough to accommodate product design changes that are necessary to respond to market conditions and changing customer requirements.
In order to utilize our manufacturing facilities and technology more efficiently and effectively, we pursue continuous improvements in our manufacturing processes with the use of Lean methods that are intended to streamline work and eliminate waste. We spend considerable effort to reduce manufacturing costs through Lean methods and process improvement, product and platform design, application of advanced technologies, enhanced environmental management systems, safety improvements, and improved supply-chain management.
Our Professional segment products are manufactured throughout the year. Our Residential segment lawn and garden products are also generally manufactured throughout the year. However, our Residential segment snow thrower products are manufactured in the summer and fall months but may be extended into the winter months, depending upon demand. Our products are tested in conditions and locations similar to those in which they are intended to be used. We use computer-aided design and manufacturing systems to shorten the time between initial concept and final production. DFM/A principles are used throughout the product development process to optimize product quality and reduce cost.
Our production levels and inventory management goals are based on estimates of wholesale and retail demand for our products, taking into account production capacity, labor availability, timing of shipments, and field inventory levels. Our production system utilizes Kanban, supplier pull, and build-to-order methodologies in our manufacturing facilities, as appropriate, for the business units they support in order to better align the production of our products to meet customer demand. We believe this has resulted in improved service levels for our participating suppliers, distributors, dealers, and other channels.
We periodically shut down production at our manufacturing facilities in order to allow for maintenance, rearrangement, 


capital equipment installation, seasonality, and as needed, to adjust for market demand and facility renovation projects.
Commodities, Components, Parts, and Accessories
We purchase commodities comprised of raw materials such as steel, aluminum, petroleum and natural gas-based resins, linerboard, and other materials, as well as components, such as engines, transmissions, transaxles, hydraulics, and electric motors, for use in our products. In addition, we are a purchaser of parts and accessories containing various commodities, including steel, aluminum, copper, lead, rubber, and others that are integrated into our end products. Our largest spend for commodities, components, parts, and accessories are generally for steel, engines, hydraulic components, transmissions, resin, aluminum, and electric motors, all of which we purchase from several suppliers around the world. We generally purchase commodities, components, parts, and accessories based upon market prices that are established with suppliers as part of the purchase process and generally attempt to obtain firm pricing from most of our suppliers for volumes consistent with planned production and estimates of wholesale and retail demand for our products. Most of the commodities, components, parts, and accessories utilized in our products are generally commercially available from a number of sources, and are in adequate supply. However, certain items are sourced from single suppliers. In fiscal 2019, similar to fiscal 2018, we experienced work stoppages as a result of supply chain challenges related to the availability or quality of commodities, components, parts, and accessories. 
Most of the commodities, components, parts, and accessories used in our manufacturing process and end-products, or to be sold as standalone end-products, are exposed to commodity cost changes, including, for example, as a result of inflation, deflation, changing prices, tariffs, and/or duties. We strategically work to mitigate any unfavorable impact as a result of changes to the cost of commodities, components, parts, and accessories that affect our product lines. Historically, we have mitigated, and we currently expect that we would mitigate, any commodity, components, parts, and accessories cost increases, in part, by collaborating with suppliers, reviewing alternative sourcing options, substituting materials, utilizing Lean methods, engaging in internal cost reduction efforts, utilizing tariff exclusions and duty drawback mechanisms, and increasing prices on some of our products, all as appropriate. Additionally, we enter into fixed-price contracts for future purchases of natural gas in the normal course of operations as a means to manage natural gas price risks. However, to the extent that commodity and component costs increase, as a result of inflation, tariffs, duties, or otherwise, and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers, or our suppliers are not able to honor such prices, we may experience a decline in our gross margins to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies to offset increases in commodity, component, parts, and accessories costs. 
In fiscal 2019, the average cost of commodities, components, parts, and accessories purchased, including the impact of inflation and tariff costs, was higher compared to the average 


cost of commodities, components, parts, and accessories purchased in fiscal 2018. We anticipate the average price of commodities, components, parts, and accessories, including the impact of inflation, deflation, tariff, and/or duty costs, in fiscal 2020 to be slightly lower than the average price paid for commodities, components, parts, and accessories during fiscal 2019. 
Service and Warranty
Our products are warranted to ensure customer confidence in design, workmanship, and overall quality. Warranty coverage is generally for specified periods of time and on select products' hours of usage, and generally covers parts, labor, and other expenses for non-maintenance repairs. Warranty coverage generally does not cover operator abuse or improper use. An authorized company distributor or dealer must perform warranty work. Distributors and dealers submit claims for warranty reimbursement and are credited for the cost of repairs, labor, and other expenses as long as the repairs meet our prescribed standards. Warranty expense is accrued at the time of sale based on the estimated number of products under warranty, historical average costs incurred to service warranty claims, the trend in the historical ratio of claims to sales, the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim, and other minor factors. Special warranty reserves are also accrued for major rework campaigns. Service support outside of the warranty period is provided by authorized distributors and dealers at the customer's expense. We sell extended warranty coverage on select products for a prescribed period after the original warranty period expires.
Product Liability
We have rigorous product safety standards and continually work to improve the safety and reliability of our products. We monitor for accidents and possible claims and establish liability estimates based on internal evaluations of the merits of individual claims. We purchase insurance coverage for catastrophic product liability claims for incidents that exceed our self-insured retention levels.
Patents and Trademarks
We own patents, trademarks, and trade secrets related to our products in the U.S. and certain countries outside the U.S. in which we conduct business. We expect to apply for future patents and trademarks, as appropriate, in connection with the development of innovative new products, services, and enhancements. Although we believe that, in the aggregate, our patents are valuable, and patent protection is beneficial to our business and competitive positioning, our patent protection will not necessarily deter or prevent competitors from attempting to develop similar products. We are not materially dependent on any one or more of our patents; however, certain Toro trademarks that contribute to our identity and the recognition of our products and services, including the Toro® name and logo, are an integral part of our business.
We regularly review certain patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") and international patent offices to help avoid potential liability with respect to others' 


patents. Additionally, we periodically review competitors' products to prevent possible infringement of our patents by others. We believe these activities help us minimize our risk of being a defendant in patent infringement litigation. We are currently involved in patent litigation cases where we are asserting our patents against competitors and defending against patent infringement assertions by others. Such cases are at varying stages in the litigation process.
Similarly, we periodically monitor various trademark registers and the market to prevent infringement of and damage to our trademarks by others. From time to time, we are involved in trademark oppositions where we are asserting our trademarks against third-parties who are attempting to establish rights in trademarks that are confusingly similar to ours. We believe these activities help minimize risk of harm to our trademarks, and help maintain distinct products and services that we believe are well regarded in the marketplace.
Seasonality
Shipments of our Residential segment products, which accounted for 21.1 percent of total consolidated net sales in fiscal 2019, are seasonal, with shipments of lawn and garden products occurring primarily between February and June, depending upon seasonal weather conditions and demand for our products. Shipments of snow thrower products occur primarily between July and January, depending upon pre-season demand, in-season snowfalls, and product availability. Opposite seasons in global markets in which we sell our Residential products somewhat moderate this seasonality of our Residential segment product sales.
Seasonality of Professional segment product sales also exists, but is tempered because the selling season in the Southern U.S. and our markets in the Southern hemisphere continue for a longer portion of the year than in Northern regions of the world. Our BOSS snow and ice management business offers a portfolio of counter-seasonal products in our Professional segment with our shipments of snow and ice management equipment occurring primarily between April and December, which can result in variability of shipment volumes depending upon pre-season demand, in-season snowfalls, and product availability. Additionally, CMW has historically been less seasonal than certain of our Professional segment businesses primarily due to its strong presence in the Southern U.S. markets and the inherent nature of the underground construction market being less impacted by seasonal factors.
Overall, our worldwide shipment volumes are historically the highest in our fiscal second quarter and retail demand is generally highest in our fiscal third quarter. Typically, our accounts receivable balances increase between January and April as a result of higher shipment volumes and extended payment terms made available to our customers. Accounts receivable balances typically decrease between May and December when payments are received. Our financing requirements are subject to variations due to seasonal changes in working capital levels, which typically increase in the first half of our fiscal year and decrease in the second half of our fiscal year. Seasonal cash requirements of our business are 


financed from a combination of cash flows from operations, cash on hand, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, as applicable.
The following table presents total consolidated net sales and net earnings for each fiscal quarter as a percentage of the total fiscal year:

Fiscal Years | 2019 | | 2018 
Quarter | Net Sales | | Net Earnings | | Net Sales | Net Earnings
First | 19 | % | | 22 | % | 21 | % | 8 | %
Second1,2 | 31 | % | | 42 | % | 33 | % | 48 | %
Third1,2 | 27 | % | | 22 | % | 25 | % | 29 | %
Fourth1 | 23 | % | | 14 | % | 21 | % | 15 | %


1 | Fiscal 2019 net sales and net earnings were impacted by our acquisition of CMW. Refer to Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and Note 2, Business Combinations, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding CMW and its impact to our fiscal 2019 Results of Operations.


2 | During fiscal 2019, CMW's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows were reported on a calendar month end. Accordingly, April 30, 2019 and July 31, 2019 were the quarterly period end dates closest to our quarterly fiscal periods ended May 3, 2019 and August 2, 2019, respectively. This reporting period difference did not have material impact on our Consolidated Results of Operations during our second and third fiscal quarters. For our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, the reporting period end for both CMW and Toro was October 31, 2019.

Effects of Weather
From time to time, weather conditions in particular geographic regions or markets may adversely or positively affect sales of some of our products and field inventory levels and result in a negative or positive impact on our future net sales and results of operations.
Working Capital
Our businesses are seasonally working capital intensive and require funding for purchases of commodities, components, parts, and accessories used in production of end-products and/or sold as standalone end-products; replacement parts inventory; payroll and other administrative costs; capital expenditures; establishment of new facilities; expansion and renovation of existing facilities; as well as for financing receivables from customers that are not financed with Red Iron Acceptance, LLC ("Red Iron"), our joint venture with TCF Inventory Finance, Inc. ("TCFIF"), or with other third-party financial institutions. Our strategy continues to place emphasis on improving asset utilization with a focus on reducing the amount of working capital in the supply chain, adjusting production plans, and maintaining or improving order replenishment and service levels to end-users. We fund our operations through a combination of cash flows from operations, cash on hand, and, as applicable, short-term and/or long-term debt, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Cash management is centralized, and 


intercompany financing is used, wherever possible, to provide working capital to wholly owned subsidiaries as needed. In addition, our revolving credit facility is available for additional working capital needs, acquisitions, or other investment opportunities, as applicable.
Distribution and Marketing
We market the majority of our products through 68 domestic and 140 international distributors, as well as a large number of equipment dealers, irrigation dealers and distributors, mass retailers, hardware retailers, home centers, and online (direct to end-users) in more than 129 countries worldwide. Our distribution systems are intended to assure quality of sales and market presence, as well as to provide effective after-purchase service and support.
Professional segment products are sold to distributors and dealers primarily for resale to golf courses, sports fields, industrial facilities, contractors, and government customers, and in some markets for resale to dealers. We sell some Professional segment products directly to government customers and municipalities, rental companies, and agricultural irrigation dealers, as well as to end-users in certain international markets. Select irrigation and lighting products are sold to professional irrigation and lighting distributors and dealers, and certain professional-grade retail irrigation products are sold to home centers. Products for the rental and specialty construction and underground construction markets are sold to dealers and rental companies. Landscape contractor turf products are also sold to dealers in certain regions of North America. Snow and ice management products are primarily sold to distributors and dealers for resale to contractors.
Residential segment products, such as walk power mowers, zero-turn radius riding mowers, and snow throwers, are generally sold to home centers, mass retailers, dealers, hardware retailers, as well as online (direct to end-users). In certain markets, these same products are sold to distributors for resale to hardware retailers and dealers. Home solutions products are primarily sold to home centers, mass retailers, and hardware retailers. Internationally, Residential segment products are sold to dealers and mass merchandisers in Australia, Canada, and select countries in Europe. In most other countries, Residential segment products are mainly sold to distributors for resale to dealers and mass retailers.
On November 30, 2018, during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed our acquisition of a Northeastern U.S. distribution company, refer to Note 2, Business Combinations. During fiscal 2017 and 2018, we owned one wholly-owned domestic distribution company. Our primary purpose in owning domestic distributorships is to improve operations and test and deploy new strategies and business practices that could be replicated by our independent distributors, as well as facilitating ownership transfers.
Our current marketing strategy is to maintain distinct brands and brand identification for Toro, eXmark, BOSS, Ditch Witch, American Augers, Trencor, Subsite, HammerHead, Radius, Unique Lighting Systems, Rain Master, Pope, PERROT, Hayter, and Lawn-Boy products.


10

Across our brands, we market our Professional segment and Residential segment products during the appropriate season through multiple channels, including digital and online media, radio, print, direct mail, email, television, and social media. Most of our advertising and marketing efforts emphasize our brands, products, features, and other valuable trademarks. Advertising is purchased by us, through our agency partners, as well as through cooperative programs with distributors, dealers, and retailers.
Customers and Customer Financing Arrangements
Overall, we believe that in the long-term we are not dependent on any single customer; and during fiscal 2019 and 2018, no customer accounted for 10.0 percent or more of our total consolidated gross sales. Historically, the Residential segment of our business has had significant sales to The Home Depot as a customer, which accounted for approximately 10.0 percent of our total consolidated gross sales in fiscal 2017. While the loss of any substantial customer could have a material adverse short-term impact on our business, we believe that our diverse distribution channels and customer base should reduce the long-term impact of any such loss.
Wholesale Financing
We are party to a joint venture with TCFIF, a subsidiary of TCF National Bank, established as Red Iron. The primary purpose of Red Iron is to provide inventory financing to certain distributors and dealers of certain of our products in the U.S. In addition, TCF Commercial Finance Canada, Inc. ("TCFCFC") provides inventory financing to dealers of certain of our products in Canada. Under these financing arrangements, down payments are not required, and depending on the finance program for each product line, finance charges are paid by us, shared between us and the distributor and/or the dealer, or paid by the distributor or dealer. Red Iron retains a security interest in the distributors' and dealers' financed inventories and such inventories are monitored regularly. Financing terms to the distributors and dealers require payment as the equipment, which secures the indebtedness, is sold to customers or when payment otherwise becomes due under the agreements between these financing entities and the distributors and dealers, whichever occurs first. Rates are generally indexed to LIBOR plus a fixed percentage that differs based on whether the financing is for a distributor or dealer. Rates may also vary based on the product that is financed. We also have agreements with other third-party financial institutions to provide floor plan financing to certain dealers and for certain products not financed through Red Iron, which include agreements with third-party financial institutions as a result of our acquisition of CMW.
Additionally, we continue to provide financing in the form of open account terms directly to home centers and mass retailers, general line irrigation dealers, certain international distributors and dealers, ag-irrigation dealers and distributors, government customers, and rental companies.


End-User Financing
We have agreements with third-party financing companies to provide lease-financing options to golf course, sports field and grounds equipment and underground construction equipment customers in the U.S, Canada, Australia, and select countries in Europe. The purpose of these agreements is to provide end-users of our products alternative financing options when purchasing our products.
Backlog of Orders
Our backlog of orders is dependent upon when customers place orders and is not necessarily an indicator of our expected results for our fiscal 2020 net sales. The approximate backlog of orders as of October 31, 2019 and 2018 was $112.5 million and $77.8 million, respectively, an increase of 44.6 percent. Backlog orders were higher at the end of fiscal 2019 compared to the end of fiscal 2018 as a result of our acquisition of CMW, partially offset by reduced backlog in certain of our Professional segment businesses due to higher field inventory levels for our Professional segment zero-turn riding mowers due to soft retail demand. For additional information regarding the acquisition of CMW, refer to Note 2, Business Combinations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We expect the existing backlog of orders will be filled in early fiscal 2020.
Competition
Our products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world. The principal competitive factors in our markets are product innovation, quality and reliability, pricing, product support and customer service, warranty, brand awareness, reputation, distribution, shelf space, and financing options. We believe we offer total solutions and full service packages with high quality products that have the latest technology and design innovations. In addition, by selling our products through a network of distributors, dealers, mass retailers, hardware retailers, home centers, as well as online (direct to end-users), users are offered comprehensive service support during and after the warranty period. We compete in many product lines with numerous manufacturers, some of which have substantially larger operations and financial resources than us. We believe that we have a competitive advantage because we manufacture a broad range of product lines, we are committed to product innovation and customer service, we have a strong history in and focus on professional and residential landscapes and CMW has a similar history in and focus in the underground construction industry, and our distribution channels position us well to compete in various markets.
Internationally, our Residential segment products face more competition because many foreign competitors design, manufacture, and market products in their respective countries. We experience this competition primarily in Europe. In addition, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar affect the price of our products in foreign markets, thereby impacting their competitiveness. We provide pricing support, as appropriate, to foreign customers to remain competitive in international markets.


Employees
During fiscal 2019, we employed an average of 8,237 employees. The total number of employees as of October 31, 2019 was 9,329. We consider our employee relations to be good. As of October 31, 2019, we had four collective bargaining agreements that expire in October 2020, March 2022, May 2022, and October 2022, covering approximately 13.0 percent of our total employees.
Environmental Matters and Other Governmental Regulation
We are subject to numerous international, federal, state, and other governmental laws, rules, and regulations relating to, among others, climate change; emissions to air, including Tier 4 or similar engine emission regulations; discharges to water; restrictions placed on water usage and water availability; product and associated packaging; use of certain chemicals; restricted substances, including "conflict minerals" disclosure rules; import and export compliance, including country of origin certification requirements; worker and product user health and safety; energy efficiency; product life-cycles; outdoor noise laws; and the generation, use, handling, labeling, collection, management, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, and other regulated materials. For example:

• | The U.S. EPA, the California Air Resources Board, and similar regulators in other U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we sell our products have phased in, or are phasing in, emission regulations setting maximum emission standards for certain equipment. Specifically, these agencies from time to time adopt increasingly stringent engine emission regulations. Following the EPA implementation of Tier 4 emission requirements applicable to diesel engines several years ago, China and the European Union ("EU") also have adopted similar regulations, and similar emission regulations are also being considered in other markets in which we sell our products.


• | The U.S. federal government, several U.S. states, and certain international jurisdictions in which we sell our products, including the EU and each of its member states, have implemented one or more of the following: (i) product life-cycle laws, rules, or regulations, which are intended to reduce waste and environmental and human health impact, and require manufacturers to label, collect, dispose, and recycle certain products, including some of our products, at the end of their useful life, including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment directive, which mandates the labeling, collection, and disposal of specified waste electrical and electronic equipment; (ii) the Restriction on the use of Hazardous Substances directive or similar substance level laws, rules, or regulations, which restrict the use of several specified hazardous materials in the manufacture of specific types of electrical and electronic equipment; (iii) the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals directive or similar substance level laws, rules, or regulations that require notification of use of certain chemicals, or ban or restrict the use of certain chemicals; (iv) country of origin


laws, rules, or regulations, which require certification of the geographic origin of our finished goods products and/or components used in our products through documentation and/or physical markings, as applicable; (v) energy efficiency laws, rules, or regulations, which are intended to reduce the use and inefficiencies associated with energy and natural resource consumption and require specified efficiency ratings and capabilities for certain products; (vi) outdoor noise laws, which are intended to reduce noise emissions in the environment from outdoor equipment; (vii) conflict minerals laws, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), which require specific procedures for the determination and disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as "conflict minerals," which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries; and (viii) other product substance restriction laws, some of which require certain labeling of products, such as California Proposition 65.

• | Our products, when used by residential users, may be subject to various federal, state, and international laws, rules, and regulations that are designed to protect consumers, including rules and regulations of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.

Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws, rules, and regulations, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of adopted or future laws, rules, and regulations on our business, properties or products. Such laws, rules, or regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses to achieve or maintain compliance, may require us to modify our products, may adversely affect the price of or demand for some of our products, and may ultimately affect the way we conduct our operations. Failure to comply with these current or future laws, rules, or regulations could result in harm to our reputation and/or could lead to fines and other penalties, including restrictions on the importation of our products into, or the sale of our products in, one or more jurisdictions until compliance is achieved.
We are also involved in the evaluation and environmental clean-up of a limited number of properties currently and previously owned. We do not expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Position or Results of Operations.
