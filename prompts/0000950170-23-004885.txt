 Item 1. Business.
 Development of the business
 FTC Solar, Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) was founded in 2017 and is incorporated in the state of Delaware. We are a global provider of advanced solar tracker systems, supported by proprietary software and value-added engineering services. Our mission is to provide differentiated products, software, and services that maximize energy generation and cost savings for our customers, and to help facilitate the continued growth and adoption of solar power globally. Trackers significantly increase the amount of solar energy produced at a solar installation by moving solar panels throughout the day to maintain an optimal orientation relative to the sun. Our primary tracker system is currently marketed under the Voyager brand name (“Voyager”). Voyager is a next-generation two-panel in-portrait ("2P") single-axis tracker solution that we believe offers industry-leading performance and ease of installation. In September 2022, we announced the introduction of Pioneer, a new and differentiated one module-in-portrait ("1P") solar tracker solution that allows for a pile count reduction per megawatt compared to similar industry-leading solutions, as well as providing what we believe to be other benefits, such as faster assembly capability, giving potential customers the possibility for increased flexibility and additional cost savings. We have also launched a new solution for thin-film modules, filling a gap in our offering for certain U.S. modules. We have a team of dedicated renewable energy professionals with significant project installation experience focused on delivering cost reductions to our U.S. and worldwide clients across the solar project development and construction cycle. The Company is headquartered in Austin, Texas, and has international subsidiaries in Australia, China, India and South Africa.


In April 2021, we completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of 19,840,000 shares of our common stock receiving proceeds of $241.2 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, but before offering costs, and began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “FTCI”. Prior to the completion of the IPO, the board of directors and stockholders approved an approximately 8.25-for-1 forward stock split (the “Forward Stock Split”) of the Company’s shares of common stock which became effective on April 28, 2021. Proceeds from the IPO were used for general corporate purposes, with $54.2 million used to purchase an aggregate of 4,455,384 shares of our common stock, including shares resulting from the settlement of certain vested restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and exercise of certain options in connection with the IPO at the IPO price, less underwriting discounts and commissions.
 On June 14, 2022, we closed on the acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of Shanghai Han Xiang New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. ("HX Tracker"), a China-based supplier of 1P tracker systems, in order to extend our international market presence. The purchase price included approximately $3.5 million of cash, paid in July 2022, and the issuance in June 2022 of 1,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock valued at approximately $4.4 million. In addition, as part of the purchase price, we paid the existing debt of HX Tracker owed to the previous owners, totaling approximately $0.8 million as of the acquisition date during the third quarter of 2022. In addition, certain former employees of HX Tracker, who became employees of the Company were eligible to receive up to 2.2 million RSUs which will vest over a two to four-year period based on future performance or service conditions. The goodwill recognized as part of the acquisition is attributable to expected synergies in the acquired company's tracker offering and cross selling opportunities in various international markets and is not deductible for tax purposes. Certain former key employees of HX Tracker became employees of the Company following the closing.
 On July 1, 2022, we closed on an acquisition of certain assets from Standard Sun, Inc. relating to their pile testing and equipment installation business. Total purchase price was approximately $0.8 million. Two employees of this business became employees of the Company following the acquisition.
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act. Under the JOBS Act, we elected to use the allowed extended transition period to delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies.
 Description of the business
 We currently offer trackers and software solutions targeting the utility-scale solar energy markets to current and potential customers in the United States, Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, South Africa and Australia. Our Voyager tracking system is built upon a self-powered, 2P design utilizing a 60-meter independent row architecture, which we believe provides numerous advantages to our customers. In addition, our recently announced Pioneer 1P solar tracker solution leverages technological advantages of Voyager and provides what we believe to be numerous cost savings benefits to our potential customers relative to other 1P solutions including faster assembly capability, a reduced pile count and embedment depth, and higher slope tolerance. In September 2022, we announced that Pioneer had been selected by a customer for use on multiple future project sites to supply a target of at least 500 megawatts of power.
 In addition, in August 2022, we entered into an agreement with a solar contracting company to provide our Voyager 2P solar tracking solution to the distributed generation market for sites providing under 20 megawatts of power in North America. We and our partner company are targeting multiple segments with this turnkey solution offering, including commercial and industrial, community solar programs, projects for independent power producers and smaller one-off projects for sectors such as agriculture.
 We also continued to expand our international footprint during 2022 with our acquisition of HX Tracker, as described above, and receipt of our first project awards in Kenya, South Africa, Malaysia and Thailand and our largest project award to date in Australia, a 128 megawatt hybrid solar project.
 Our customers include project developers, solar asset owners and engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) contractors that design and build solar energy projects. The vast majority of our revenue in the periods presented in this Annual Report was attributable to sales in the United States and Australia.
We currently operate in one business segment and derive our revenue primarily from the sale of: (i) solar trackers and customized components of solar tracker systems, (ii) individual parts of solar tracker systems for certain specific transactions, (iii) shipping and handling services, (iv) term-based software licenses, (v) maintenance and support services for the term-based software licenses, and (vi) subscription services.
We report both product and service revenue in our consolidated financial statements. Product revenue includes revenue from the sale of our solar tracking systems and customized components of those systems, individual part sales for certain specific transactions, and sale of term-based software licenses. Service revenue includes revenue from shipping and handling services, subscription fees from licensing subscription services, and maintenance and support services in connection with the term-based software licenses.

We incur costs associated with the revenues generated related to (i) the raw materials used in our solar tracker systems, including parts and components, (ii) personnel costs attributable to procurement, installation and delivery of finished products and services, (iii) freight and delivery, (iv) product warranty, (v) insurance, and (vi) customer support.
 We currently outsource all manufacturing to contract manufacturing partners who rely largely on raw materials obtained from international sources. Based on the U.S. dollar amount of purchase orders we issued during the year ended December 31, 2022, the percentage of our spending involves partners located in the following countries:
 
Vendor location | Year ended December 31, 2022 | 
Thailand | | 52 | %
China | | 20 | %
United States | | 16 | %
India | | 12 | %
Total | | 100 | %

 We are focused on growing our U.S. manufacturing supply partners in 2023 in order to reduce lead times for our customers, as well as other potential benefits. As an example, in February 2023, we entered into an agreement with Taihua New Energy (Thailand) Co., LTD, a leading steel fabricator, for the creation of Alpha Steel LLC, a manufacturing partnership that will include a facility to be based in Sealy, Texas that will be dedicated to producing steel components, including torque tubes, for utility scale projects. For further discussion, see Note 22 "Subsequent events" included in our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
 We, and our contract manufacturing partners, were impacted by global logistics issues and increasing costs to obtain and deliver materials during the last nine months of 2021 and through the first nine months of 2022. Although overall transportation costs are still higher than pre-COVID-19 pandemic rates, there has been a decline in recent months in costs for both charter vessels and in the premium container market. In addition, steel prices also started to stabilize and decline during the fourth quarter of 2022. We continue to focus on improving product margins by seeking ways to further reduce our costs.
 Market factors
 Our global market opportunity is driven by two primary factors: overall growth in utility-scale solar projects and the increased usage of trackers as the preferred mounting system in utility-scale solar projects.
 Governments across the globe have established policies to support a transition away from fossil fuels and towards low-carbon forms of energy, such as solar power. In the United States, various states have implemented Renewable Portfolio Standards, which require a specified percentage of the electricity sold by utilities to come from renewable sources by a certain date, as described further below. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Biden on August 16, 2022, expanded and extended the tax credits and other tax benefits available to solar energy projects and the solar energy supply chain, however we note that implementing regulations for this law are still in process, which creates uncertainty about the extent of its impact on our Company and the solar energy industry. Other policies and actions of the federal government have had a negative impact on demand through creation of uncertainty as to the ability to import solar modules into the United States, as discussed below. Globally, renewable energy support has accelerated since the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which became effective in 2016. These factors, along with efficiency improvements and cost reductions in the underlying photovoltaic cell technology used in solar energy production, have contributed to solar energy becoming the fastest growing and most affordable source of new electricity in America, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
 Solar trackers have been gaining market share versus fixed-tilt mounting systems due to their ability to optimize energy production, accommodate more varied terrain and offer a more attractive return on investment. The United States currently represents the largest portion of the solar tracker market while continued growth is expected in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia. We believe we are well positioned to benefit from the accelerating adoption of both one and two-panel in-portrait tracker systems, bifacial panels and larger-format or higher-powered bifacial panels.
 Our growth strategy is based on (i) increasing our market share in the United States, (ii) continuing our international expansion, (iii) enhancing our tracker product offerings, (iv) reducing our operating costs through operating leverage, (v) expanding our software offering by supporting operating, maintenance and lifecycle management and improving the attachment rate of enhanced software to tracker sales, (vi) expanding our sales to the distributed generation market, and (vii) identifying additional strategic acquisitions.


Government policies and regulations
 Federal, state, local and foreign government bodies provide incentives to owners, end-users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments, payments of renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and manufacturing of specific solar components, as well as exclusions of solar energy systems from property tax assessments.
 The most notable incentive program impacting our U.S. business has been the investment tax credit ("ITC") for solar energy projects, which allows taxpayers to offset their U.S. federal income tax liability by a certain percentage of their cost basis in solar energy systems placed in service for commercial use. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Biden on August 16, 2022, expanded and extended the tax credits and other tax benefits available to solar energy projects and the solar energy supply chain. ITCs have been extended for such projects through at least 2032 and, depending on the location of a particular project and its ability to satisfy certain labor and domestic content requirements, the ITC percentage can range between 30% and 50%. Manufacturers of specific solar components are also now eligible to claim production tax credits as an alternative to the ITC. Implementing regulations for this law are still in process.
 Renewable portfolio standards (“RPS”) are a set of policies designed to increase the use of renewable energy sources for electricity generation. In general, RPS set a minimum requirement for the share of electricity supply that comes from designated renewable energy resources by a certain date or year. According to information provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, as of November 2022, 36 states and the District of Columbia had established an RPS or renewable energy goal. In 12 of those states and the District of Columbia, the requirement is for 100% clean energy by 2050 or earlier. A common feature of RPS policies is a renewable electricity credit trading system that reduces the cost to comply with the RPS.
 Other policies and actions of the federal government have had a negative impact on demand through creation of uncertainty as to the ability to import solar modules into the United States.
 The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act ("UFLPA") was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Biden on December 23, 2021. The UFLPA establishes a rebuttable presumption that the importation of any goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China, or that are produced by certain entities, is prohibited by Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and that such goods, wares, articles, and merchandise are not entitled to entry to the United States. U.S. Customs and Border Protection ("CBP") began implementing the provisions of UFLPA on June 21, 2022, resulting in new rules for solar module importers and reviews by CBP. There continues to be uncertainty in the market around achieving full compliance with UFLPA for the importation of solar modules, whether related to sufficient traceability of materials or other factors.
 On March 25, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce, in response to a petition by Auxin Solar, Inc., initiated an investigation of claims related to alleged circumvention of U.S. antidumping and countervailing duties ("AD/CVD") by solar manufacturers in certain Southeast Asian countries in an effort to determine whether or not solar cells and/or modules made in those Southeast Asian nations use parts originating from China in order to circumvent the AD/CVD tariffs. On June 6, 2022, President Biden issued an Executive Order allowing U.S. solar deployers the ability to import solar modules and cells from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam free from certain duties for 24 months, along with other incentives designed to accelerate U.S. domestic production of clean energy technologies.
 Since 2016, CBP has issued a number of withhold release orders ("WRO") directed at forced labor in China, including WROs directed specifically at activity in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. In addition, recent WROs related to polysilicon requires panel importers to demonstrate that polysilicon used in their panels has not been sourced using forced labor. To date, CBP has used the WROs to detain solar panels, which has disrupted the U.S. solar installation market and caused additional uncertainty on future projects.
 These policies and actions have resulted in some developers deferring projects due to the uncertainty of panel supply and costs, which has negatively impacted our 2022 revenues and cash flows and may continue to negatively impact our anticipated revenues and our cash flows in 2023.
 Environmental, social and governance (“ESG”)
 Our mission and core values -
 Our mission is to drive energy independence through effective and efficient solar engineering and innovation.


The following three central pillars are what we were founded on and what currently guides our company:
 •Sustainability, as we were born from sustainable products
 •Innovation in the energy transition
 •Asset-light to provide efficient and flexible capacity
 We accelerate the adoption of renewable energy by reducing the cost of construction, simplifying the installation process and improving the energy yield of solar projects, thus supporting the transition away from fossil fuels. We make solar energy generation more efficient and attainable with our software, engineering and differentiated products.
 We are committed to the following core values in the way we do business:
 •Integrity - We do the right thing. We are humble and listen to new ideas. We respect our customers and our teammates.
 •Accountability - We are all accountable and act with urgency. We are transparent and deliver on our commitments. We come together to solve problems.
 •Innovation - We collaborate to create world class solutions. We foster a learning culture. We turn great ideas into our future.
 •Excellence - We are committed to high quality. We plan well and execute flawlessly. We are focused on results.
 Environmental management -
 We are committed to protecting our environment for the benefit of current and future generations. We design our products and operations to reduce environmental impacts and maximize environmental savings.
 Beginning in August 2018, several of our functional groups achieved ISO 14001:2015 certification through third-party assurance. The standard from the International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") details the requirements for an environmental management system that we use to measure and manage our environmental performance. Specifically, our tracker business is ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018 certified, and through Intertek has met the standards necessary to qualify for the UL certification for solar trackers. Our contract manufacturing partners also undergo a qualification process to remain on our approved vendor list, which includes a review and assessment of their environmental performance.
 In 2021, we performed a greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions accounting exercise to assess emissions across our global operations, focusing initially on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from our owned operations, including purchased electricity and heating. Through this exercise, we identified strategic and operational opportunities to reduce emissions and confirmed most of our GHG emissions are associated with our supply chain.
 We continue to shift away from nonrenewable materials, especially those derived from petroleum, such as plastics and Styrofoam, and have established a waste management program to promote collection and processing of recyclable materials within the organization, including seeking out trusted electronics recycling partners. Additionally, we designed our solar tracker offerings to minimize steel content, to require no specialized tools and to reduce labor hours needed for installation and maintenance.
 Social -
 In addition to providing training to our employees and regular reinforcement of our core values, we have also invested resources in developing a workforce where our teams can enjoy a collaborative environment.
Personal health and safety of each employee is of utmost importance, and we work to continually improve our safety policies and procedures. Our employees do not directly perform solar installations, but we consider the safety of the on-site installers when designing our products and installation procedures.
 ISO 45001 is a framework that was developed to address occupational health and safety risks in the workplace using best practices from international labor standards and regulatory agencies. As noted above, we hold ISO 45001:2018 certification and use a separate but aligned qualification process with our contract manufacturing partners.
 We provide competitive medical, dental, vision, life and disability insurance and savings plan benefits to our employees and regularly publicly recognize individual and team work and innovations in company-wide meetings.


Governance -
 We are governed by a board of directors comprising eight members, including five independent members. Our board has established an audit committee, compensation committee and nominating and governance committee, consisting solely of independent members, to advise the full board on various matters. The audit committee will also periodically meet separately with our independent auditors, without the presence of management, to discuss any matters of importance or concern to our auditors. Additionally, our Director of Internal Audit organizationally reports directly to the audit committee.
 Our executive officers serve at the discretion of our board of directors and hold office until his or her successor is duly appointed or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. There are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive officers. The following table sets forth the names, ages and positions of our executive officers as of the date of this Annual Report:
 
Name | Age | | Position
Sean Hunkler | | 60 | | President and Chief Executive Officer, Director
Sasan Aminpour | | 59 | | Chief Operating Officer(a) 
Phelps Morris | | 49 | | Chief Financial Officer 
Patrick M. Cook | | 39 | | Chief Commercial Officer 
Nagendra Cherukupalli | | 63 | | Chief Technology Officer 
Kristian Nolde | | 45 | | Vice President, Marketing and Strategy 
(a) - Effective March 1, 2023 | | | 

 In addition to our executive officers, our global executive leadership team also includes other individuals, such as our Chief Accounting Officer, CIO & Chief Data Officer, Chief People Officer, General Counsel and certain others. Additional biographical information on our executive officers will be set forth in the 2023 Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference.
Outlined below under "Human capital resources", is information on the diversity in gender, age and ethnicity of our board of directors, executive leadership team and employee population as of December 31, 2022.
 Climate change
 Climate change has primarily impacted our business operations by increasing demand for solar power generation and, as a result, for use of our products. While climate change has not resulted in any material negative impact to our operations to date, we recognize the risk of disruptions to our supply chain due to extreme weather events. This has led us to expand the diversity of our supplier base and to partner with more local suppliers to reduce shipping and transportation needs. We are also increasingly partnering with larger scale steel producers rather than smaller suppliers to facilitate scaling of our operations while remaining conscious of the environmental impacts of steel manufacturing as the regulatory landscape around these high-emitting industries evolves.
 We also attempt to mitigate the climate-related risks from the use of our products by designing our equipment and systems to have a high-slope tolerance and wind mitigation capabilities, while at the same time reducing the required foundation/pile count needed. This allows our trackers to be installed in increasingly hostile environments with minimal disturbance to the surrounding land.
 Seasonality
 Our revenue may be impacted by seasonality and variability related to the timing of construction activity. Based on historical experience, we have experienced lower levels of customer purchasing during winter months in cold-weather climates as it is more costly to our customers to set foundations when the ground is frozen.
Competition
 The tracker industry is highly specialized and dominated by a relatively small number of companies. Our direct tracker competitors include Array Technologies, Inc. and Nextracker Inc. We also compete indirectly with manufacturers of fixed-tilt mounting systems. We compete on the basis of product performance and features, total cost of ownership (usually measured by the levelized cost of energy), reliability and duration of product warranty, sales, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, training, customer support and the ability to identify, hire and retain qualified personnel.
 Several of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger than we are and may have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, distribution and customer support resources, as well as broader brand recognition and greater market penetration, especially in certain markets.
