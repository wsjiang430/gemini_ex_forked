Item 1. Business
GENERAL
Medley Capital Corporation is a non-diversified closed end management investment company incorporated in Delaware that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”).  We completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) and commenced operations on January 20, 2011. The Company has elected, and intends to qualify annually, to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with our first taxable year as a corporation. We are externally managed and advised by our investment adviser, MCC Advisors, pursuant to an investment management agreement.
Our investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by lending directly to privately held middle market companies, primarily through directly originated transactions to help these companies expand their business, refinance and make acquisitions. Our investment portfolio generally consists of senior secured first lien term loans, senior secured second lien term loans, preferred equity and common equity. In connection with some of our investments, we receive warrants or other equity participation features which we believe will increase the total investment returns.
We believe the middle-market private debt market is undergoing structural shifts that are creating significant opportunities for non-bank lenders and investors. The underlying drivers of these structural changes include: reduced participation by banks in the private debt markets, particularly within the middle-market, and demand for private debt created by committed and uninvested private equity capital. We focus on taking advantage of this structural shift by lending directly to companies that are underserved by the traditional banking system and generally seek to avoid broadly marketed investment opportunities. We source investment opportunities primarily through direct relationships with financial sponsors, as well as financial intermediaries such as investment banks and commercial banks.
Our investment activities are managed by our investment adviser, MCC Advisors, which is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”). MCC Advisors is an affiliate of Medley and is based in New York. Our Investment Team, which is provided for by MCC Advisors, is responsible for sourcing investment opportunities, conducting industry research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring our investments and monitoring our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis.  MCC Advisors’ team draws on its expertise in lending to predominantly privately held borrowers in a range of sectors, including industrials, and transportation, energy and natural resources, financials and real estate.  In addition, MCC Advisors seeks to diversify our portfolio of loans by company type, asset type, transaction size, industry and geography.
Our Investment Team has extensive experience in the credit business, including originating, underwriting, principal investing and loan structuring. Our Adviser, through Medley, has access to over 60 employees, including over 30 investment, origination and credit management professionals, and over 30 operations, marketing and distribution professionals, each with extensive experience in their respective disciplines. We believe that MCC Advisors’ disciplined and consistent approach to origination, portfolio construction and risk management should allow it to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns for Medley Capital.
MCC Advisors also serves as our administrator and provides us with office space, equipment and other office services. The responsibilities of our administrator include overseeing our financial records, preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC and generally monitoring the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others.
As a BDC, we are required to comply with regulatory requirements, including limitations on our use of debt. We are permitted to, and expect to continue to, finance our investments through borrowings. However, as a BDC, we are only generally allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% (or 150% if certain requirements under the 1940 Act are met) after such borrowing. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.
As of September 30, 2019, the Company’s asset coverage was 184.2% after giving effect to leverage and therefore the Company’s asset coverage is below 200%, the minimum asset coverage requirement under the 1940 Act. As a result, the Company is prohibited from making distributions to stockholders, including the payment of any dividend, and may not employ further leverage until the Company’s asset coverage is at least 200% after giving effect to such leverage.
Opportunities for co-investments may arise when MCC Advisors or an affiliated investment adviser becomes aware of investment opportunities that may be appropriate for the Company, other clients, or affiliated funds. On November 25, 2013, the Company obtained an exemptive order from the SEC that permits us to participate in negotiated co-investment transactions with certain affiliates, each of whose investment adviser is Medley, LLC or an 
1

investment adviser controlled by Medley, LLC in a manner consistent with our investment objective, strategies and restrictions, as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors (the “Prior Exemptive Order”). On March 29, 2017, the Company, MCC Advisors and certain other affiliated funds and investment advisers received an exemptive order (the “Exemptive Order”) that supersedes the Prior Exemptive Order and allows affiliated registered investment companies to participate in co-investment transactions with us that would otherwise have been prohibited under Section 17(d) and 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d-1 thereunder. On October 4, 2017, the Company, MCC Advisors and certain of our affiliates received an exemptive order that supersedes the Exemptive Order (the “Current Exemptive Order”) and allows, in addition to the entities already covered by the Exemptive Order, Medley LLC and its subsidiary, Medley Capital LLC, to the extent they hold financial assets in a principal capacity, and any direct or indirect, wholly or majority owned subsidiary of Medley LLC that is formed in the future, to participate in co-investment transactions with us that would otherwise be prohibited by either or both of Sections 17(d) and 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act. The terms of the Current Exemptive Order are otherwise substantially similar to the Exemptive Order. Co-investment under the Current Exemptive Order is subject to certain conditions, including the condition that, in the case of each co-investment transaction, our board of directors determines that it would be in our best interest to participate in the transaction. However, neither we nor the affiliated funds are obligated to invest or co-invest when investment opportunities are referred to us or them.
In situations where co-investment with other funds managed by MCC Advisors or its affiliates is not permitted or appropriate, such as when there is an opportunity to invest in different securities of the same issuer or where the different investments could be expected to result in a conflict between our interests and those of other MCC Advisors clients, MCC Advisors will need to decide which client will proceed with the investment. MCC Advisors will make these determinations based on its policies and procedures, which generally require that such opportunities be offered to eligible accounts on an alternating basis that will be fair and equitable over time. Moreover, except in certain circumstances, we will be unable to invest in any issuer in which a fund managed by MCC Advisors or its affiliates has previously invested. Similar restrictions limit our ability to transact business with our officers or directors or their affiliates.
On March 26, 2013, our wholly owned subsidiary, Medley SBIC LP (“SBIC LP”), a Delaware limited partnership, received a license from the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) to operate as a Small Business Investment Company (“SBIC”) under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Company Act of 1958, as amended. Effective July 1, 2019, SBIC LP surrendered its SBIC license and changed its name to Medley Small Business Fund, LP (“Medley Small Business Fund”). In addition, Medley SBIC GP, LLC changed its name to Medley Small Business Fund GP, LLC. See Note 5 for further information.
Our principal executive office is located at 280 Park Avenue, 6th Floor East, New York, NY 10017 and our telephone number is (212) 759-0777.
Formation Transactions
Medley Capital BDC LLC (the “LLC”), a Delaware limited liability company, was formed on April 23, 2010.
Prior to the pricing of our IPO, Medley Opportunity Fund LP (“MOF LP”), a Delaware limited partnership, and Medley Opportunity Fund, Ltd. (“MOF LTD”), a Cayman Islands exempted limited liability company, transferred all of their respective interests in six loan participations in secured loans to middle market companies with a combined fair value, plus payment-in-kind interest and accrued interest thereon, of approximately $84.95 million (the “Loan Assets”) to MOF I BDC LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“MOF I BDC”) in exchange for membership interests in MOF I BDC.  As a result, MOF LTD owned approximately 90% of the outstanding MOF I BDC membership interests and MOF LP owned approximately 10% of the outstanding MOF I BDC membership interests. On January 18, 2011, each of MOF LTD and MOF LP contributed their respective MOF I BDC membership interests to the LLC in exchange for LLC membership interests. As a result, MOF I BDC became a wholly owned subsidiary of the LLC.
On January 18, 2011, the LLC converted into Medley Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation.  As a result, MOF LTD and MOF LP’s LLC membership interests were exchanged for 5,759,356 shares of the Company’s common stock at $14.75 per share.  On January 20, 2011, the Company filed an election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act.
On January 20, 2011, we priced our IPO and sold 11,111,112 shares of common stock at $12.00 per share.  On February 24, 2011, an additional 450,000 shares of our common stock were issued at a price of $12.00 per share pursuant to the partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option.  Net of underwriting fees and estimated offering costs, the Company raised a total of approximately $129.6 million. Our shares began trading on January 20, 2011 on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “MCC.”
Investment Process Overview
We view our investment process as consisting of three distinct phases described below:
Sourcing and Origination MCC Advisors sources investment opportunities through access to a network of contacts developed in the financial services and related industries by Medley. It is the Adviser’s responsibility to identify specific opportunities, to refine opportunities through rigorous due diligence of the underlying facts and circumstances while remaining flexible and responsive to client’s needs. With over 30 investment professionals based in New York involved in sourcing and origination for MCC Advisors, each investment professional is able to maintain long-standing relationships and responsibility for a specified market.
An investment pipeline is maintained to manage all prospective investment opportunities and is reviewed weekly by the Investment Committee of MCC Advisors (“Investment Committee”). The purpose of the investment pipeline, which is comprised of all prospective investment opportunities at various stages of due diligence and approval, is to evaluate, monitor and approve all of our investments, subject to the oversight of our Investment Committee. 
Credit Evaluation We utilize a systematic, consistent approach to credit evaluation developed by Medley, with a particular focus on determining the value of a business in a downside scenario. The key criteria that we consider and attributes that we seek include: (i) strong and resilient underlying business fundamentals; (ii) a substantial equity cushion in the form of capital ranking junior in the right of payment to our investment; (iii) sophisticated management teams with a minimum operating history of two years; (iv) a conclusion that overall downside risk is manageable; (v) collateral support in the form of accounts receivable, inventory, machinery, equipment, real estate, IP, overall enterprise value and other assets; and (vi) limited requirements 
2

for future financing beyond the proposed commitment. The first review of an opportunity is conducted using the above-mentioned analysis to determine if the opportunity meets MCC Advisors' general investment criteria. The next three reviews performed by the Investment Committee include the following: (1) an Early Read Memo, (2) a Green Light Memo, and (3) Investment Committee approval memo. MCC Advisors maintains a rigorous in-house due diligence process. Prior to making each investment, MCC Advisors subjects each potential portfolio company to an extensive credit review process, including analysis of market and operational dynamics as well as both historical and projected financial information. Areas of additional focus include management or sponsor experience, industry and competitive dynamics, and tangible asset values. Background checks and tax compliance checks are typically required on all portfolio company management teams.
Our due diligence process typically entails:


• | negotiation and execution of a term sheet;


• | on-site visits;


• | interviews with management, employees, customers and vendors;


• | review of loan documents and material contracts, as applicable;


• | obtaining background checks on all principals/partners/founders; 


• | completing customer and supplier calls;


• | review of tax and accounting issues related to a contemplated capital structure;


• | developing a financial model with sensitivity analysis that includes a management case, expected case and downside case;


• | receiving third party reports such as environmental, appraisal and consulting reports, as applicable.

Monitoring MCC Advisors views active portfolio monitoring as a vital part of our investment process. MCC Advisors utilizes an investment management system, which maintains a centralized, dynamic electronic reporting system which houses, organizes and archives all portfolio data by investment. This is the primary system that tracks all changes to investment terms and conditions. On a quarterly basis, the asset management team produces a report for each investment within the portfolio by summarizing the investment’s general information, terms and structure, financial performance, covenant package, and business updates. This feature enables MCC Advisors to track the history of every investment, while maintaining access to the most recent reporting information available, ensuring accurate reporting of the investment.
MCC Advisors will typically require portfolio companies to adhere to certain affirmative covenants requiring the following reports:
 
 | monthly or quarterly financial statements |  | annual audits and management letters 
 | monthly or quarterly covenant certificates |  | quarterly industry updates 
 | monthly or quarterly management discussion & analysis |  | quarterly customer and supplier concentration updates
 | monthly or quarterly bank statements |  | quarterly backlog/pipeline reports 
 | annual insurance certificates |  | annual budgets and forecasts. 

MCC Advisors holds regular portfolio reviews where the Investment Committee reviews each transaction in detail and reassesses the risk rating presently assigned.

Rating Criteria In addition to external risk management research and internal monitoring tools, we use an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. We use a five-level numeric rating scale. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating:
3


CreditRating | Definition 
1 | | Investments that are performing above expectations. 
2 | | Investments that are performing within expectations, with risks that are neutral or favorable compared to risks at the time of origination. 
 | | All new loans are rated ‘2’. 
3 | | Investments that are performing below expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where no loss of interest, dividend or principal is expected. 
 | | Companies rated ‘3’ may be out of compliance with financial covenants, however, loan payments are generally not past due. 
4 | | Investments that are performing below expectations and for which risk has increased materially since origination. 
 | | Some loss of interest or dividend is expected but no loss of principal. 
 | | In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due).
5 | | Investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since origination. 
 | Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent.
 | Some loss of principal is expected. 

Investment Committee

The purpose of the Investment Committee, which is comprised of a minimum of three members selected from senior members of MCC Advisors’ Investment Team, is to evaluate and approve all of our investments. The Investment Committee process is intended to bring the diverse experience and perspectives of the committee’s members to the analysis and consideration of each investment. The Investment Committee serves to provide investment consistency and adherence to our core investment philosophy and policies. The Investment Committee also determines appropriate investment sizing and suggests ongoing monitoring requirements.

In addition to reviewing investments, Investment Committee meetings serve as a forum to discuss credit views and outlooks. Potential transactions and deal flow are reviewed on a regular basis.  Members of the investment team are encouraged to share information and views on credits with the Investment Committee early in their analysis.  We believe this process improves the quality of the analysis and assists the investment team members to work more efficiently.

Each transaction is presented to the Investment Committee in a formal written report. All of our new investments and the exit or sale of an existing investment must be approved by a majority vote of the Investment Committee, although unanimous agreement is sought.

Investment Structure

Once we have determined that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for investment, we work with the management of that company and its other capital providers to structure an investment.  We negotiate among these parties to agree on how our investment is expected to perform relative to the other capital in the portfolio company’s capital structure.
We structure our investments, which typically have maturities of three to seven years, as follows:
Senior Secured First Lien Term Loans We structure these investments as senior secured loans.  We obtain security interests in the assets of the portfolio companies that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans.  This collateral generally takes the form of first-priority liens on the assets of the portfolio company borrower.  Our senior secured loans may provide for amortization of principal with the majority of the amortization due at maturity.
Senior Secured Second Lien Term Loans We structure these investments as junior, secured loans. We obtain security interests in the assets of these portfolio companies that serves as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. This collateral generally takes the form of second-priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company. These loans typically provide for amortization of principal in the initial years of the loans, with the majority of the amortization due at maturity.
Senior Secured First Lien Notes We structure these investments as senior secured loans. We obtain security interests in the assets of these portfolio companies that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. This collateral generally takes the form of priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company. These loans typically have interest-only payments (often representing a combination of cash pay and payment-in-kind, or ("PIK") interest), with amortization of principal due at maturity. PIK interest represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term and recorded as interest income on an accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected.
Warrants and Minority Equity Securities In some cases, we may also receive nominally priced warrants or options to buy a minority equity interest in the portfolio company in connection with a debt investment.  As a result, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest.  We may structure such warrants to include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as a “put,” or right to sell such securities back to the issuer, upon the occurrence of specified events.  In many cases, we may also seek to obtain registration rights in connection with these equity interests, which may include demand and “piggyback” registration rights.
Unitranche Loans We structure our unitranche loans, which combine the characteristics of traditional senior secured first lien term loans and subordinated notes as senior secured loans.  We obtain security interests in the assets of these portfolio companies that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. This collateral generally takes the form of first-priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company.  Unitranche loans typically provide for amortization of principal in the initial years of the loans, with the majority of the amortization due at maturity.
4


Unsecured Debt We structure these investments as unsecured, subordinated loans that provide for relatively high, fixed interest rates that provide us with significant current interest income. These loans typically have interest-only payments (often representing a combination of cash pay and payment-in-kind, or PIK interest), with amortization of principal due at maturity. Subordinated notes generally allow the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term, and there is a risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity. Subordinated notes are generally more volatile than secured loans and may involve a greater risk of loss of principal. Subordinated notes often include a PIK feature, which effectively operates as negative amortization of loan principal.
We tailor the terms of each investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and the prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that protects our rights and manages our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan and improve its operating results.  We seek to limit the downside potential of our investments by:

• | selecting investments that we believe have a low probability of loss of principal;


• | requiring a total return on our investments (including both interest and potential equity appreciation) that we believe will compensate us appropriately for credit risk; and


• | negotiating covenants in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies as much flexibility in managing their businesses as possible, consistent with the preservation of our capital. Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights, including either observation or rights to a seat on the board of directors under some circumstances.

We expect to hold most of our investments to maturity or repayment, but we may realize or sell some of our investments earlier if a liquidity event occurs, such as a sale or recapitalization transaction, or the worsening of the credit quality of the portfolio company.
Managerial Assistance
As a BDC, we offer, and must provide upon request, managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. MCC Advisors provides such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. We may receive fees for these services and will reimburse MCC Advisors, as our administrator, for its allocated costs in providing such assistance, subject to the review and approval by our board of directors, including our independent directors.
Leverage
Through any credit facility that we may enter into in the future, we may borrow funds to make additional investments, a practice known as ‘‘leverage,’’ to attempt to increase return to our stockholders. The amount of leverage that we employ at any particular time will depend on our Adviser's and our board of directors’ assessments of market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. We are also subject to certain regulatory requirements relating to our borrowings. For a discussion of such requirements, see ‘‘Regulation - Senior Securities’’ and ‘‘Regulation - Small Business Investment Company Regulations.’’
We may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our common stock through cash purchases, as well as retire, cancel or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.
Competition
Our primary competitors to provide financing to private middle-market companies are public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial finance companies, other BDCs, SBICs and private equity and hedge funds. Some competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or to the distribution and other requirements we must satisfy to maintain our favorable RIC tax status.
Employees
We do not have any employees. Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by our Adviser. Our Adviser employs over 30 investment professionals, including its principals. In addition, we reimburse our administrator for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under an administration agreement, including the compensation of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer, and their respective staff. 
Administration
We have entered into an administration agreement, pursuant to which MCC Advisors furnishes us with office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping and other administrative services at such facilities. Under our administration agreement, MCC Advisors performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which include, among other things, being responsible for the financial records which we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC.
Agreements and Plan of Mergers
5

On August 9, 2018 the Company entered into a definitive agreement to merge with Sierra Income Corporation (“Sierra”). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “MCC Merger Agreement”) by and between Sierra and the Company, the Company would, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the MCC Merger Agreement, merge with and into Sierra, with Sierra as the surviving entity in the merger (the "MCC Merger"). Under the MCC Merger, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the MCC Merger effective time (other than shares of our common stock held by the Company, Sierra or their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) would be converted into the right to receive 0.8050 shares of Sierra’s common stock.
Simultaneously, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “MDLY Merger Agreement”) by and among Sierra, MDLY and Sierra Management, Inc., a newly formed Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Sierra (“Merger Sub”), MDLY would, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the MDLY Merger Agreement, merge with and into the Merger Sub, and MDLY’s existing asset management business would continue to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Sierra in the merger (the “MDLY Merger” together with the MCC Merger, the “Mergers”). In the MDLY Merger, each share of MDLY Class A common stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the MDLY Merger effective time (other than Dissenting Shares (as defined in the MDLY Merger Agreement) and shares of MDLY Class A common stock held by MDLY, Sierra or their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) would be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.3836 shares of Sierra’s common stock; plus (ii) cash in an amount equal to $3.44 per share. In addition, MDLY’s stockholders would have the right to receive certain dividends and/or other payments.
On July 29, 2019, the Company entered into the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 29, 2019 (the “Amended MCC Merger Agreement”), by and between the Company and Sierra, pursuant to which the Company will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Amended MCC Merger Agreement, merge with and into Sierra, with Sierra as the surviving company in the MCC Merger. In the MCC Merger, each share of the Company’s common stock (other than shares of the Company’s common stock held by the Company, Sierra or their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) will be exchanged for the right to receive (i) 0.68 shares of Sierra’s common stock if the attorneys’ fees of plaintiffs’ counsel and litigation expenses paid or incurred by plaintiffs’ counsel or advanced by plaintiffs in connection with the FrontFour Action, as described in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” (such fees and expenses, the “Plaintiff Attorney Fees”), are less than or equal to $10,000,000; (ii) 0.66 shares of Sierra’s common stock if the Plaintiff Attorney Fees are equal to or greater than $15,000,000; (iii) between 0.68 and 0.66 per share of Sierra’s common stock if the Plaintiff Attorney Fees are greater than $10,000,000 but less than $15,000,000, calculated on a descending basis, based on straight line interpolation between $10,000,000 and $15,000,000; or (iv) 0.66 shares of Sierra’s common stock in the event that the Plaintiff Attorney Fees are not determined prior to the closing of the MCC Merger (such ratio, the “MCC Merger Exchange Ratio”).
In addition, on July 29, 2019, Sierra and MDLY announced the execution of the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 29, 2019 (the “Amended MDLY Merger Agreement”), by and among MDLY, Sierra, and Merger Sub, pursuant to which MDLY will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement, merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub as the surviving company in the MDLY Merger. In the MDLY Merger, each share of MDLY Class A common stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the MDLY Merger effective time, other than shares of MDLY Class A common stock held by MDLY, Sierra or their respective wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Excluded MDLY Shares”) and the Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement), held, immediately prior to the MDLY Merger effective time, by any person other than a Medley LLC unitholder, will be exchanged for (i) 0.2668 shares of Sierra’s common stock; plus (ii) cash in an amount equal to $2.96 per share. In addition, in the MDLY Merger, each share of MDLY Class A common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the MDLY Merger effective time, other than the Excluded MDLY Shares and the Dissenting Shares, held, immediately prior to the MDLY Merger effective time, by Medley LLC unitholders will be exchanged for (i) 0.2072 shares of Sierra’s common stock; plus (ii) cash in an amount equal to $2.66 per share.
Pursuant to terms of the Amended MCC Merger Agreement, the consummation of the MCC Merger is conditioned upon the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions to closing under the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement and the consummation of the MDLY Merger. However, pursuant to the terms of the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement, the consummation of the MDLY Merger is not contingent upon the consummation of the MCC Merger. If both Mergers are successfully consummated, Sierra’s common stock would be listed on the NYSE, with such listing expected to be effective as of the closing date of the Mergers, and Sierra’s common stock will be listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (“TASE”), with such listing expected to be effective as of the closing date of the MCC Merger. If, however, only the MDLY Merger is consummated, Sierra’s common stock would be listed on the NYSE. If both Mergers are successfully consummated, the investment portfolios of MCC and Sierra would be combined, Merger Sub, as a successor to MDLY, would be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Combined Company, and the Combined Company would be internally managed by MCC Advisors LLC, its wholly controlled adviser subsidiary. If only the MDLY Merger is consummated, the investment portfolios of MCC and Sierra would not be combined; however, the investment management function relating to the operation of Sierra, as the surviving company, would still be internalized (the “Sierra/MDLY Company”) and the Sierra/MDLY Company would be managed by MCC Advisors. The Mergers are subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company, Sierra, and MDLY, regulators, including the SEC, court approval of the Stipulation (as described below), other customary closing conditions and third-party consents. There is no assurance that any of the foregoing conditions will be satisfied.
On February 11, 2019, a purported stockholder class action was commenced in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by FrontFour Capital Group LLC and FrontFour Master Fund, Ltd. (together, “FrontFour”), captioned as FrontFour Capital Group LLC, et al. v. Brook Taube et al., Case No. 2019-0100 (the “FrontFour Action”) against defendants Brook Taube, Seth Taube, Jeff Tonkel, Mark Lerdal, Karin Hirtler-Garvey, John E. Mack, Arthur S. Ainsberg, MDLY, Sierra, the Company, MCC Advisors, Medley Group LLC, and Medley LLC. The complaint, as amended on February 12, 2019, alleged that the individuals named as defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Company’s stockholders in connection with the MCC Merger, and that MDLY, Sierra, MCC Advisors, Medley Group LLC, and Medley LLC aided and abetted those alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. The complaint sought to enjoin the vote of MCC stockholders on the proposed merger and enjoin enforcement of certain provisions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 9, 2018, by and between MCC and Sierra (the “MCC Merger Agreement”). The Court held a trial on the plaintiffs’ claims on March 6-7, 2019 and issued a Memorandum Opinion (the “Decision”) on March 11, 2019. The Court denied the plaintiffs’ requests to (i) permanently enjoin the proposed merger and (ii) require the Company to conduct a “shopping process” for the Company on terms proposed by the plaintiffs in their complaint. The Court held that the Company’s directors breached their fiduciary duties in entering into the proposed merger, but rejected the plaintiffs’ claim that Sierra aided and abetted those breaches of fiduciary duties. The Court ordered the defendants to issue corrective disclosures consistent with the Decision, and enjoined a vote of the Company’s stockholders on the proposed merger until such disclosures have been made and stockholders have had the opportunity to assimilate this information. On March 20, 2019, another purported stockholder class action was commenced by Stephen Altman 
6

against Brook Taube, Seth Taube, Jeff Tonkel, Arthur S. Ainsberg, Karin Hirtler-Garvey, Mark Lerdal, and John E. Mack in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned Altman v. Taube, Case No. 2019-0219 (the “Altman Action”). The complaint alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to stockholders of the Company in connection with the vote of the Company’s stockholders on the proposed mergers. On April 8, 2019, the Court granted a stipulation consolidating the FrontFour Action and the Altman Action, designating the amended complaint in the FrontFour Action as the operative complaint, and designating the plaintiffs in the FrontFour Action and their counsel the lead plaintiffs and lead plaintiffs’ counsel, respectively.
On April 15, 2019, certain parties reached agreement on the principal terms of a settlement of the FrontFour Action, which were contained in a term sheet, dated April 15, 2019 (the “Settlement Term Sheet”). On July 29, 2019, MCC entered into a Stipulation of Settlement (and, as amended on August 8, 2019, the “Stipulation”) by and among the Company, Brook Taube, Seth Taube, Jeff Tonkel, Mark Lerdal, Karin Hirtler-Garvey, John E. Mack, Arthur S. Ainsberg, MDLY, MCC Advisors, Medley LLC and Medley Group LLC (the “Medley Parties”), on the one hand, and FrontFour, on behalf of itself and a class of similarly situated stockholders of the Company, on the other hand, in connection with the FrontFour Action.
The Stipulation provides for the settlement of all claims brought against the Medley Parties in the FrontFour Action. Under the Stipulation, the Company agreed to seek the agreement and/or consent of Sierra to effect certain amendments to (i) the MCC Merger Agreement and (ii) the MDLY Merger Agreement (together with the MCC Merger Agreement, the “Merger Agreements”), which have been reflected in the amended and restated Merger Agreements annexed to the Stipulation. The Stipulation also provides for, if the MCC Merger is consummated, the creation of a settlement fund, consisting of $17 million in cash and $30 million of Sierra stock, with the number of shares of Sierra stock to be calculated using the pro forma net asset value reported in the future proxy supplement describing the amendments to the MCC Merger Agreement, which will be distributed to eligible members of the Settlement Class (as defined in the Stipulation). Under the Stipulation, MDLY also consented to certain amendments to the Merger Agreements that have been reflected in the amended and restated Merger Agreements annexed to the Stipulation. In addition, in connection with the Stipulation, on July 29, 2019, the Company entered into a Governance Agreement with FrontFour Capital Group LLC, FrontFour Master Fund, Ltd., FrontFour Capital Corp., FrontFour Opportunity Fund, David A. Lorber, Stephen E. Loukas and Zachary R. George, pursuant to which, among other matters, FrontFour is subject to customary standstill restrictions and required to vote in favor of the MCC Merger at a meeting of stockholders to approve the Amended MCC Merger Agreement.
The Stipulation also provides for mutual releases between and among FrontFour and the Settlement Class, on the one hand, and the Medley Parties, on the other hand, of all claims that were or could have been asserted in the FrontFour Action. The Medley Parties will also release all claims arising out of or relating to the prosecution and settlement of the FrontFour Action and all claims that were or could have been asserted (other than claims against the Highland Parties, as defined in the Stipulation) in the litigation pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York captioned Medley Capital Corporation v. FrontFour Capital Group LLC, et al., No. 1:19-cv-02055-LTS (S.D.N.Y.) (the “Federal Action”), and FrontFour and the Settlement Class will release all claims arising out of or relating to the prosecution and settlement of the Federal Action.
The Stipulation further provides that the Company and FrontFour shall work together in good faith to agree to supplemental disclosures relating to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreements consistent with the Decision.
The Stipulation is subject to the approval of the Court. On September 26, 2019, FrontFour filed a motion seeking an order approving the Stipulation, and also moved for the Court to award plaintiffs’ counsel attorneys’ fees in the amount of $22 million and expenses in the amount of $420,334.97 (the “Fee Application”). The Court held a hearing to consider the Stipulation and the Fee Application on October 24, 2019. 
On November 19, 2019, the Court issued a bench ruling approving the Stipulation. The Court also awarded attorney’s fees as follows: (i) an award of $3,000,000 to lead plaintiffs’ counsel and $75,000 to counsel to plaintiff Stephen Altman (the “Therapeutics Fee Award”) and (ii) an award in an amount equal to 26% of the nominal value of the settlement fund, grossed up to include the amount of the lead plaintiffs’ counsel’s attorney’s fees, and excluding the portion of the fees borne by the class under the Amended MCC Merger Agreement, as well as an award of $100,000 relating to the composition of the board of directors of the post-Merger company (the “Contingent Fee Award” and, together with the Therapeutics Fee Award, the “Fee Awards”). The parties disagreed as to how to apply the formula that the Court indicated will be used to calculate the Contingent Fee Award. Accordingly, the parties submitted different forms of the proposed form of order and final judgment, as applicable, for review and entry by the Court, together with letter briefs setting forth their respective interpretations of the Court’s November 19, 2019 bench ruling. The Plaintiff contends that the amount of the Contingent Fee Award is fixed at $14,540,888. Defendants contend that the amount will be less than $14,540,888, but the actual amount cannot be determined prior to closing. The Therapeutics Fee Award will be payable within five (5) business days of the entry of an order and judgment by the Court. The Contingent Fee Award is contingent upon the closing of the MCC Merger, and will be due within five (5) business days of the closing of the MCC Merger and establishment of the Settlement Fund. The Fee Awards will be paid by MCC or its successor.

(1) | All interest is payable in cash and/or PIK, and all London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) represents 1 and 3 Month LIBOR unless otherwise indicated. For each debt investment, we have provided the current interest rate as of September 30, 2019.

As of September 30, 2019, our income-bearing investment portfolio, which represented 80.0% of our total portfolio, had a weighted average yield based upon cost of our portfolio investments of approximately 9.5%, and 85.2% of our income-bearing investment portfolio bore interest based on floating rates, such as LIBOR, while 14.8% of our income-bearing investment portfolio bore interest at fixed rates. As of September 30, 2019, the weighted average yield based upon cost of our total portfolio was approximately 5.2%. The weighted average yield of our total portfolio does not represent the total return to our stockholders. The weighted average yield on income producing investments is computed based upon a combination of the cash flows to date and the contractual interest payments, principal amortization and fee notes due at maturity without giving effect to closing fees received, base management fees, incentive fees or general fund related expenses. For each floating rate loan, the projected fixed-rate equivalent coupon rate used to forecast the interest cash flows was calculated by adding the interest rate spread specified in the relevant loan document to the fixed-rate equivalent floating rate, duration-matched to the specific loan, adjusted by the floating rate floor and/or cap in place on that loan.

THE ADVISER
14

MCC Advisors serves as our investment adviser and is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors, MCC Advisors manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory and management services to us pursuant to an investment management agreement by and between the Company and MCC Advisors.
Investment Management Agreement
Under the terms of our investment management agreement, MCC Advisors:

• | determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;


• | identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies); and


• | executes, closes, monitors and administers the investments we make, including the exercise of any voting or consent rights.

MCC Advisors’ services under the investment management agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired.
Pursuant to our investment management agreement, we pay MCC Advisors a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of a base management fee and a two-part incentive fee.
On December 3, 2015, MCC Advisors recommended and, in consultation with the Board, agreed to reduce fees under the investment management agreement. Beginning January 1, 2016, the base management fee was reduced to 1.50% on gross assets above $1 billion. In addition, MCC Advisors reduced its incentive fee from 20% on pre-incentive fee net investment income over an 8% hurdle, to 17.5% on pre-incentive fee net investment income over a 6% hurdle. Moreover, the revised incentive fee includes a netting mechanism and is subject to a rolling three-year look back from January 1, 2016 forward. Under no circumstances will the new fee structure result in higher fees to MCC Advisors than fees under the prior investment management agreement.
The following discussion of our base management fee and two-part incentive fee reflects the terms of the fee waiver agreement executed by MCC Advisors on February 8, 2016 (the “Fee Waiver Agreement”). The terms of the Fee Waiver Agreement are effective as of January 1, 2016, and are a permanent reduction in the base management fee and incentive fee on net investment income payable to MCC Advisors for the investment advisory and management services it provides under the investment management agreement. The Fee Waiver Agreement does not change the second component of the incentive fee, which is the incentive fee on capital gains.
Base Management Fee
For providing investment advisory and management services to us, MCC Advisors receives a base management fee. The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% (0.4375% per quarter) of up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s gross assets and 1.50% (0.375% per quarter) of any amounts over $1.0 billion of the Company’s gross assets, and is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee will be calculated based on the average value of the Company’s gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters and will be appropriately pro-rated for any partial quarter. On May 4, 2018, MCC Advisors voluntarily elected to waive $380,000 of the base management fee payable for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, which is shown on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Incentive Fee
The incentive fee has two components, as follows:
Incentive Fee Based on Income
The first component of the incentive fee is payable quarterly in arrears and is based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income earned during the calendar quarter for which the incentive fee is being calculated. MCC Advisors is entitled to receive the incentive fee on net investment income from us if our Ordinary Income (as defined below) exceeds a quarterly “hurdle rate” of 1.5%. The hurdle amount is calculated after making appropriate adjustments to the Company’s net assets, as determined as of the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter, in order to account for any capital raising or other capital actions as a result of any issuances by the Company of its common stock (including issuances pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan), any repurchase by the Company of its own common stock, and any dividends paid by the Company, each as may have occurred during the relevant quarter.
Beginning with the calendar quarter that commenced on January 1, 2016, the incentive fee on net investment income is determined and paid quarterly in arrears at the end of each calendar quarter by reference to our aggregate net investment income, as adjusted as described below, from the calendar quarter then ending and the eleven preceding calendar quarters (or if shorter, the number of quarters that have occurred since January 1, 2016). We refer to such period as the “Trailing Twelve Quarters.”
The hurdle amount for the incentive fee on net investment income is determined on a quarterly basis, and is equal to 1.5% multiplied by the Company’s net asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The hurdle amount is calculated after making appropriate adjustments to the Company’s net assets, as determined as of the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter, in order to account for any capital raising or other capital actions as a result of any issuances by the Company of its common stock (including issuances pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan), any repurchase by the Company of its own common stock, and any dividends paid by the Company, each as may have occurred during the relevant quarter. The incentive fee for any partial period will be appropriately prorated. Any incentive fee on net investment income will be paid to MCC Advisors on a quarterly basis, and will be based on the amount by which (A) aggregate net investment income (“Ordinary 
15

Income”) in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds (B) the hurdle amount for such Trailing Twelve Quarters. The amount of the excess of (A) over (B) described in this paragraph for such Trailing Twelve Quarters is referred to as the “Excess Income Amount.” For the avoidance of doubt, Ordinary Income is net of all fees and expenses, including the reduced base management fee but excluding any incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income or on the Company’s capital gains.
Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Income
The incentive fee on net investment income for each quarter is determined as follows:

• | No incentive fee on net investment income is payable to MCC Advisors for any calendar quarter for which there is no Excess Income Amount;


• | 100% of the Ordinary Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle amount, but is less than or equal to an amount, which we refer to as the “Catch-up Amount,” determined as the sum of 1.8182% multiplied by the Company’s net assets at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter, as adjusted as noted above, comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters is included in the calculation of the incentive fee on net investment income; and


• | 17.5% of the Ordinary Income that exceeds the Catch-up Amount is included in the calculation of the incentive fee on net investment income.

The amount of the incentive fee on net investment income that will be paid to MCC Advisors for a particular quarter will equal the excess of the incentive fee so calculated minus the aggregate incentive fees on net investment income that were paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters but not in excess of the Incentive Fee Cap (as described below).
The incentive fee on net investment income that is paid to MCC Advisors for a particular quarter is subject to a cap (the “Incentive Fee Cap”). The Incentive Fee Cap for any quarter is an amount equal to (a) 17.5% of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (b) the aggregate incentive fees on net investment income that were paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters.
“Cumulative Net Return” means (x) the Ordinary Income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (y) any Net Capital Loss (as described below), if any, in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, the Company will pay no incentive fee on net investment income to MCC Advisors for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is a positive value but is less than the incentive fee on net investment income that is payable to MCC Advisors for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Company will pay an incentive fee on net investment income to MCC Advisors equal to the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is equal to or greater than the incentive fee on net investment income that is payable to MCC Advisors for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Company will pay an incentive fee on net investment income to MCC Advisors, calculated as described above, for such quarter without regard to the Incentive Fee Cap.
“Net Capital Loss” in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, and dilution to the Company’s net assets due to capital raising or capital actions, in such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized and accretion to the Company’s net assets due to capital raising or capital action, in such period.
Dilution to the Company’s net assets due to capital raising is calculated, in the case of issuances of common stock, as the amount by which the net asset value per share was adjusted over the transaction price per share, multiplied by the number of shares issued. Accretion to the Company’s net assets due to capital raising is calculated, in the case of issuances of common stock (including issuances pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan), as the excess of the transaction price per share over the amount by which the net asset value per share was adjusted, multiplied by the number of shares issued. Accretion to the Company’s net assets due to other capital action is calculated, in the case of repurchases by the Company of its own common stock, as the excess of the amount by which the net asset value per share was adjusted over the transaction price per share multiplied by the number of shares repurchased by the Company.
For the avoidance of doubt, the purpose of the new incentive fee calculation under the Fee Waiver Agreement is to permanently reduce aggregate fees payable to MCC Advisors by the Company, effective as of January 1, 2016. In order to ensure that the Company will pay MCC Advisors lesser aggregate fees on a cumulative basis, as calculated beginning January 1, 2016, we will, at the end of each quarter, also calculate the base management fee and incentive fee on net investment income owed by the Company to MCC Advisors based on the formula in place prior to January 1, 2016. If, at any time beginning January 1, 2016, the aggregate fees on a cumulative basis, as calculated based on the formula in place after January 1, 2016, would be greater than the aggregate fees on a cumulative basis, as calculated based on the formula in place prior to January 1, 2016, MCC Advisors shall only be entitled to the lesser of those two amounts.
The second component of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the investment management agreement as of the termination date) and equals 20.0% of our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less cumulative realized capital losses, unrealized capital depreciation (unrealized depreciation on a gross investment-by-investment basis at the end of each calendar year) and all capital gains upon which prior performance-based capital gains incentive fee payments were previously made to the investment adviser.
Under GAAP, the Company calculates the second component of the incentive fee as if the Company had realized all assets at their fair values as of the reporting date. Accordingly, when applicable, the Company accrues a provisional capital gains incentive fee taking into account any unrealized gains or losses. As the provisional capital gains incentive fee is subject to the performance of investments until there is a realization event, the amount of the provisional capital gains incentive fee accrued at a reporting date may vary from the capital gains incentive that is ultimately realized and the differences could be material.
For the year ended September 30, 2019, the Company incurred net base management fees payable to MCC Advisors of $11.2 million and did not incur any incentive fees related to pre-incentive fee net investment income.

The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee effective as of January 1, 2016 pursuant to the Fee Waiver Agreement:

Pre-incentive Fee Net Investment Income
(Expressed as a Percentage of the Value of Net Assets)
Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation
Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee:


• | Quarter 1


• | Net Asset Value at the start of Quarter 1 = $100.0 million (1 million shares)


• | Quarter 1 Ordinary Income = $5.0 million


• | Quarter 1 Issue 1 million shares at $101 per share = $1.0 million


• | Quarter 1 Capital Gain = $1.0 million


• | Quarter 1 Hurdle Amount = $1.5 million (calculated based on a quarterly 1.5% hurdle rate)


• | Quarter 1 Catchup Amount = $1.81818 million (calculated based on a quarterly 1.81818% rate)


• | Quarter 2


• | Net Asset Value at the start of Quarter 2 = $100.0 million (1 million shares)


• | Quarter 2 Ordinary Income = $1.5 million


• | Quarter 2 Capital Gain = $1.0 million


• | Quarter 2 Hurdle Amount = $1.5 million (calculated based on a quarterly 1.5% hurdle rate)


• | Quarter 2 Catchup Amount = $1.81818 million (calculated based on a quarterly 1.81818% rate)


• | Quarter 3


• | Net Asset Value at the start of Quarter 3 = $100.0 million (1 million shares)


• | Quarter 3 Ordinary Income = $4.0 million


• | Quarter 3 Repurchase 500,000 shares at $99 per share = $0.50 million


• | Quarter 3 Capital Loss = ($8.0) million


• | Quarter 3 Hurdle Amount = $1.5 million (calculated based on a quarterly 1.5% hurdle rate)


• | Quarter 3 Catchup Amount = $1.81818 million (calculated based on a quarterly 1.81818% rate)


• | Quarter 4


• | Net Asset Value at the start of Quarter 4 = $100.0 million (1 million shares)


• | Quarter 4 Ordinary Income = $4.0 million


• | Quarter 4 Capital Gain = $3.0 million


• | Quarter 4 Hurdle Amount = $1.5 million (calculated based on a quarterly 1.5% hurdle rate)


• | Quarter 4 Catchup Amount = $1.81818 million (calculated based on a quarterly 1.81818% rate)

Determination of Incentive Fee Based on Income:

In Quarter 1, the Ordinary Income of $5.0 million exceeds the Hurdle Amount of $1.50 million and the Catchup Amount of $1.8182 million. There is $2 million of Net Capital Gains, including a capital gain of $1 million and accretion to the Company’s net asset value of $1 million as a result of issuing shares at a transaction price that exceeds the net asset value per share. As a result, an Incentive Fee based on income of $875,000 ((100% of $318,182) + (17.5% of $3,181,818)) is payable to our investment adviser for Quarter 1.

In Quarter 2, the Quarter 2 Ordinary Income of $1.50 million does not exceed the Quarter 2 Hurdle Amount of $1.50 million, but the aggregate Ordinary Income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $6.50 million exceeds the aggregate Hurdle Amount for the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $3.0 million and the aggregate Catchup Amount for the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $3.6364 million. There are no Net Capital Losses. As a result, an Incentive Fee based on income of $262,500 ($1,137,500 (100% of $636,364) + (17.5% of 2,863,636) minus $875,000 paid in Quarter 1) would be payable to our investment adviser for Quarter 2.

In Quarter 3, the aggregate Ordinary Income of the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $10.5 million exceeds the aggregate Hurdle Amount for the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $4.5 million and the aggregate Catchup Amount for the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $5.4545 million. However, there is an aggregate

Net Capital Loss of ($4.5) million for the Trailing Twelve Quarters. As a result, the Incentive Fee Cap would apply. The Incentive Fee Cap equals $(87,500), calculated as follows:

(17.5% x ($10.5 million minus $4.5 million)) minus $1,137,500 paid in Quarters 1 and 2. Because the Incentive Fee Cap is a negative value, there is no Incentive Fee based on income payable to the adviser for Quarter 3.

In Quarter 4, the aggregate Ordinary Income of the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $14.50 million exceeds the aggregate Hurdle Amount for the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $6.0 million and the aggregate Catchup Amount for the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $7.2727 million. The calculation of the Incentive Fee based on income would be $1.40 million ($2,537,500 (100% of $1,272,727) + (17.5% of $7,227,272) minus $1,137,500 million paid in Quarters 1 and 2). However, there is an aggregate Net Capital Loss of $(1.50) million for the Trailing Twelve Quarters. As a result, the Incentive Fee Cap would apply. The Incentive Fee Cap equals $1,137,500 calculated as follows:

(17.5% X ($14.5 million minus $1.5 million)) minus $1,137,500. Because the Incentive Fee Cap is positive but less than the Incentive Fee based on Income of $1.40 million calculated prior to the Incentive Fee Cap, an Incentive Fee based on Income of $1,137,500 is payable to our investment adviser for Quarter 4.

Example 2: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee:

Alternative 1:
Assumptions
Year 1:  $20 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), and $30 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”)
Year 2:  Investment A sold for $50 million and fair market value, or FMV, of Investment B determined to be $32 million
Year 3:  FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million
Year 4:  Investment B sold for $31 million
The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be:
Year 1:  None
Year 2:  Capital gains incentive fee of $6.0 million ($30 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20.0%)
Year 3:  None; $5.0 million (20.0% multiplied by ($30 million cumulative capital gains less $5 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $6.0 million (previous capital gains fee paid in Year 2) (the $1.0 million difference would not be deducted from future capital gains incentive fees)
Year 4:  Capital gains incentive fee of $200,000; $6.2 million ($31 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20.0%) less $6.0 million (capital gains fee paid in Year 2)
Alternative 2:
Assumptions

Year 1:  $20 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), $30 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”) and $25 million investment made in Company C (“Investment C”)
Year 2:  Investment A sold for $50 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be $25 million
Year 3:  FMV of Investment B determined to be $27 million and Investment C sold for $30 million
Year 4:  FMV of Investment B determined to be $35 million
Year 5:  Investment B sold for $20 million
The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be:
Year 1:  None
Year 2:  Capital gains incentive fee of $5.0 million; 20.0% multiplied by $25 million ($30 million realized capital gains on Investment A less $5 million unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B)
Year 3:  Capital gains incentive fee of $1.4 million; $6.4 million (20.0% multiplied by $32 million ($35 million cumulative realized capital gains less $3 million unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B)) less $5.0 million capital gains fee received in Year 2
Year 4:  None
Year 5:  None; $5.0 million of capital gains incentive fee (20.0% multiplied by $25 million (cumulative realized capital gains of $35 million less realized capital losses of $10 million)) less $6.4 million cumulative capital gains fee paid in Year 2 and Year 3 (the $1.4 million difference would not be deducted from future capital gains incentive fees)

As noted above, in order to ensure that the Company will pay MCC Advisors a lesser base management fee and incentive fee on net investment income on a cumulative basis, as calculated beginning January 1, 2016, the Company will, at the end of each quarter, also calculate the base management fee and incentive fee on net investment income owed by the Company to MCC Advisors based on the formula in place prior to the Fee Waiver Agreement, and pay lesser of those two amounts. Set forth below is a description of the base management fee and the incentive fee on net investment income payable to MCC Advisors prior to the Fee Waiver Agreement.

Base Management Fee — Prior to Fee Waiver Agreement

The base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of our gross assets, and is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters.
Incentive Fee — Prior to Fee Waiver Agreement

The incentive fee based on net investment income was calculated as 20.0% of the amount, if any, by which our pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets calculated as of the end of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the calendar quarter for which the incentive fee is being calculated, exceeds a 2.0% (which is 8.0% annualized) hurdle rate but also includes a “‘catch-up’ provision. Under 
18

this provision, in any calendar quarter, our investment adviser receives no incentive fee until our net investment income equals the hurdle rate of 2.0%, but then receives, as a “catch-up”, 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.5%. The effect of this provision is that, if pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter, our investment adviser will receive 20% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if the hurdle rate did not apply. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter including the base management fee, expenses payable under the administration agreement, and any interest expense and any dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee. Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash.

Payment of Our Expenses

All investment professionals and staff of MCC Advisors, when, and to the extent, engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to such services, is provided and paid for by MCC Advisors. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including those relating to:

• | our organization and continued corporate existence;


• | calculating our net asset value (“NAV”) (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms);


• | expenses, including travel expense, incurred by MCC Advisors or payable to third parties performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies, monitoring our investments and, if necessary, enforcing our rights;


• | interest payable on debt incurred to finance our investments;


• | the costs of all offerings of common shares and other securities; 


• | the base management fee and any incentive management fee;


• | distributions on our shares;

• | all other expenses reasonably incurred by us or MCC Advisors in connection with administering our business, such as the allocable portion of overhead under our administration agreement, including rent and other allocable portions of the cost of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs (including travel expenses).

We reimburse MCC Advisors for costs and expenses incurred for office space rental, office equipment and utilities allocable to the performance by MCC Advisors of its duties under the administration agreement, as well as any costs and expenses incurred relating to any non-investment advisory, administrative or operating services provided to us or in the form of managerial assistance to portfolio companies that request it.

From time to time, MCC Advisors pays amounts owed by us to third party providers of goods or services.  We subsequently reimburse MCC Advisors for such amounts paid on our behalf.

Limitation of Liability and Indemnification
The investment management agreement provides that MCC Advisors and its officers, directors, employees and affiliates are not liable to us or any of our stockholders for any act or omission by it or its employees in the supervision or management of our investment activities or for any loss sustained by us or our stockholders, except that the foregoing exculpation does not extend to any act or omission constituting willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its obligations under the investment management agreement. The investment management agreement also provides for indemnification by us of MCC Advisors’ members, directors, officers, employees, agents and control persons for liabilities incurred by it in connection with their services to us, subject to the same limitations and to certain conditions.
Duration and Termination
The investment management agreement was initially approved by our board of directors on November 3, 2010 and was executed on January 11, 2011. Pursuant to its terms and under the 1940 Act, the investment management agreement had an initial two-year term, and then was subject to an annual approval by our board of directors. Unless terminated earlier as described below, it will continue in effect from year to year if approved annually by our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons. The investment management agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The investment management agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon not more than 60 days’ written notice to the other. See “Risks — Risks Related to Our Business — We are dependent upon senior management personnel of MCC Advisors for our future success, and if MCC Advisors is unable to retain qualified personnel or if MCC Advisors loses any member of its senior management team, our ability to achieve our investment objective could be significantly harmed.”
Annual Board Approval of the Investment Management Agreement
On November 29, 2018, our board of directors, at an in-person meeting, approved the renewal of the investment management agreement for an additional one-year term. Based on the information reviewed and the discussions held, our board of directors, including a majority of the independent directors, concluded that the investment management fees and terms are reasonable in relation to the services to be provided and approved the investment management agreement for a period of one additional year, which will expire on January 19, 2020. In making its determination, our board of directors took into account, among other things, its consideration and approval of the MCC Merger, consummation of which is subject to a number of conditions and approvals.
Administration Agreement
On January 19, 2011, the Company entered into an administration agreement with MCC Advisors. Pursuant to this agreement, MCC Advisors furnishes us with office facilities and equipment, clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping and other administrative services related to the operations of the Company. We reimburse MCC Advisors for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staff. From time to time, our administrator may pay amounts owed by us to third-party service providers and we will subsequently reimburse our administrator for such amounts paid on our behalf. For the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we incurred $3.3 million, $3.6 million, and $3.8 million in administrator expenses, respectively.
Our board of directors approved the continuation of our administration agreement on November 29, 2018, which extended the term of the agreement for an additional period of one year beginning on January 19, 2019. Based on the information relating to the terms of the Administration Agreement and the discussions held, our board of directors, including a majority of the non-interested directors, approved the Administration Agreement as being in the best interests of our stockholders. The administration agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days' written notice to the other party. 
License Agreement
We have entered into a license agreement with Medley Capital LLC under which Medley Capital LLC has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name “Medley”. Under this agreement, we will have a right to use the “Medley” name for so long as MCC Advisors or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the “Medley” name. This license agreement will remain in effect for so long as the investment management agreement with MCC Advisors is in effect.
REGULATION
General
We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than “interested persons”, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by “a majority of our outstanding voting securities.”
As a BDC, we are required to meet an asset coverage ratio, reflecting the value of our total assets to our total senior securities, which include all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 200%. However, in March 2018, the Small Business Credit Availability Act (the “SBCA”) modified the 1940 Act by allowing a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur from 200% to 150%, if certain requirements are met. Under the 1940 Act, we are allowed to increase our leverage capacity if stockholders representing at least a majority of the votes cast, when a quorum is present, approve a proposal to do so. If we receive stockholder approval, we would be allowed to increase our leverage capacity 
20

on the first day after such approval. Alternatively, the 1940 Act allows the majority of our independent directors to approve an increase in our leverage capacity, and such approval would become effective on the one-year anniversary of such approval. In either case, we would be required to make certain disclosures on our website and in SEC filings regarding, among other things, the receipt of approval to increase our leverage, our leverage capacity and usage, and risks related to leverage. The Company has not sought stockholder or independent director approval to reduce its coverage ratio to 150%.
The SBCA also instructs the SEC to issue rules or amendments to rules allowing BDCs to use the same securities offering and proxy rules that are available to operating companies, including, among other things, allowing BDCs to incorporate by reference in registration statements filed with the SEC and allow certain BDCs to file shelf registration statements that are automatically effective and take advantage of other benefits available to “well-known seasoned issuers” as defined in rules promulgated under the Securities Act. On March 20, 2019, the SEC proposed rule amendments to implement certain provisions of the SBCA; however, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company does not know if and when the proposed rules relating to this legislation will be implemented.
We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC.
Qualifying Assets
Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following:

(1) | Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:


▪ | is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;


▪ | is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the Company) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and


▪ | satisfies either of the following:


* | has a market capitalization of less than $250 million or does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; or


* | is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC, the BDC actually exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible portfolio company, and, as a result thereof, the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company.


(2) | Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.


(3) | Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.


(4) | Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control.


(5) | Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.


(6) | Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.

The regulations defining and interpreting qualifying assets may change over time. We may adjust our investment focus needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area.
Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
A BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in “Regulation — Qualifying Assets” above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% requirement, the BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance. Where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, the BDC will satisfy this test if one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
21

Temporary Investments
Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets”, as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in highly rated commercial paper, U.S. Government agency notes, U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements relating to such securities that are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. Government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, certain diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes will typically require us to limit the amount we invest with any one counterparty.  Our investment adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
Senior Securities
We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% (or 150% if certain requirements are met) immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any preferred stock or publicly traded debt securities are outstanding, we may be prohibited from making distributions to our stockholders or the repurchasing of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—If we use borrowed funds to make investments or fund our business operations, we will be exposed to risks typically associated with leverage which will increase the risk of investing in us.”
Code of Ethics
We and MCC Advisors have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. The code of ethics is available at our website, www.medleycapitalcorp.com, and is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov. 
Privacy Policy
We are committed to maintaining the privacy of stockholders and to safeguarding our non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties.
Generally, we do not receive any nonpublic personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain nonpublic personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third party administrator).
We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about our stockholders to our investment adviser’s employees with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the nonpublic personal information of our stockholders. 
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to MCC Advisors. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of MCC Advisors are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by MCC Advisors and our independent directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change.
MCC Advisors is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, MCC Advisors will have fiduciary duties to us. As part of this duty, MCC Advisors recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. MCC Advisors’ Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures have been formulated to ensure decision-making consistent with these fiduciary duties.
These policies and procedures for voting proxies for our investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.
Proxy Policies
MCC Advisors evaluates routine proxy matters, such as proxy proposals, amendments or resolutions on a case-by-case basis. Routine matters are typically proposed by management and MCC Advisors will normally support such matters so long as they do not measurably change the structure, management control, or operation of the corporation and are consistent with industry standards as well as the corporate laws of the state of incorporation.
MCC Advisors also evaluates non-routine matters on a case-by-case basis. Non-routine proposals concerning social issues are typically proposed by stockholders who believe that the corporation’s internally adopted policies are ill-advised or misguided. If MCC Advisors has determined that management is generally socially responsible, MCC Advisors will generally vote against these types of non-routine proposals. Non-routine proposals concerning financial or corporate issues are usually offered by management and seek to change a corporation’s legal, business or financial structure. MCC Advisors will generally vote in favor of such proposals provided the position of current stockholders is preserved or enhanced. Non-routine proposals concerning stockholder rights are made regularly by both management and stockholders. They can be generalized as involving issues that transfer or realign board or stockholder voting power. MCC Advisors typically would oppose any proposal aimed solely at thwarting potential takeovers by requiring, for example, 
22

super-majority approval. At the same time, MCC Advisors believes stability and continuity promote profitability. MCC Advisors’ guidelines in this area seek a balanced view and individual proposals will be carefully assessed in the context of their particular circumstances.
If a vote may involve a material conflict of interest, prior to approving such vote, MCC Advisors must consult with its Chief Compliance Officer to determine whether the potential conflict is material and if so, the appropriate method to resolve such conflict. If the conflict is determined not to be material, MCC Advisors’ employees shall vote the proxy in accordance with MCC Advisors’ proxy voting policy.
Proxy Voting Records
You may obtain information about how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to:
Chief Compliance Officer
Medley Capital Corporation
280 Park Avenue, 6th Floor East
New York, NY 10017
Other
Under the 1940 Act, we are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below NAV per share. We may, however, issue and sell our common stock, at a price below the current NAV of the common stock, or issue and sell warrants, options or rights to acquire such common stock, at a price below the current NAV of the common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in our best interest and in the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders have approved our policy and practice of making such sales within the preceding 12 months. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our board of directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities. However, we currently do not have the requisite stockholder approval, nor do we have any current plans to seek stockholder approval, to sell or issue shares of our common stock at a price below NAV per share.
In addition, at our 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders we received approval from our stockholders to authorize us, with the approval of our board of directors, to issue securities to, subscribe to, convert to, or purchase shares of the Company’s common stock in one or more offerings, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the proxy statement. Such authorization has no expiration.
We expect to be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.
We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
We and MCC Advisors adopted written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws, and will review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. We and MCC Advisors have designated a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures.
Election to Be Taxed as a RIC
As a BDC, we have elected and qualified to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses (the “Distribution Requirement”).
Taxation as a RIC
As a RIC, if we satisfy the Distribution Requirement, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain, defined as net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses, we distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on any net income or net capital gain not distributed to our stockholders.
Medley Capital will be subject to a nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax of 4% on undistributed income if it does not distribute at least the sum of 98% of its ordinary income in any calendar year, 98.2% of its capital gain net income for each one-year period ending on October 31, and any income and gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which the Company did not pay U.S. federal income tax. Depending on the level of investment company taxable income (“ICTI”) earned in a tax year and the amount of net capital gains recognized in such tax year, the Company may choose to carry forward ICTI in excess of current year dividend distributions into the next tax year. In order to eliminate our liability for income tax, and to the extent necessary to maintain our qualification as a RIC, any such carryover ICTI and net capital gains must be distributed before the end of that next tax year through a dividend declared prior to the 15th day of the 9th month after the close of the taxable year in which such ICTI was generated. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions for excise tax purposes, the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned.
In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:

• | qualify to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;

23


• | derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities, and net income derived from interests in “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive 90% of their income from interest, dividends and other permitted RIC income) (the “90% Income Test”); and


• | diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:


• | at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and


• | no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships (the “Diversification Tests”).

We may invest in partnerships, including qualified publicly traded partnerships, which may result in our being subject to state, local or foreign income and franchise or withholding liabilities.
Any underwriting fees paid by us are not deductible. We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, with increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount.
Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. See “Business — Regulation — Senior Securities.” Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our qualification as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Distribution Requirement or the excise tax requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.
Some of the income and fees that we may recognize will not satisfy the 90% Income Test. In order to ensure that such income and fees do not disqualify us as a RIC for a failure to satisfy the 90% Income Test, we may be required to recognize such income and fees indirectly through one or more entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such corporations will be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax on their earnings, which ultimately will reduce our return on such income and fees.
Failure to Qualify as a RIC
If we were unable to continue to qualify for treatment as a RIC, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions, including distributions of net long-term capital gain, would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year we may be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets (i.e., the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had been liquidated) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five years.
Company Investments
Certain of our investment practices are subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (1) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, including the dividends received deduction, (2) convert lower taxed long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income into higher taxed short-term capital gains or ordinary income, (3) convert ordinary loss or a deduction into capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (4) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (5) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (6) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (7) produce income that will not qualify as good income for purposes of the 90% annual gross income requirement described above. We will monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections and may be required to borrow money or dispose of securities to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification as a RIC.
Investments we make in securities issued at a discount or providing for deferred interest or payment of interest in kind are subject to special tax rules that will affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to stockholders. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, with increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we will generally be required to accrue daily as income a portion of the discount and to distribute such income each year to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes. Since in certain circumstances we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty making distributions in the amounts necessary to satisfy the requirements for maintaining RIC tax treatment and for avoiding U.S. federal

income and excise taxes. Accordingly, we may have to sell some of our investments at times we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment originations to meet these distribution requirements. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC and thereby be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax.
Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long term or short term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant.
In the event we invest in foreign securities, we may be subject to withholding and other foreign taxes with respect to those securities. In that case, our yield on those securities would be decreased. We do not expect to satisfy the requirements necessary to pass through to our stockholders their share of the foreign taxes paid by us.
If we purchase shares in a ‘‘passive foreign investment company’’ (a ‘‘PFIC’’), we may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a portion of any ‘‘excess distribution’’ or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such income is distributed as a taxable dividend by us to our stockholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on us in respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains. If we invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a ‘‘qualified electing fund’’ under the Code (a ‘‘QEF’’), in lieu of the foregoing requirements, we will be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the QEF, even if such income is not distributed to us. Alternatively, we can elect to mark-to-market at the end of each taxable year our shares in a PFIC; in this case, we will recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it does not exceed prior increases included in income. Under either election, we may be required to recognize in a year income in excess of our distributions from PFICs and our proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that year, and such income will nevertheless be subject to the Annual Distribution Requirement and will be taken into account for purposes of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax. 
Income inclusions from a QEF will be ‘‘good income’’ for purposes of the 90% Income Test provided that they are derived in connection with our business of investing in stocks and securities or the QEF distributes such income to us in the same taxable year in which the income is included in our income.
