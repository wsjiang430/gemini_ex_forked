Seasonality and Show Rotation
 GES’ exhibition and event activity can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the frequency and timing of shows: some shows are not held annually, and some shift between quarters. During 2018, GES reported its highest revenue during the second and fourth quarters. During 2017, GES reported its highest revenue during the first and second quarters. The following show rotation revenue metric refers to the net change in revenue from 2017 to 2018 due to show movement between quarters and years. Show rotation refers to shows that occur less frequently than annually, as well as annual shows that shift quarters from one year to the next.
Competition
 In the Live Events industry, GES generally competes across all classes of services and all markets on the basis of discernible differences, value, quality, price, convenience, and service. GES has a competitive advantage through its worldwide network of resources, history of serving as an extension of clients’ teams, experienced and knowledgeable personnel, client-focus, creativity, reliable execution, proprietary technology platforms, and financial strength. All known U.S. competitors and most international competitors are privately held companies that provide limited public information regarding their operations. GES’ primary competitor within its Core Services is a privately-held, U.S.-headquartered company; however, there is substantial competition from a large number of service providers in GES’ other service offerings. 
Growth Strategy
 GES is committed to become the preferred global, full-service provider for Live Events. GES has combined the art of high-impact creativity, service, and expertise with the science of easy-to-use technology, strategy, and worldwide logistics to help clients gain a greater return from their events and enhance the exhibitor and attendee experience. GES holds leading market positions in Exhibitions and Conferences and is pursuing a focused and disciplined growth strategy with the goal of expanding its market share in the currently under-penetrated Corporate Events market. We expect to accomplish this by acquiring businesses and capitalizing on organic opportunities that further the following goals:

• | Global Reach. Leverage global capabilities and large customer base to drive continued growth in new services and other Live Events.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Full-Service Provider. Growth of adjacent services to create a unique and integrated offering to deepen client relationships, expand client base, and increase share of total event spend.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Live Events. Penetration into other Live Events to leverage our existing capabilities and gain more corporate clients.

Seasonality
 Pursuit experiences peak activity during the summer months. During 2018, 87% of Pursuit’s revenue was earned in the second and third quarters. 

Competition
 Pursuit generally competes on the basis of location, uniqueness of facilities, service, quality, and price. Competition exists both locally and regionally across all four lines of business. The hospitality business has a large number of competitors and competes for leisure travelers (both individual and tour groups) across the United States and Canada. Pursuit’s competitive advantage is its distinctive attractions, iconic destinations, and strong culture of hospitality and guest services.
Growth Strategy 
 Pursuit remains focused on delivering inspiring and unforgettable guest experiences in iconic locations while growing and enhancing its unique portfolio of integrated tourism assets through its Refresh-Build-Buy growth initiatives as follows:

• | Refresh. Refreshing our existing assets, experiences, and processes to optimize market position and maximize returns

• | Buy. Buying strategic assets that complement our portfolio and generate strong returns on investment.
