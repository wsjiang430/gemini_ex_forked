Our customers include leading service providers (cloud, telecommunications, multiple system operators, cable), government organizations, and enterprises. 
Industry Trends & Market Drivers
The digitization of business has made applications a critical ingredient in virtually every aspect of operations. The safety and efficiency of applications can directly impact business and financial performance, and security shortfalls can impact brand value and customer retention. The application networking and security industry is experiencing dynamic shifts in the way applications are developed, delivered, monetized and protected. Our corporate strategy and technology address these evolving needs of our customers and industry, including:
Increased Adoption of Cloud Applications. For decades, businesses operated with applications based in physical, appliance-based data centers. While these traditional applications remain central to businesses around the world, a new genre of cloud-based applications is emerging, presenting new opportunities and challenges that require organizations to reassess the visibility, performance and security of their applications. Some of these challenges relate to how a business effectively manages secure application services across various data centers and cloud types, whether private, public or hybrid clouds. Over time, more and more applications may be born in the cloud, while some applications that existed in traditional data centers may migrate to clouds as well. To address this shift, businesses will need solutions that bridge both traditional and cloud-based application environments and centrally manage all secure application services holistically in this multi-cloud world. 
Increased Network Complexity and New Infrastructure Paradigms. Traditional IT vendors may need to shift from hardware-centric models to software-defined approaches across several operating environments to improve agility for critical applications, and subsequently, their business operations. Ensuring product portfolios adapt and diversify to include newer virtualized software, container-based software and cloud-based offerings are key factors determining future market leadership and competitive landscapes.
Growing Importance of Automation and Orchestration. As applications increasingly move to a multi-cloud environment, the deployment of orchestration and automation tools has become essential to efficiently automating the deployment and operations of security and application services. There is a need for increased operational efficiency and agility, improved detection and reporting of security anomalies, enhanced end-user experiences and reduced total cost of ownership (“TCO”), simplified management of distributed application services, improved capacity planning and optimized multi-cloud software lifecycle management. By deploying newly developed secure application delivery automation and predictive analytics tools, enterprises are able to visualize their application performance, detect anomalous trends and fully automate their application delivery and network security. 
The Rise of DDoS Attacks. The cyberthreat landscape continues to intensify and grow. Malicious actors and cybercriminals such as hacktivists, amateur hackers, and foreign military and intelligence organizations target data centers of every type. Distributed Denial of Service (“DDoS”) attacks are increasing in size, frequency, complexity and notoriety. IT defenders are faced with the increasing sophistication of adversaries who are responsible for the size and frequency of these attacks. 
A DDoS attack seeks to render a target network or website unavailable by orchestrating coordinated attacks from massive worldwide networks of compromised endpoints, called botnets. Compromised endpoints can be computing devices or “Internet of Things” driven devices like video cameras. Any internet-connected device can be vulnerable to hackers and utilized as part of a botnet.
Rapid growth of TLS, SSL, Encrypted Applications and Hidden Threats. Many applications use Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) and Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) protocols. Cyber criminals exploit the protocol to hide malicious malware within encrypted channels and carry out attacks against businesses and users. This malicious trend drives demand for greater visibility within SSL-encrypted channels. Businesses need a way to decrypt traffic and apply outbound security policies efficiently, and require an effective way to inspect, identify, and remediate malicious traffic, then re-encrypt traffic and deliver it quickly to its destination. Conducting this process efficiently without placing a “security performance tax” on the user experience is a critical requirement. 
The Advent of 5G Networks and a Smart World. The growing deployment of commercial 5G networks will bring massive increases in network throughput and significant new business opportunities for mobile carriers. It will also require a new generation of security infrastructure capable of handling the growing capacity requirements and complex management needs of 5G networks. Capacity requirements increase dramatically in 5G networks due to substantial increases in concurrent sessions, lower packet size and higher connections per second. Operators must dramatically lower latency, reduce total cost of ownership, and improve efficiency which may require advanced consolidation of network functions at the core. Meanwhile, the scope and size of DDoS attacks may also increase dramatically with the proliferation of connected devices and traffic, due in large part to the expansion of Internet of Things (“IoT”)/Machine-to-Machine traffic coming from new 5G-delivered Smart World applications. To address these requirements, mobile operators will need new solutions that provide hyperscale and increased performance, richer feature sets, and rich automation, analytics and threat intelligence.
Need for Advanced Multi-Cloud Secure Application Service Solutions. To address these challenges, advanced and integrated solutions for managing secure application services across businesses’ application environments are needed. Of the many solution requirements, some of the more critical include:
•Ability to Centrally Manage Traditional and Cloud Environments. As more applications are born in the cloud, and they operate alongside traditional applications supported by on-premise and appliance-based data centers, application delivery and security solutions will be called upon to span traditional and cloud-based environments. In doing so, solutions must centrally control and manage secure application services across any combination of traditional data centers and a myriad of different clouds. To support data centers and different cloud types, solutions require a variety of form factors: hardware, software (i.e., virtual, bare metal and containers) and cloud-based offerings.
•Clear Visibility and Sophisticated Analytics. The effectiveness of application performance and security depends greatly on the level of visibility a business has into its application traffic. That visibility must be able to span any number of data centers and cloud types to ensure a holistic view of security threats and performance issues affecting applications. The deeper and clearer the visibility, the better the analytics and actionable information that can be applied to enhancing application performance and protection. Secure application service solutions must be driven by solid visibility and per-app analytics.
•Ability to Scale. Performance and security at scale are paramount in today’s dynamic application environments. Solutions need to analyze application traffic quickly and enhance performance and security in traditional and cloud-based application environments in a centrally managed manner. With the rapid adoption of IoT devices, and the advent of 5G, we believe a solution’s ability to perform at scale will be increasingly imperative.
•Sophisticated Security Functionality. Secure application service solutions must detect and mitigate sophisticated cybersecurity threats, such as malicious threats hiding in encrypted traffic and DDoS attacks. To defend against the rising volume of sophisticated cyber-attacks, solutions require exceptional performance and scale without dramatically increasing footprint and total cost of ownership.

Underlying Technology
Since our inception, our solutions have been known for their high performance and scalability in some of the largest and most demanding networks. The value and significance of our high-performance offerings reside in our portfolio’s underlying software operating system. With the exception of Lightning ADC, our products are built on the Advanced Core Operating System (“ACOS”) platform and leverage its performance optimization and security features.
The ACOS platform is optimized for modern 64-bit central processing units (“CPUs”), which increasingly have multiple parallel processing cores that operate within a single CPU for higher efficiency and performance scalability. To maximize the capabilities of these increasingly dense multi-core CPUs, ACOS implements a proprietary shared memory architecture that provides all cores with simultaneous access to common memory. This shared memory software architecture enables our products to utilize these multi-core CPUs efficiently and scale performance with increasing CPU cores. As a result, ACOS provides customers with products that can deliver superior price performance benefits over products that lack these capabilities.
ACOS’ high-performance design enables our products to address a wide range of performance-driven networking challenges. The flexible software design of ACOS allows us to apply our portfolio to a variety of markets for a variety of needs. Some notable details about ACOS include:
High Performance and Intelligent Network Input/Output (“I/O”) Processing. In order to maximize the efficiency of high density, multi-core processors, we have developed a high-performance intelligent network I/O technology that can balance application traffic flows equitably across processor cores. Our Flexible Traffic Accelerator logic can be implemented either as software running within a standard x86 processor or a Field Programmable Gate Array (“FPGA”) semiconductor. Our Flexible Traffic Accelerator (“FTA”) also performs certain hardware-based security checks for each packet and can isolate suspicious traffic before it can impact system performance.
Scalable and Efficient Memory Usage. To improve the performance of the multi-core processor architecture, we have developed a shared memory technology to allow all processors to share common memory and the state of the system simultaneously. This avoids the overhead associated with Inter-Processor Communication architectures deployed in first-generation approaches. We optimize memory to be visible to all cores simultaneously, while minimizing communication overhead and contention among processors for allocated memory space. All processors share a common memory pool, which dynamically allocates memory space based on application processing requirements without constraints. Customers can achieve greater performance and scalability from memory and processor resources because configurations, policies and network databases are efficiently stored within a shared memory architecture.
Optimized Application Networking and Security. Once data is processed and placed into a shared memory, a processor can begin to apply ACOS common services and function-specific logic. To ensure that every processor is utilized to perform every function and thereby achieve greater system utilization, ACOS uses all processor cores 
symmetrically for all functions and services. The ACOS common services perform a set of key operational functions, including configuration management, network I/O, aFleX scripting, Virtual Chassis System (“aVCS”), aXAPI for management integration, Application Delivery Partitions (“ADPs”), virtualization to enable multi-tenancy, and common resource management such as buffer, system memory, timer management and other internal system management tasks. ACOS features a modular software design, which improves reliability by ensuring that modifications made to one module will not have unwanted side effects on other system functions.
Other noteworthy ACOS Technologies. ACOS incorporates a number of other technologies to provide a rich environment for developing Layer 4-7 application networking solutions, including:
• aFleX Scripting. aFleX scripting technology is based on industry-standard tool command language and enables customers to write custom scripts to augment the application processing.
• ADP. ADP enables multi-tenancy in the ACOS common services so that multiple departments of an organization or multiple customers can share a physical/virtual appliance.
• aVCS. aVCS enables multiple physical/virtual appliances to be managed as a single chassis.
• aXAPI. aXAPI is an industry standard representational state transfer (“RESTful”) program interface to enable management integration for automated management.

We may continue to grow our sales headcount, including in geographies where we currently do not have a sales presence.
Some customer sales are originated and completed by our Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) and distribution channel partners with little or no direct engagement with our sales personnel. We fulfill nearly all orders globally through our distribution channel partners, which include distributors, value added resellers and system integrators. Revenue fulfilled through our distribution channel partners accounted for 83%, 89% and 91% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Marketing
Our strategy is focused on driving greater demand for our products and services, and enabling sales to win as that demand broadens. Our marketing drives global demand generation campaigns, as well as additional awareness and demand via joint marketing campaigns with channel partners and strategic alliance partners worldwide. Our marketing also drives global awareness through industry analyst engagement, media outreach, blogs, social media and events. 
Manufacturing
We outsource the manufacturing of our hardware products to original design manufacturers. This approach allows us to benefit from the scale and experience of our manufacturing partners to reduce our costs, overhead and inventory while allowing us to adjust more quickly to changing customer demand. Our manufacturers are Lanner Electronics Inc. (“Lanner”), AEWIN Technologies Co., Ltd. (“AEWIN”) and iBase. These companies manufacture and assemble our hardware products using design specifications, quality assurance programs and standards established by us. Our manufacturers procure components and assemble our products based on our demand forecasts and purchase orders. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based on historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. 
We have agreements with Lanner with an initial term of one year and AEWIN with an initial term of six years pursuant to which they manufacture, assemble, and test our products. Each agreement automatically renews for successive one-year terms unless either party gives notice that they do not want to renew. We do not have any long-term manufacturing contracts that guarantee fixed capacity or pricing. Quality assurance and testing is performed at our San Jose, Taiwan and Japan distribution centers, as well as at our manufacturers’ locations. We warehouse and deliver our products out of our San Jose warehouse for the Americas and direct from Taiwan for APAC and EMEA. We outsource delivery to a third-party logistics provider for deliveries in Japan.
Backlog 
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had product backlog of approximately $8.1 million and $10.9 million, respectively. Backlog represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped generally within 90 days to customers with approved credit status. Orders may be subject to cancellation, rescheduling by customers and product specification changes by customers. Although we believe that the backlog orders are firm, purchase orders may be canceled by the customer prior to shipment without significant penalty. For this reason, we believe that our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues.
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our total revenue was $280.3 million, $250.0 million, and $225.5 million, respectively, and our gross margin was 79.7%, 78.6%, and 77.8%, respectively. We had net income of $46.9 million, $94.9 million and $17.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Intellectual Property 
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. As of December 31, 2022, we had 212 United States (“U.S.”) patents issued and 4 U.S. patent applications pending, and 77 overseas patents issued and 12 overseas patent applications pending. Our issued U.S. patents, excluding 17 patents that we acquired, expire between 2025 and 2039. Our issued overseas patents, excluding 5 patents 
that we acquired, expire between 2027 and 2037. Our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States. Any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position, and competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology. Our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
 We license software from third parties for development of, or integration into, our products, including proprietary and open source software. We pursue registration of our trademarks and domain names in the United States and other jurisdictions. See Part I, Item 1A.

Employees have an opportunity for financial inclusion at A10 Networks with an ownership interest in our company. There are several programs that provide employees with the ability to own our stock. Generally, more than 75% of our employees participates in at least one of our stock programs. During their tenure with our company, most employees have an opportunity to receive an equity award, either upon hire and/or during an annual review process to recognize those with significant impact on achieving our goals.
