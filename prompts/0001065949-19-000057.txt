Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 101 of the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) as we did not have more than $1,000,000,000 in annual gross revenue and did not have such amount as of December 31, 2018, our last fiscal year.
 
We may lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year during which (i) our annual gross revenue exceeds $1,000,000,000 or (ii) we issue more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt in a three-year period. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company if at any time we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement.
 
As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable to generally reporting companies. These provisions include:
 

- | A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statement and only two years of related Management Discussion and Analysis Disclosures:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such sections are provided below:
 
Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires a public company’s auditor to attest to, and report on, management’s assessment of its internal controls.
 
Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities and Exchange Act, implemented by Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act, require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation.
 
We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this Form 10-K, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
 
As long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing to irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act. 
 
HISTORY
 
We were originally incorporated in 1988 in the state of Florida. TPT Global, Inc., a Nevada corporation formed in June 2014, merged with Ally Pharma US, Inc., a Florida corporation, (“Ally Pharma”, formerly known as Gold Royalty Corporation) in a “reverse merger” wherein Ally Pharma issued 110,000,000 shares of Common Stock, or 80% ownership, to the owners of TPT Global, Inc. and Ally Pharma changed its name to TPT Global Tech, Inc. In 2014, we acquired all the assets of K Telecom and Wireless LLC (“K Telecom”) and Global Telecom International, LLC (“Global Telecom”). Effective January 31, 2015, we completed our acquisition of 100% of the outstanding stock of Copperhead Digital Holdings, Inc. (“Copperhead Digital”) and Subsidiaries, TruCom, LLC (“TruCom”), Nevada Utilities, Inc. (“Nevada Utilities”) and CityNet Arizona, LLC (“CityNet”). In October 2015, we acquired the assets of both Port2Port, Inc. (“Port2Port”) and Digithrive, Inc. (“Digithrive”). Effective September 30, 2016, we

CURRENT BUSINESS
 
Company Overview 
 
Through key acquisitions, in 2015 we launched wholesale and retail operations in the United States and Internationally. These first acquisitions with their customer bases, Distribution Channels and Technology are the base for our organic growth strategy opportunities to cross pollinate or sell our planned New Generation, New Media Technology products and services, Domestically and Internationally.
 
We, and our related companies and acquisitions, are seeking to be an innovative Telecom/CUBS (Cloud Unified Businesses Services) as one of the first to combine recurring Telecom, Mobile Banking, Media and Data/Cloud Services revenue under one roof, and then bring all relevant data from those services into a proprietary information matrix platform capable of delivering a “Daily and Intelligent Dashboard” to our Domestic and International customers. Such a cohesive combination of services and information from a single provider has been heretofore nonexistent. We intend to pioneer an integrated communication services and information technology suite, to empower companies with vital communications services technology, and highly relevant diagnostic information.
 
To date we have generated revenues primarily through operating as a Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (“CLEC”) in Arizona. Our primary revenues in 2018 and 2017 are primarily from telecommunications services and products.
 
Our operating divisions historically have been those that sell telecommunications services and those that sale telecommunications products. Cloud based services assets were acquired in 2016 and are intended to be more of a contributing factor to revenues in 2019 and forward.
 
Our Key Divisions: K Telecom and Global Telecom- GSM Distribution
 
K Telecom and Global Telecom are located in the Northwest of the United States and sell and distribute GSM Cell Phone and Prepaid GSM Services for MVNO’s (Mobile Virtual Network Operators) through approximately 100 brick and mortar retail store-front locations in Washington and Oregon.
 
Our TruCom, LLC– CLEC–Phoenix, Arizona
 
Our TruCom division, a subsidiary of Copperhead Digital Holdings, LLC, is a Facilities Based Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC) headquartered in Phoenix, AZ. Founded in 2006 (as Copperhead Digital Carrier) for the purpose of operating a state-of-the-art Fiber Optic Network constructed by and acquired from Adelphia Communications, TruCom now operates its own carrier class Fiber Optic Network, state-of-the-art Wireless Point-to-Point network, and Patent Pending proprietary “Bulletproof”™ technology seamlessly integrating the two.
 
TruCom offers Phone, Internet, Fiber Optic, Wireless, Hosted PBX, Wi-Fi, Wi-Max, Engineering, Cabling, Wiring and Cloud services. With a penchant for pushing the envelope, TruCom has pioneered innovative, hosted firewall and managed MPLS service technologies (SuperCore MPLS™) and was the Industry first to engineer patent-pending failover services utilizing our own fiber optic and wireless networks to guarantee business continuity and service uptime. Located in multiple Local Serving Offices and Points of Presence (POP’s) in the primary Data Centers in the market, TruCom’s extensive Fiber Optic Network runs through the heart of the most densely populated corridors of the Greater Phoenix Metro Area. Their Wireless Point to Point and Point to Multipoint Network is fed by the infinitely scalable capacity of the Fiber Optic Network and consists of more than 16 Major Access Points. This footprint not only provides coverage throughout the metro area, but also spans into outlying Cities, often providing the only carrier grade solution available in the region. TruCom’s substantial Network Assets, Innovative Service Offerings, and Dedicated Customer Service have driven a substantial increase in revenue each year over the past several years.

Our Port2Port Assets
 
We acquired assets that relate to reseller call termination both domestically and internationally in Dallas Texas of Port2Port. These assets provide approximately 100 Domestic and international customers and vendors terminating wholesale calls domestically and internationally.
Our San Diego Media Division

(“SDM”)(www.sandiegomedia.com) is an established Southern California based software engineering and Internet e-commerce marketing services company that provides enterprise-class integrated solutions for manufacturers, retailers, and distributors focused on developing solutions for companies seeking online growth and profitability.
 
Founded in 1999, historically the primary market offering has been MaxEXP®, a proven stable, productivity-enabling proprietary eCommerce platform, built on open-standards technology that empowers companies to deploy and manage eCommerce offerings at lower cost and at less time than required to deploy more conventional high-end solutions — and, we believe, all without sacrificing the essential merchandising functionality, customizability, extensibility, scalability, security, and performance that much more expensive solutions provide. MaxEXP supports both B2B and B2C functionality simultaneously which few other eCommerce solutions will provide successfully out-of-the-box.
 
These early engagements have enabled SDM to solidify and refine the core SDM technology architecture and to enhance the platform with market-driven merchandising features and functionality. SDM has made significant R&D investments in operational infrastructure including sophisticated monitoring systems, comprehensive security, time-tracking, client management tools, and continuous compliance with the demanding payment card industry (PCI) standards.
 
SDM has complemented these systems with a full range of automated and enterprise-class capabilities for fully integrating with customer’s legacy systems, call centers, fulfillment houses, and other critical business process applications.
 
SDM has complimented its technologies with a wider range of professional internet and marketing services that enables client success, to create successful business relationships over long-term.
 
As the market has changed through the years SDM has continued to innovate and expand its strategic and technology development partnerships; these include, MIndTouch, BigCommerce, Avalara, CPC Strategies, eBridge, Imperva Incapsula, Chris Chase Design. SDM’s newest client is based in Singapore and it represents its most innovative use of technologies to date.

TPT Global Tech is headquartered in San Diego, California and operates as a holding company for its Media, Smartphone, Network, Content and SaaS (Software as a Services) domestic and international businesses.
 
Historically and through key acquisitions we launched Telecommunications wholesale and retail operations in the United States and Internationally.

Our technologies “Gathers Big Data” to predict our customers’ viewing and spending habits. We then deliver Products and Services to support that estimated demand and share advertising revenues with our Content, Digital Media and Linear Broadcast Partners worldwide.
 
Each of our four divisions contributes to the launch of our global Content delivery platform “ViewMe Live” and creates cross pollinating revenue opportunities and a closed Global E-commerce Eco environment which we believe will help us execute our short and long term corporate objectives. Our Content Division which consists of Blue Collar Productions (our TV and Film content Production company) creates original content and in some cases third party content. Once Content has been produced we will then broadcast and delivered that content over our proprietary Mobile TV Platform on our proprietary Trucom Telecommunication Network infrastructure domestically and internationally.

We, and our related acquired companies are seeking to be an innovative Media-Telecom/CUBS (Cloud Unified Businesses Services) company and one of the first to combine recurring Telecom, Media and Data/Cloud Services revenue under one roof, then bring all relevant data from those services into a proprietary telecom infrastructure and information matrix platform capable of delivering a “Daily and Intelligent Dashboard” to our Domestic and International customers.

 Our Business Methods
 
Centralized Platform and New Generation Network
 
We are now operating a next-generation broadband network reselling other companies’ networks on a wholesale arbitrage basis (buying and reselling other companies’ capacity) on our centralized VIVO Platform. We are interconnected to U.S. and International carriers to date. Once funded, we intend to deploy our own in-country networks in the targeted emerging markets. This will enable us to be able to provide better quality termination and increase our operating margins. We believe our platform will produce substantial operational cost savings. Because of our pricing advantage, we are able to offer our clients products and services at an attractive pricing structure, creating a strong competitive advantage. Based on our low network operating costs and low-cost infrastructure, we believe we may penetrate emerging markets with little network build-out and at a reasonable price. Management believes that our service offerings will be well received in emerging markets based on existing relationships and pricing structure, which will enable us to set the industry standard with little competition.
 
Once we establish in-country networks, we will be able to market Phones, Networks, Content and SaaS products targeted to specific subgroups that coincide with the country/region where we have a network in place or a strategic partnership network in place.
 
Use of Incumbent Networks
 
Under formal agreements we can privately brand and resell incumbent carriers’ underlying broadband networks, while deploying our own Wimax/Wi-Fi/GSM service plans and mobile handsets.
 
As a true value add, our VIVO billing platform allows us to manage the billing and routing, offering our customers a seamless, branded network from anywhere we maintain a relationship. By way of incumbent operator networks, we can sell and market to retail and wholesale customers without the high infrastructure costs associated with deploying our own network. If and when the revenues justify the cost of constructing our own network, we plan to investigate adding a wireless Broadband/ GSM network, and transfer our customer base in a final step to reduce costs of goods sold long-term.
Wholesale Termination
 
Wholesale termination is the reselling of excess network capacity on a reciprocal basis to other telecom carriers both domestically and internationally. Due to the large number of carrier relationships we have in the US and abroad, we believe we can immediately increase our wholesale termination in each country in which we have a license to operate. This wholesale activity generates additional cash flow immediately if successfully implemented. Wholesale termination is a low risk, low margin business.
Service Description
 
Our next-generation wireless Broadband/GSM network relies on non-line-of-sight technology. This will provide a level of performance comparable to that delivered by evolving Worldwide Interoperability of Microwave Access (WiMAX) standards. The cost advantage equates to substantial reductions of fixed costs as compared to building traditional, legacy, and switched networks.
 
Our products and marketing strategy unifies the various features available in today’s telecommunication environment including:

SpeedConnect Asset Acquisition
 
On April 3, 2019, the Company initiated the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of SpeedConnect LLC (“SpeedConnect”) for $2 million, including the assumption of all contracts and liabilities pertinent to operations. SpeedConnect was founded in 2002 by its CEO John Arthur Ogren and is in its 17th year of operations as a national, predominantly rural, wireless telecommunications residential and commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP). The

acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of April 2019. SpeedConnect’s primary business model is subscription based, monthly reoccurring revenues, from wireless delivered, high-speed Internet connections utilizing its company built and owned national network. SpeedConnect also resells third-party satellite Internet, DSL Internet, IP telephony and DISH TV products. Mr. Ogren will stay on as the CEO of SpeedConnect for TPTG for the next two years.
 
SpeedConnect is a privately-held Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) provider. Today, SpeedConnect is one of the nation’s largest rural wireless broadband Internet providers which serves over 25,000 residential and commercial wireless broadband Internet customers, in Arizona, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Texas. 
 
SpeedConnect is a full-service ISP. The company’s Frankenmuth Michigan back office is run by company employees, and includes, network management, network monitoring and maintenance, significant allocations of registered address in public IP4 and IP6 space, employee based customer service, installation services, automated resources and application based scheduling and tracking, paper, ACH, credit card, and email billing, warehousing, fulfillment, integrated customer premise provisioning, walled garden collections and customer self-restarts, bandwidth usage tracking, integrated, secure, and deep financial and operations dash board reporting, collections, accounting, payables, owned and licensed backhaul, intelligent bandwidth management, consumption rated billing, customer payment portals, and all wrapped in a mature, first hit on all search engines, Internet Brand. The company today services 25,000 residential and commercial Internet customers over its 220-cellular tower foot-print across 10 Midwestern States.
 
Today’s urban ISP landscape is highly competitive and dominated by some of the world’s largest going concerns. Names like Comcast, AT&T, Cox, Charter and DISH are household words. Home Internet service has become synonymous with Cable. However, this is limited to the high-density top 100 markets. Beyond that the competition becomes more small licensed free wireless providers and satellite. Wire-line providers, unless backed with government subsidies, do not build beyond 15 homes per street mile. SpeedConnect services both rural and non-rural areas, and historically has done well in both market places, however the margins are improved in the more rural areas due to reduced voluntary and involuntary customer attrition.
 
SpeedConnect’s key suppliers include but are not limited to; Great Lakes Data Systems, Juniper, ZTE, Huawei, Cisco, Sandvine, American Tower, SBA Tower, Crown Castle, CenturyLink, SuddenLink, South Dakota Networks, 123 dot net, Genesee Telephone, Air Advantage Fiber, Iron Mountain, ConVergence, CDW, Talley, Tessco, Bursma Electronics, DragonWave, Ceragon Networks, Telrad, Arris, AP, APD, Plante Morran, Fifth Third, Sprint and others.

PURSUE BRAND RECOGNITION THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES
 
The first marketing objective must be to refine our brand and secure our place in the minds of the consumers. This will be accomplished through the execution of an integrated branding, identity and services marketing programs. The goals for this segment will be an enhanced brand identity, a brand applications and a digital assets suite.
MARKETING STRATEGY
 
Our plan includes a direct sales program targeting businesses, small business and home office users of communications. The direct sales efforts will be supported with third party marketing integration. To further enhance the sales process, we will offer an offering program including services and product sheets, coupons, point of sale materials (banners, shelf talkers, and end cap displays and danglers) and internet marketing programs.
 
Based on the above benefit scenarios, we plan to seize the following opportunities:
 

Build superior brand recognition and become recognized as a category
leader.
Expand the US distribution into all states.
Establish distribution internationally.
Establish and manage a knowledgeable team of account executives
with industry experience.
Create a retail merchandising program that will build a strong
market share.

 
The purpose of our marketing efforts is to move the product sales from their current position into the rapid growing “popularity” stage. Our strategy includes the following marketing programs: Branding; Merchandising; Direct; Display Advertising; Media; Public Relations; Publicity; Events; Investor Relations; Metrics Dashboard; and, Personal Sales. Our objective is to gain the sales momentum required to reach the “brand preference” stage of product growth as soon as possible. This is the stage where we plan sales grow at a steady and stabilized pace.
 
THE DIRECT MARKETING PROGRAM
 
A complete direct marketing program including direct mail, blast email and URLs may be used to introduce the products to new customers and secure leads for the sales team. We plan to employ the services of a database marketing company to leverage techniques to target prospective clients and reinforce product messages throughout the selling process. This process will commence with the modeling of our existing customer data and the analysis of the results using sophisticated analytic tools. Cross-channel marketing will be utilized in conjunction with the direct marketing including social marketing. Our focus of this marketing medium will be relevance and timing, which only this medium can provide full control over and the ability to fully quantify the results.
THE MEDIA MARKETING PROGRAM
 
We intend to test several media options to determine which, if any, effectively drive sales and sales leads. The mediums being consider include outdoor advertising, both static and mobile, magazine ads, and radio spots. Other media to be explored are direct mail post cards and emails to opt in viewers.
THE PUBLIC RELATIONS/PUBLICITY PROGRAM
 
We plan to employ the services of a public relations firm to build a corporate profile to keep the name and the services and products in front of consumers. A third-party PR firm will be responsible for writing and publishing press releases, coordinating event marketing and managing investor relations.
 
We employ marketing, sales and customer service personnel on an as needed basis for specific events to build brand awareness. We use a range of marketing strategies and tactics to build our brand and increase sales, including point-
 of-sale materials, event sponsorship, in-store and on premise promotions, public relations, and a variety of other traditional and non-traditional marketing techniques to support the sales of all of our products.
 

17
--

We believe that a marketing mix of event promotions, social media, print advertising in local media and internet advertising providing information and samples of our products at social events is a strategy that may help increase sales.
 
TARGET CUSTOMER
 
We plan to profile our existing customers and create a sophisticated data model to mathematically and statistically identify our “ideal” customer. Further the model will be used to learn exactly how the target customer wishes to be communicated with and marketed to.
THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET
 
We plan to market our product internationally. Many of the current products offered by us have features for the international community. This will be a secondary but strong focus by our marketing team.
EXPERIENCED MANAGEMENT
 
Our senior management team has over 30 years of experience in the various consumer product industries and has a proven track record of creating value both organically and through strategic acquisitions. Our management intends to utilize the best available and fit-for-purpose technology and experienced contractors to improve production and expand distribution.
CORPORATE STRATEGY
 
Our Goals
 
Our primary goal is to continue to grow our business by improving value to our current customers and vendors. In providing a high-quality network we intend to continue to grow our business. Additionally, we intend to purchase established telecommunications and technology companies that will immediately generate and increase traffic (revenue) to our Company’s retail and wholesale network. Companies that we are strategically aligned with have in their core business synergistic retail products and services that include, but are not limited to, Telecom Cloud Services Media, Merchant Services/Mobile Banking, Cloud Services and Media (e.g. credit/debit card processing, check/ACH payment processing, ecommerce/merchant processing, web hosting, voice, data, GSM/Wi-Fi Mobile, Mobile Money Transfers, IPTV, VOD and Live Mobile Broadcasting, Prepaid Calling Card and PIN-less Prepaid services). If we acquire a strategic partner as a subsidiary, we believe we will have the ability to aggregate their analogous technology platforms onto our proprietary Software Access System operating platform for integration and efficiency.
 
We intend to work our media to accelerate cohesively in the mobile technology sectors: LIVE Broadcast, Video on Demand (VOD) Apps, and Digital Video Magazine (DVM) Apps. While “white labeling” our technologies as SaaS, our primary focus is what we believe is the first Global Cyber LIVE Mobile TV broadcast network, ViewMe Live. The ViewMe Live Network™ is a 24-hour LIVE worldwide mobile TV network, delivered via iOS and Android apps. The ViewMe Live Network™ presents a diversity of Linear Broadcast Channels (Domestically and International), coupled with Social Media Platforms with combined functions that compete with some of the largest and most powerful Digital Media platforms, to connected audiences who live a mobile-centric life.

DEVELOPMENT FLOW CHART
  



Network Services
 Domestic and Global Telecommunications offerings include: Mobile TV, Phone, Internet, Fiber Optic, Wireless, Hosted PBX, Wi-Fi, Wi-Max, Engineering, Cabling, Wiring and Cloud services. Our telecommunications division has pioneered innovative, hosted firewall and managed MPLS service technologies (SuperCore MPLS) and was the Industry first to engineer patent-pending Bulletproof™ failover services utilizing our own fiber optic and wireless networks to guarantee business continuity and service uptime.
 
As a retail and business media and telecommunications provider operating a high-speed Fiber Optic Network and Wireless Network in the USA at a cost competitive rate for new technologies, we are growing our operations through sales of our core voice & data connectivity products to small and midsized business clients. We have a growth strategy through acquisitions in order to increase regional operations and deploy more technologies to niche & underserved markets. Unified Cloud Services, Unified Communications (UC) or Unified Communications/Collaboration (UCC) has been a topic of interest to users looking to evolve from a disorderly combination of media, voice, email and message communications to something more structured. Our goal is to target existing and new small and medium businesses (“SMBs”) to transition their older voice system businesses, expand their software collaboration offerings, and most recently build cloud service offerings. Cloud solution gives our customers the flexibility to support a myriad of mobile devices as part of their hardware strategy, whether it's launching a bring-your-own-device initiative, implementing a one-to-one program or equipping SMBs with mobile computing carts full of tablets, netbooks, or notebooks in a secured environment.
 
Scalability and Cost Efficiency
 
Our proprietary Software Access System platform currently runs our global operations. In short, it does this by connecting our customer base with the most profitable vendor route while calculating least cost routing, analyzing route quality, and respecting “dipping” protocols. Based on the demand, we have the ability to scale to meet the needs of our customers. Comparable “off the shelf” software systems in the marketplace can cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars just to purchase, not to mention expensive service contracts, which may continue in perpetuity

We support our distribution through digital advertising, events, television advertising, website promotions and public relations.
 
Marketing Designs
 
We have designed our services and products offered to be:
 

· | Portable. We offer the ability to access our network from anywhere within our coverage area without being restricted to a specific location. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Simple. Our services are easy to install. After connecting our modem to an ATA or computer and a power source, our wireless broadband service is immediately available and requires no software installation.
· | Fast. We offer speeds that typically exceed legacy cellular networks and are competitive with fixed broadband offerings. 
· | A Good Value. We generally price our services competitively because our costs to build and operate our network are significantly lower than the networks operated by many of our competitors. 

 
With the popularity of social media, people are demanding fast broadband connectivity on an increasingly mobile basis. We believe that our services meet this demand and will market this in our efforts to increase our subscriber growth rate.
 
OUR COMPANY STRENGTHS
 
We believe the following competitive strengths enable us to meet the demand for simple, reliable and portable wireless broadband connectivity:
 
·         First mover. We are the first company we are aware of to launch a Global Cyber Mobile TV and Social Media Network that incorporates functional feature of the largest Digital Media companies in the world. ​
 ·         High barriers to entry. Our issued and pending patents, as well as our proprietary Media platforms and Naked Eye 3D technology trade secrets give us a strong intellectual property position that we believe creates a significant barrier to entry for potential competitors. ​

21
--

·         Broad range of applications for our platform. This allows us to build a deep new product pipeline that creates multiple paths to build a large and profitable business. 
 
·         Multi-billion-dollar addressable market. U.S. digital advertising revenues rose to $26.2 billion in the third quarter of 2018, solidifying 2018’s claim as the highest-spending first three quarters on record, according to the latest IAB Internet Advertising Revenue Report released today by IAB and prepared by PwC US. Digital spend for Q3 2018 estimates increased 20.6 percent over Q3 2017. In total, marketers spent $75.8 billion during 2018’s first three quarters—22 percent more than they had spent during the same period a year ago.
 https://iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IAB_Internet-Ad-Revenue-Report-Q3-2018_2019-02-14_FINAL-1.pdf
 ·         Diverse revenue streams including Digital Media partnerships. We anticipate generating significant revenue from our Digital Media platforms. Our Linear Broadcast partners will play a large part in generating revenues from the sale of mobile and social media advertising. ​
 ·         Strong senior leadership team. Our founders and senior leaders have experience in building and operating several companies in our business areas. We have phone, network, content, SaaS, product development, and commercialization experience that has enabled us to establish market leadership positions for the companies where we previously were employed. 
 ·         Differentiated Services. We believe our service is unique because of our combination of our Worldwide Operational Platform, Worldwide Affiliates, Cutting Edge Technology, Portability, Simplicity and Speed to Market with a competitive domestic and International Price Structure. We believe this combination of factors differentiates our subscriber’s experience when compared to broadband services provided by DSL, cable modem, wireless third-generation or 3G, networks.
·         Strong Spectrum Position. We use unlicensed and licensed spectrum (in Arizona), which avoids radio frequency interference that hinders competitors using non-licensed spectrum, such as WiFi network operators. Access to spectrum is a fundamental barrier to entry for the delivery of high-quality wireless communications. Through our partnerships, we believe that we have access to the second largest spectrum position in our band within the United States. 
 ·         Advanced, Scalable Technology. Because we intend to design our own software and equipment, we can refine our product development roadmap to meet our subscriber’s needs. We believe our NLOS, IP-based Ethernet architecture and compression technology confers competitive advantages since it simplifies both network deployment and customer use while supporting a broad range of potential premium services. 
 ·         Efficient Economic Model. We believe our individual market economic model is characterized by low fixed capital and operating expenditures relative to other wireless and wire line broadband service providers. We believe our individual market model is highly scalable and replicable across our markets. As our capabilities evolve, we expect to generate incremental revenue streams from our subscriber base by developing and offering premium products and services. 
 ·         Experienced Management Team. Stephen J. Thomas, our Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer, has been an active entrepreneur, operator and investor in the industry for more than 17 years in VoIP and wireless communications industry. He previously served as Director of Network Optimization/Validation for WorldxChange, Inc. and CEO and President of New Orbit Communications, Inc., which focused on International Operator Services in United States, Mexico, El Salvador and Guatemala.
 
FUTURE PLANS

We are currently seeking a manufacturer for our Lion Smart Phone. Our Management believes our patent pending Lion smart phone is the first Full HD Naked Eye 3D smart phone ever launched in the United States. Lion Universe’s mobile 3D technology is patent pending. The smart phone will be distributed through our wholly-owned subsidiary K-TEL, in their existing brick and mortar distribution channel in the Northwest expanding into other areas.

phones come equipped with full high definition resolution screen for better viewing. We believe this Full HD Naked Eye 3D smart Phone is perfect for watching movies, playing games, even editing photos or videos.
 
Whether that is looking at photos, playing music, emailing or surfing the web, our management believes consumers want more from their phones. We believe our Lion Phone raises the bar for cellular phones. For the first time ever, cellular users can enjoy quality 3D viewing with the naked eyes no glasses required enjoying full high definition video with smooth playback.
    Our Management believes consumers have been waiting for a way to watch their favorite movies in 3D, with the convenience of their phone and gamers can have the leisure of playing their games without taking all head gear with them. Our Lion Universe Technology strives to give customers the best possible experience with our Full HD Naked Eye 3D smart phone in the US and Global markets.
 
We intend to market this phone in 2019.
 
Mobile Device Viewer Market Expansion
 
In general, viewers are consuming more content via mobile TV distribution, while rapidly abandoning expensive subscriptions from standard satellite TV and cable networks. The rise of high-quality content on low-cost platforms, such as mobile devices, continues to negatively impact the standard TV industry. The media business is being forced to evolve and adjust to massive disruptions in content distribution methods. Traditional media models are functionally broken and will continue to be disrupted by technology, which is driven by the needs of the younger generation. The future of media is dependent on new technology platforms. These platform models (e.g. smart TV, connected TV boxes, mobile TV devices) are the future of content distribution. Google, through YouTube, has changed the face of video content distribution. Amazon continues to disrupt the book industry. Apple has redefined music and application distribution. And Microsoft is continuing to change the engagement model and distribution of content through its Xbox TV game console.


We believe mobile delivery has a growing appeal to advertisers and subscribers. As brands continue to shift budgets to mobile advertising, they must reassess their approach to customer acquisition to ensure they continue to reach potential customers effectively. It is predicted that mobile advertising will account for 30.5% of global advertising expenditure in 2020, up from 19.2% in 2017. Expenditure on mobile advertising will total US$187bn in 2020, more than twice the US$88bn spent on desktop advertising, and just US$5bn behind the US$192bn spent on television advertising. At the current rate of growth, mobile advertising will comfortably overtake television in 2021.
 
As internet users switch from desktop to mobile devices – and new users go straight to mobile – online advertising is making the same switch. Advertising on mobile devices is rising at a meteoric rate and is taking market share from most other media. Mobile adspend grew 35% in 2017, and we expect it to grow at an average rate of 21% a year to 2020.​ https://www.zenithmedia.com/insights/global-intelligence-issue-06-2018/mobile-share-of-advertising-market-to-exceed-30-in-2020/​

Content Mining Plan
 Once our planned SaaS media applications, smart phones and tablets are launched into the domestic and international markets, content analytics or marketing data will be gathered from these devices. The data generated from these applications and devices will give us an advantage insight into our subscribers viewing and buying habits. Once data has been scrubbed of personally identifying information, we plan to be able to create original or lease content from broadcast partners to service what our analytics are telling us to produce (or license), with the intent on moving us closer towards predictive analytics. Predictive analytics is being able to predict what our customer likes based on their viewing habits and then produce that content targeted to our subscriber and then “push” that new (or licensed) content to them.
Our ViewMe Live Technology Plan
 
We offer VML technology for which we plan to expand marketing. We believe SaaS ViewMe Live (VML) could become a leading Digital Media Mobile TV technology platform in the business-to-business and business-to-

consumer markets. Our proprietary software platform can reach a worldwide audience of approximately one billion mobile viewers. VML addresses global mobile distribution of LIVE and Video on Demand (“VOD”) content as a white label Software as a Service (“SaaS”).


VML OTT live streaming technology is similar to what you see with satellite TV such as Dish Network and DirecTV, as well as cable companies. Almost all currently existing live streaming cannot do live broadcast streaming at this level and usually has anywhere from 1 minute to 10 minute delays or continuous buffering, never loading the video. With VML, there is the ability to have “worldwide” access for a live streaming event equal to standard television broadcasting with tens of millions of simultaneous users. We believe that VML is the first technology to be able to achieve this level of live streaming. In emerging countries that do not have fiber, cable and satellite TV, access to VML is simple and cost effective, as long as there is a cellular connection on a 3G network or higher (regardless of provider)[1]. VML aims to provide uninterrupted live streaming on mobile devices without buffering, crashes, pixilation, or audio and video syncing issues. One practical application of this technology is that a viewer can move from a Wi--Fi connection to a 3G connection without interruption. VML has a unique user interface with multi--channel access and built-in social media, and we believe it is unlike anything currently on the market. VML also has the capability to do a Live Linear Broadcast with VOD.VML’s technology has the potential to reduce web content pirating since high quality TV broadcast is now easily accessed worldwide on mobile devices.
 
Currently, we believe we are the only company that does all the above in the industry and we believe VML has the potential to expand our technologies and applications even further.
 
[1] Subject to the laws and regulations of each country.
 
The hottest technology in the over the top (“OTT”) market and the biggest challenge in the OTT market is “Live Linear Channel Broadcasting” and “Live Event Broadcasting” to equal standard television broadcasting on cable and satellite TV. This type of technology is superior to video on demand (VOD) streaming technology in both acquisition and delivery. The growth of OTT video delivery has been significant. In the past year alone, OTT has grown to $35 billion in global revenue, with $17 billion coming from emerging markets source Digital TV Research. ViewMe Live (“VML”) has many technology advantages including: Artificial Intelligence (“AI”); the ability to simultaneously access millions of users simultaneously with virtually no latency equivalent to standard television broadcasting; global distribution (without interruption) on cellular and Wi--Fi; and a fully interactive menu user interface and worldwide advertising brokers in place.
 
VML’s content delivery network (“CDN”) can potentially reach tens of millions of mobile devices (tablets and smartphones) and has the potential to scale to one billion video streams globally. It loads content within seconds, not only for Wi-Fi, but also more importantly, on cellular networks that are 3G and higher. VML’s core technology is fully developed and is able to support clients on a turnkey native mobile app in less than 60 days. We have already achieved major milestones as the world’s largest private conduit build out for global deployment of LIVE and VOD streaming content. Our OTT live streaming technology is unique and proprietary. Here are some highlights on how VML can help from telecommunication companies to TV station broadcasters to digital film libraries.
 
VML has the ability to create a “Master Network Mobile App” that can allow for a multiple channel build out, each with its own unique Pay Per View charge (optional). This means a company can have a live event channel per country with a different price per user based on the economics of that country. VML has unlimited channel build out (e.g. a company could have 50 channels or 1000 channels). Any telecommunications company can have professional looking displays and user interfaces for mobile with VML, similar to what the large telecommunications companies provide. A Master Network App also allows a network to expand into other categories by country (e.g. additional sports categories for various sports by country). Expansion can focus on audience aggregation for sports and other forms of entertainment categories. Pay-Per View is an option for these expanded categories as well. We have built-in worldwide ad brokers for pre---roll commercial ads so that revenue can be generated as soon as possible. There is also potential to upsell to existing advertisers and sponsors and it can be brand specific by country.
 
Our differentiation from webstreaming
 
We are not a website-based video streaming technology. VML is strictly a native mobile app focused on video streaming technology for mobile platforms. We are not a dashboard-based video content company where users

upload content; we are a complete turnkey SaaS application. A survey released in May 2015, sponsored by Level 3 Communications, stated, “Offering both VOD and Live Linear channels will be critical for OTT providers to entice new prospects and gain market share. This trend is a critical one. For existing OTT providers, offering a VOD service may not be enough to maintain, much less grow, market share.” The trend towards adding live linear channel content has the potential to become “table stakes” in the OTT game over the next several years, with both breaking news and live sports content leading the way in terms of interest for OTT service providers adding live linear channels.
 
SaaS White Label
 
We plan to white label our suite of SaaS technologies for yearly licensing and monthly maintenance fees. The prospective user base for the SaaS White Label Suite is extensive as there are more than 200,000 TV broadcasters worldwide alone, and many of them are seeking to migrate to the vast mobile video streaming market space. The sizeable population of potential SaaS clients includes standard television broadcasters in every country, direct marketing companies, low-powered antenna broadcasters (such as universities and churches), IPTV broadcasters, and large content (film and TV) providers that are seeking to further monetize their properties for worldwide syndication.
 
The SaaS suite includes full app development on Apple iOS, Google Android and Roku connected boxes, user interface (menu system), advertising broker network for pre---roll commercial ads (from date of launch), 24/7 LIVE monitoring of inbound and outbound signals, data analytics, seamless updating to all platforms, Amazon web service (AWS) blade servers, and coverage up to the first 20 million streams. The white label product is offered to stand--alone.
 
User Interface
 
In a preprogrammed live linear broadcast application, viewers have free access via a playlist by category and have the ability to “catch--up” with what they may have missed in the LIVE broadcast, regardless of its original airdate. The video-on-demand (VOD) feature provides the opportunity to access additional viewers and monetize past content. After several years in development, we believe that VML has a significant first to market advantage and that no other companies currently have a comparable commercialized offering.
 
VML has also been developed and customized for the mobile streaming technology of Viki, a Korean Pop TV content provider. Ten months post--launch, Viki reached 50 million installed apps for mobile devices and attracted 22 million users in approximately 200 countries. This rapid scalability was one factor in Viki’s acquisition by Rakuten for $200 million.

Our Plan for Strategic Partnering with Telecommunication & Media Companies
 
Currently in the world, viewers usually need to have a contract with a cable provider (e.g. AT&T, Cox, Xfinity, Spectrum, or Cablevision in the U.S.) or satellite TV provider (e.g. DirecTV and DISH Network in the U.S.) and be in range of a residential or business Wi-Fi to be able to watch over the top (OTT) content on a connected TV device, website or mobile access. VML is capable of offering a nearly unlimited number of channels to mobile users virtually anywhere and everywhere, with global reach, far exceeding two U.S. satellite companies (DirecTV and DISH Network), which have 500+ channels each and are only available in the U.S.
 
We believe VML will immediately appeal to any channel that is currently on DirecTV and DISH Network for global mobile linear broadcast participation, simply because these platforms are only available in the U.S. market.
 
VML can provide low--powered TV stations (after found in churches and universities), along with high--powered stations, the ability to reach the entire global market. Other potential users are owners of libraries of digitized content, and LIVE event venues such as music concerts, sporting events, festivals, beauty pageants, summer and winter Olympic Games, award shows, red carpet events, trade shows and conventions. Enthusiasts can produce their own show in any area and could launch their own channels for travel, food, spirits, sports, outdoor recreation, retro TV shows, children, cartoons, comedy, drama, reality, education, automobiles, health, corporations, shopping, soap opera, game shows, dating, religion, etc., providing extensive possibilities for media expansion. Content providers will not be limited by the major TV networks and film studios for distribution rights.

CYBER RISKS
 
Like other large telecommunications companies, we are a constant target of cyber-attacks of varying degrees, which has caused us to spend increasingly more time and money to deal with increasingly sophisticated attacks. Some of the attacks may result in security breaches, and we periodically notify our customers, our employees or the public of these breaches when necessary or appropriate. None of these resulting security breaches to date have materially adversely affected our business, results of operations or financial condition.
 
We rely on several other communications companies to provide services or products for our offerings. We may lease a significant portion of our core fiber network from our competitors and other third parties. Many of these leases will lapse in future years. Our future ability to provide services on the terms of our current offerings will depend in part upon our ability to renew or replace these leases, agreements and arrangements on terms substantially similar to those currently in effect.
 
For additional information regarding our systems, network, cyber risks, capital expenditure requirements and reliance upon third parties, see "Risk Factors."
 
COMPETITION, COMPETITORS, REGULATION AND TAXATION
 
Competition
 
General 
 
We compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market, and we expect intense competition to continue. In addition to competition from larger national telecommunications providers, we are facing increasing competition from several other sources, including cable and satellite companies, wireless providers, technology companies, cloud

27
--

companies, broadband providers, device providers, resellers, sales agents and facilities-based providers using their own networks as well as those leasing parts of our network. Technological advances and regulatory and legislative changes have increased opportunities for a wide range of alternative communications service providers, which in turn have increased competitive pressures on our business. These alternate providers often face fewer regulations and have lower cost structures than we do. In addition, the communications industry has, in recent years, experienced substantial consolidation, and some of our competitors in one or more lines of our business are generally larger, have stronger brand names, have more financial and business resources and have broader service offerings than we currently do.
 
Wireless telephone services are a significant source of competition with our legacy carrier services. It is increasingly common for customers to completely forego use of traditional wireline phone service and instead rely solely on wireless service for voice services. We anticipate this trend will continue, particularly as our older customers are replaced over time with younger customers who are less accustomed to using traditional wireline voice services. Technological and regulatory developments in wireless services, Wi-Fi, and other wired and wireless technologies have contributed to the development of alternatives to traditional landline voice services. Moreover, the growing prevalence of electronic mail, text messaging, social networking and similar digital non-voice communications services continues to reduce the demand for traditional landline voice services. These factors have led to a long-term systemic decline in the number of our wireline voice service customers.
 
The Telecommunications Act of 1996, which obligates carriers to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the carrier's network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition, imposes several duties on a carrier if it receives a specific request from another entity which seeks to connect with or provide services using the carrier's network. In addition, each carrier is obligated to (i) negotiate interconnection agreements in good faith, (ii) provide nondiscriminatory "unbundled" access to all aspects of the carrier's network, (iii) offer resale of its telecommunications services at wholesale rates and (iv) permit competitors, on terms and conditions (including rates) that are just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory, to colocate their physical plant on the carrier's property, or provide virtual colocation if physical colocation is not practicable. Current FCC rules require carriers to lease a network element only in those situations where competing carriers genuinely would be impaired without access to such network elements, and where the unbundling would not interfere with the development of facilities-based competition.
 
As a result of these regulatory, consumer and technological developments, carriers also face competition from competitive local exchange carriers, or CLECs, particularly in densely populated areas. CLECs provide competing services through reselling a carrier’s local services, through use of a carrier's unbundled network elements or through their own facilities.
 
Technological developments have led to the development of new products and services that have reduced the demand for our traditional services, as noted above, or that compete with traditional carrier services. Technological improvements have enabled cable television companies to provide traditional circuit-switched telephone service over their cable networks, and several national cable companies have aggressively marketed these services. Similarly, companies providing VoIP services provide voice communication services over the Internet which compete with our traditional telephone service and our own VoIP services. In addition, demand for our broadband services could be adversely affected by advanced wireless data transmission technologies being deployed by wireless providers and by certain technologies permitting cable companies and other competitors to deliver faster average broadband transmission speeds than ours.
 
Similar to us, many cable, technology or other communications companies that previously offered a limited range of services are now offering diversified bundles of services, either through their own networks, reselling arrangements or joint ventures. As such, a growing number of companies are competing to serve the communications needs of the
 same customer base. Such activities will continue to place downward pressure on the demand for and pricing of our services.
 
As customers increasingly demand high-speed connections for entertainment, communications and productivity, we expect the demands on our network will continue to increase over the next several years. To succeed, we must continue to invest in our networks or engage partners to ensure that they can deliver competitive services that meet
  
28

these increasing bandwidth and speed requirements. In addition, network reliability and security are increasingly important competitive factors in our business.
 
Additional information about competitive pressures is located under the heading “Risk Factors.”
 
Competitors
 
In connection with providing strategic services to our business customers, which includes our small, medium and enterprise business, wholesale and governmental customers, we compete against other telecommunication providers, as well as other regional and national carriers, other data transport providers, cable companies, CLECs and other enterprises, some of whom are substantially larger than us. Competition is based on price, bandwidth, quality and speed of service, promotions and bundled offerings. In providing broadband services, we compete primarily with cable companies, wireless providers, technology companies and other broadband service providers. We face competition in Ethernet based services in the wholesale market from cable companies and fiber-based providers.
 
Our competitors for providing integrated data, broadband, voice services and other data services to our business customers range from small to mid-sized businesses. Due to the size of some of these companies, our competitors may be able to offer more inexpensive solutions to our customers. To compete, we focus on providing sophisticated, secure and performance-driven services to our business customers through our infrastructure.
 
The number of companies providing business services has grown and increased competition for these services, particularly with respect to smaller business customers. Many of our competitors for strategic services are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as we are and therefore they are able to avoid significant regulatory costs and obligations.
  
Government Regulation
 
Overview
 
As discussed further below, our operations are subject to significant local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations.
 
We are subject to the significant regulations by the FCC, which regulates interstate communications, and state utility commissions, which regulate intrastate communications. These agencies (i) issue rules to protect consumers and promote competition, (ii) set the rates that telecommunication companies charge each other for exchanging traffic, and (iii) have traditionally developed and administered support programs designed to subsidize the provision of services to high-cost rural areas. In most states, local voice service, switched and special access services and interconnection services are subject to price regulation, although the extent of regulation varies by type of service and geographic region. In addition, we are required to maintain licenses with the FCC and with state utility commissions. Laws and regulations in many states restrict the manner in which a licensed entity can interact with affiliates, transfer assets, issue debt and engage in other business activities. Many acquisitions and divestitures may require approval by the FCC and some state commissions. These agencies typically have the authority to withhold their approval, or to request or impose substantial conditions upon the transacting parties in connection with granting their approvals.
 
The following description discusses some of the major industry regulations that may affect our traditional operations, but numerous other regulations not discussed below could also impact us. Some legislation and regulations are currently the subject of judicial, legislative and administrative proceedings which could substantially change the manner in which the telecommunications industry operates and the amount of revenues we receive for our services.
 
Neither the outcome of these proceedings, nor their potential impact on us, can be predicted at this time. For additional information, see "Risk Factors."
 

29
--

The laws and regulations governing our affairs are quite complex and occasionally in conflict with each other. From time to time, we are fined for failing to meet applicable regulations or service requirements.
 
Federal Regulation
 
General
 
We are required to comply with the Communications Act of 1934. Among other things, this law requires our local exchange carriers to offer various of our legacy services at just and reasonable rates and on non-discriminatory terms. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 materially amended the Communications Act of 1934, primarily to promote competition.
 
The FCC regulates interstate services we provide, including the special access charges we bill for wholesale network transmission and the interstate access charges that we bill to long-distance companies and other communications companies in connection with the origination and termination of interstate phone calls. Additionally, the FCC regulates a number of aspects of our business related to privacy, homeland security and network infrastructure, including our access to and use of local telephone numbers and our provision of emergency 911 services. The FCC has responsibility for maintaining and administering support programs designed to expand nationwide access to communications services (which are described further below), as well as other programs supporting service to low-income households, schools and libraries, and rural health care providers. Changes in the composition of the five members of the FCC or its Chairman can have significant impacts on the regulation of our business.
 
In recent years, our operations and those of other telecommunications carriers have been further impacted by legislation and regulation imposing additional obligations on us, particularly with regards to providing voice and broadband service, bolstering homeland security, increasing disaster recovery requirements, minimizing environmental impacts and enhancing privacy. These laws include the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, and laws governing local telephone number portability and customer proprietary network information requirements. In addition, the FCC has heightened its focus on the reliability of emergency 911 services. The FCC has imposed fines on us and other companies for 911 outages and has adopted new compliance requirements for providing 911 service. We are incurring capital and operating expenses designed to comply with the FCC's new requirements and minimize future outages. All of these laws and regulations may cause us to incur additional costs and could impact our ability to compete effectively against companies not subject to the same regulations.
 
Over the past several years, the FCC has taken various actions and initiated certain proceedings designed to comprehensively evaluate the proper regulation of the provisions of data services to businesses. As part of its evaluation, the FCC has reviewed the rates, terms and conditions under which these services are provided. The FCC's proceedings remain pending, and their ultimate impact on us is currently unknown.
 
Telephony Services
 
We operate traditional telecommunications services in our Arizona subsidiary, and those services are largely governed under rules established for CLECs under the Communications Act. The Communications Act entitles our CLEC subsidiary to certain rights, but as telecommunications carriers, it also subjects them to regulation by the FCC and the states. Their designation as telecommunications carriers also results in other regulations that may affect them and the services they offer.
Interconnection and Intercarrier Compensation 
 
The Communications Act requires telecommunications carriers to interconnect directly or indirectly with other telecommunications carriers. Under the FCC's intercarrier compensation rules, we are entitled, in some cases, to compensation from carriers when they use our network to terminate or originate calls and in other cases are required to compensate another carrier for using its network to originate or terminate traffic. The FCC and state regulatory commissions, including those in the states in which we operate, have adopted limits on the amounts of compensation that may be charged for certain types of traffic. As noted above, the FCC has determined that intercarrier compensation for all terminating traffic will be phased down over several years to a "bill-and-keep" regime, with no

30
--

compensation between carriers for most terminating traffic by 2018 and is considering further reform that could reduce or eliminate compensation for originating traffic as well.
 
Universal Service
 
Our CLEC subsidiary is required to contribute to the Universal Service Fund (“USF”). The amount of universal service contribution required of us is based on a percentage of revenues earned from interstate and international services provided to end users. We allocate our end user revenues and remit payments to the universal service fund in accordance with FCC rules. The FCC has ruled that states may impose state universal service fees on CLEC telecommunications services
State Regulation
 
Our CLEC subsidiary telecommunications services are subject to regulation by state commissions in each state where we provide services. In order to provide our services, we must seek approval from the state regulatory commission or be registered to provide services in each state where we operate and may at times require local approval to construct facilities. Regulatory obligations vary from state to state and include some or all of the following requirements: filing tariffs (rates, terms and conditions); filing operational, financial, and customer service reports; seeking approval to transfer the assets or capital stock of the broadband communications company; seeking approval to issue stocks, bonds and other forms of indebtedness of the broadband communications company; reporting customer service and quality of service requirements; outage reporting; making contributions to state universal service support programs; paying regulatory and state Telecommunications Relay Service and E911 fees; geographic build-out; and other matters relating to competition.
Other Regulations 
 
Our CLEC subsidiary telecommunications services are subject to other FCC requirements, including protecting the use and disclosure of customer proprietary network information; meeting certain notice requirements in the event of service termination; compliance with disabilities access requirements; compliance with CALEA standards; outage reporting; and the payment of fees to fund local number portability administration and the North American Numbering Plan. As noted above, the FCC and states are examining whether new requirements are necessary to improve the resiliency of communications networks. Communications with our customers are also subject to FCC, FTC and state regulations on telemarketing and the sending of unsolicited commercial e-mail and fax messages, as well as additional privacy and data security requirements.
Broadband
 
 Regulatory Classification.    Broadband Internet access services were traditionally classified by the FCC as "information services" for regulatory purposes, a type of service that is subject to a lesser degree of regulation than "telecommunications services." In 2015, the FCC reversed this determination and classified broadband Internet access services as "telecommunications services." This reclassification has subjected our broadband Internet access service to greater regulation, although the FCC did not apply all telecommunications service obligations to broadband Internet access service. The 2015 Order could have a material adverse impact on our business as it may justify additional FCC regulation or support efforts by States to justify additional regulation of broadband Internet access services. In December 2017, the FCC adopted an order that in large part reverses the 2015 Order and reestablishes the "information service" classification for broadband Internet access service. The 2017 Order has not yet gone into effect, however, and the 2015 Order will remain binding until the 2017 Order takes effect. The 2017 Order is expected to be subject to legal challenge that may delay its effect or overturn it.
 
Net Neutrality, and Current Status. The 2015 Order also established a new "Open Internet" framework that expanded disclosure requirements on Internet service providers ("ISPs") such as cable companies, prohibited blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization of Internet traffic on the basis of the content, and imposed a "general conduct standard" that prohibits unreasonable interference with the ability of end users and edge providers to reach each other. The FCC's 2017 Order eliminates these rules except for certain disclosure requirements (see the official release summary from the FCC below). Additionally, Congress and some states are considering legislation that may codify "network neutrality" rules.

The Federal Communications Commission has made the following official release about the Restoring Internet Freedom Order:
 
"The FCC's Restoring Internet Freedom Order, which took effect on June 11, (2018) provides a framework for protecting an open Internet while paving the way for better, faster and cheaper Internet access for consumers. It replaces unnecessary, heavy-handed regulations that were developed way back in 1934 with strong consumer protections, increased transparency, and common-sense rules that will promote investment and broadband deployment. The FCC's framework for protecting Internet freedom has three key parts:
 
1. Consumer Protection 
 The Federal Trade Commission will police and take action against Internet service providers for anticompetitive acts or unfair and deceptive practices. The FTC is the nation's premier consumer protection agency, and until the FCC stripped it of jurisdiction over Internet service providers in 2015, the FTC protected consumers consistently across the Internet economy.
2. Transparency
A critical part of Internet openness involves Internet service providers being transparent about their business practices. That's why the FCC has imposed enhanced transparency requirements. Internet service providers must publicly disclose information regarding their network management practices, performance, and commercial terms of service. These disclosures must be made via a publicly available, easily accessible company website or through the FCC's website. This will discourage harmful practices and help regulators target any problematic conduct. These disclosures also support innovation, investment, and competition by ensuring that entrepreneurs and other small businesses have the technical information necessary to create and maintain online content, applications, services, and devices.
 
Internet Service Providers must clearly disclose their network management practices on their own web sites or with the FCC. For more information about these disclosures, you can visit https://www.fcc.gov/isp- disclosures.
 
Removes Unnecessary Regulations to Promote Broadband Investment 
 The Internet wasn't broken in 2015, when the previous FCC imposed 1930s-era regulations (known as "Title II") on Internet service providers. And ironically, these regulations made things worse by limiting investment in high-speed networks and slowing broadband deployment. Under Title II, broadband network investment dropped more than 5.6% -- the first time a decline has happened outside of a recession. The effect was particularly serious for smaller Internet service providers (fixed wireless companies, small-town cable operators, municipal broadband providers, electric cooperatives, and others) that don't have the resources or lawyers to navigate a thicket of complex rules...."
 
The items listed in this internet Order are for carriers such as Century Link, which is our contract internet provider, and we are in compliance with the areas that we are responsible for which are few. We generate the last mile of internet service but we are actually a reseller of Century Link services as they provide the bandwidth to us.
 
        Access for Persons with Disabilities.    The FCC's rules require us to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to "advanced communications services" ("ACS"), such as electronic messaging and interoperable video conferencing. They also require that certain pay television programming delivered via Internet Protocol include closed captioning and require entities distributing such programming to end users to pass through such captions and identify programming that should be captioned.
 
        Other Regulation.    The 2015 Order also subjected broadband providers' Internet traffic exchange rates and practices to potential FCC oversight and created a mechanism for third parties to file complaints regarding these matters. In addition, our provision of Internet services also subjects us to the limitations on use and disclosure of user communications and records contained in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. Broadband Internet access service is also subject to other federal and state privacy laws applicable to electronic communications.
 

32
--

        Additionally, providers of broadband Internet access services must comply with CALEA, which requires providers to make their services and facilities accessible for law enforcement intercept requests. Various other federal and state laws apply to providers of services that are accessible through broadband Internet access service, including copyright laws, telemarketing laws, prohibitions on obscenity, and a ban on unsolicited commercial e-mail, and privacy and data security laws. Online content we provide is also subject to some of these laws.
 
        Other forms of regulation of broadband Internet access service currently being considered by the FCC, Congress or state legislatures include consumer protection requirements, cyber security requirements, consumer service standards, requirements to contribute to universal service programs and requirements to protect personally identifiable customer data from theft. Pending and future legislation in this area could adversely affect our operations as an Internet service provider and our relationship with our Internet customers.
 
        Additionally, from time to time the FCC and Congress have considered whether to subject broadband Internet access services to the federal Universal Service Fund ("USF") contribution requirements. Any contribution requirements adopted for Internet access services would impose significant new costs on our broadband Internet service. At the same time, the FCC is changing the manner in which Universal Service funds are distributed. By focusing on broadband and wireless deployment, rather than traditional telephone service, the changes could assist some of our competitors in more effectively competing with our service offerings.
 
VoIP Services
 
        We provide telephony services using VoIP technology ("interconnected VoIP"). The FCC has adopted several regulations for interconnected VoIP services, as have several states, especially as it relates to core customer and safety issues such as e911, local number portability, disability access, outage reporting, universal service contributions, and regulatory reporting requirements. The FCC has not, however, formally classified interconnected VoIP services as either information services or telecommunications services. In this vacuum, some states have asserted more expansive rights to regulate interconnected VoIP services, while others have adopted laws that bar the state commission from regulating VoIP service.
 
        Universal Service.    Interconnected VoIP services must contribute to the USF used to subsidize communication services provided to low income households, to customers in rural and high cost areas, and to schools, libraries, and rural health care providers. The amount of universal service contribution required of interconnected VoIP service providers is based on a percentage of revenues earned from interstate and international services provided to end users. We allocate our end user revenues and remit payments to the universal service fund in accordance with FCC rules. The FCC has ruled that states may impose state universal service fees on interconnected VoIP providers.
 
      Local Number Portability.    The FCC requires interconnected VoIP service providers and their "numbering partners" to ensure that their customers have the ability to port their telephone numbers when changing providers. We also contribute to federal funds to meet the shared costs of local number portability and the costs of North American Numbering Plan Administration.
 
        Intercarrier Compensation.    In an October 2011 reform order and subsequent clarifying orders, the FCC revised the regime governing payments among providers of telephony services for the exchange of calls between and among different networks ("intercarrier compensation") to, among other things, explicitly include interconnected VoIP. In that Order, the FCC determined that intercarrier compensation for all terminating traffic, including VoIP traffic exchanged in TDM format, will be phased down over several years to a "bill-and-keep" regime, with no compensation between carriers for most terminating traffic by 2018. The FCC is considering further reform in this area, which could reduce or eliminate compensation for originating traffic as well.
 
        Other Regulation.    Interconnected VoIP service providers are required to provide enhanced 911 emergency services to their customers; protect customer proprietary network information from unauthorized disclosure to third parties; report to the FCC on service outages; comply with telemarketing regulations and other privacy and data security requirements; comply with disabilities access requirements and service discontinuance obligations; comply with call signaling requirements; and comply with CALEA standards. In August 2015, the FCC adopted new rules to improve the resiliency of the communications network. Under the new rules, providers of telephony services,

including interconnected VoIP service providers, must make available eight hours of standby backup power for consumers to purchase at the point of sale. The rules also require that providers inform new and current customers about service limitations during power outages and steps that consumers can take to address those risks.

Based on our current cash reserves of approximately $50,000 as of March 31, 2019, we do not have the cash for an operational budget going forward.  If we are unable to generate enough revenue, to cover our operational costs, we will need to seek additional sources of funds.  Currently, we have no committed source for any funds as of date hereof. No representation is made that any funds will be available when needed.  In the event funds cannot be raised if and when needed, we may not be able to carry out our business plan and could fail in business as a result of these uncertainties.
