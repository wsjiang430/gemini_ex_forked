General
 
Republic First Bancorp, Inc. was organized and incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1987 and is the holding company for Republic First Bank, which does business under the name Republic Bank, and we may refer to as Republic or the Bank throughout this document.  Republic offers a variety of credit and depository banking services. Such services are offered to individuals and businesses primarily in the Greater Philadelphia and Southern New Jersey area through their offices and branches in Philadelphia, Bucks, Delaware, and Montgomery Counties in Pennsylvania and Atlantic,   Burlington, Camden, and Gloucester Counties in New Jersey.

 Historically, our primary objective had been to position ourselves as an alternative to the large financial institutions for commercial banking services in the Greater Philadelphia and Southern New Jersey region.  However, in 2008, we made an important and strategic shift in our business approach, redirecting our efforts toward the creation of a major retail bank that would meet an important need in our existing marketplace. Focused on delivering high levels of customer service and satisfaction, driving innovation, developing a bold brand and creating shareholder value, Republic Bank sought to offer a banking experience that would turn customers into Fans.  As other banks began to turn toward automation for growth, Republic Bank took a different approach and chose not only to embrace advances in technology, but to also define itself by the personal touch.
 

To achieve such a transformation, we recruited several key banking executives who had previously served in leadership roles at Commerce Bank, upon which this business model draws inspiration.  With a strong management team in place, along with adequate capital resources to support this revitalized vision, we began to build a unique brand with the goal of establishing ourselves as a premier financial institution in the Philadelphia metropolitan area.
     2
 
An important part of that strategic shift toward creating a retail and customer focused bank was the decision in 2010 to rebrand our stores from Republic First Bank to Republic Bank, which had been the name under which we had initially incorporated and operated from 1988-1996.  In support of that rebrand, we also renovated and remodeled the majority of our existing branches which refer to and operate as stores.  Further, we embraced critical service changes that reframed the Republic Bank brand and experience in the eyes of the consumer to include expanded hours, absolutely free checking, free coin counting, no ATM surcharges, mobile banking and much more.
 

From a lending perspective, we also shifted away from our historic approach, which was primarily focused on business banking and isolated commercial lending transactions, in particular commercial real estate loans.  While restructuring our loan portfolio and deemphasizing the origination of commercial real estate loans, we also undertook a detailed review of our more significant credit relationships.  This review allowed us to reduce exposure, enhance our allowance for loan loss methodology and commit to originate fewer commercial real estate loans in an effort to reduce our credit concentrations in that particular category.
 
In December 2011, we completed the sale of several distressed commercial real estate loans and foreclosed properties to a single investor.  This transaction dramatically reduced our non-performing asset balances and significantly improved our credit quality metrics. This loan sale was a cornerstone transaction in the transformation of Republic Bank.
 
With these significant changes implemented, Republic Bank was then well-positioned to execute an aggressive expansion plan which was given the title, “The Power of Red is Back.”  To support this growth strategy, we completed the sale of $45 million of common stock through a private placement offering in April 2014 which provided the necessary capital to begin our aggressive expansion plan.
 
During 2016, we expanded our product offerings through the addition of a residential mortgage lending team. We acquired Oak Mortgage Company in July 2016 which has been integrated and became a division of the Bank. Oak Mortgage is headquartered in Marlton, NJ and is licensed to do business in Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, and Florida providing our customers with new opportunities in the residential lending market. The Oak Mortgage team has been a tremendous fit for Republic’s commitment to extraordinary customer service and has proven to be a perfect complement to the Bank’s network of store locations.
 
To strengthen our capital position and prepare for the next stage of growth and expansion, we completed a capital raise in the amount of $100 million through a registered direct offering of our common stock in December 2016. At the same time, Vernon W. Hill, II became a member of the Board of Directors and was appointed Chairman of Republic First Bancorp, Inc. He has been a major investor and consultant to Republic since 2008. Mr. Hill is often credited with reinventing the concept of Retail Banking. He was the Founder and Chairman of Commerce Bancorp, a $50 billion Retail Bank headquartered in metro Philadelphia, which grew to 450 locations along the east coast before its sale in 2007. He is also the Founder and Chairman of Metro Bank (UK), which is the first new Retail high street bank opened in Britain since 1840 and in just eight years has grown to more than $28 billion in assets and 65 locations.
 
The aggressive expansion plan has produced strong results and continues to build momentum. Over the last five years, we have opened sixteen new stores using our signature glass building. During 2018, we expanded our store network in the Southern New Jersey area by opening three new locations in Gloucester Township, Evesboro, and Somers Point and expanded in the Greater Philadelphia area with a new store in Fairless Hills. There are several other locations in various stages of approval and development for future openings. We will also be expanding into the New York market with two to four new stores planned in Manhattan in the coming year.

As of December 31, 2018, we had total assets of approximately $2.8 billion, total shareholders’ equity of approximately $245.2 million, total deposits of approximately $2.4 billion, net loans receivable of approximately $1.4 billion, and net income of $8.6 million. We have one reportable segment: community banking. The community bank segment primarily encompasses the commercial loan and deposit activities of Republic, as well as residential mortgage and other consumer loan products in the area surrounding its stores. We provide banking services through the Bank, and do not presently engage in any activities other than traditional banking activities.
 
Republic Bank
 
Republic First Bank is a commercial bank chartered pursuant to the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. Republic First Bank does business under the name of Republic Bank. The deposits held by the Bank are insured, up to applicable limits, by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC.
Service Area / Market Overview
 
Our primary service area currently consists of Greater Philadelphia and Southern New Jersey.  We presently conduct our principal banking activities through twenty-five branch locations which are commonly referred to as “stores” throughout this document to reflect our retail oriented approach to customer service and convenience.  Eleven of these stores are located in Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs of Plymouth Meeting, Wynnewood, Abington, Media, and Fairless Hills in Pennsylvania.  There are also fourteen stores located in the Southern New Jersey market in Haddonfield, Voorhees, Glassboro, Marlton, Berlin, Washington Township, Moorestown, Sicklerville, Medford, Cherry Hill (2), Gloucester Township, Evesboro, and Somers Point. Our commercial lending activities extend beyond our primary service area, to include other counties in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, as well as parts of Delaware, Maryland, New York and other out-of-market opportunities. Our residential lending activities also extend outside of our primary service area, to include other counties in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, as well as Delaware and Florida through our Oak Mortgage lending team.
Competition
 
We face substantial competition from other financial institutions in our service area.  Competitors include Wells Fargo, BB&T, Citizens, PNC, Santander, TD Bank, and Bank of America, as well as many regional and local community banks. In addition, we compete directly with savings banks, savings and loan associations, finance companies, credit unions, mortgage brokers, insurance companies, securities brokerage firms, mutual funds, money market funds, private lenders and other institutions for deposits, commercial loans, mortgages and consumer loans, as well as other services.  Competition among financial institutions is based upon a number of factors, including the quality of services rendered, interest rates offered on deposit accounts, interest rates charged on loans and other credit services, service charges, the convenience of banking facilities, locations and hours of operation and, in the case of loans to larger commercial borrowers, applicable lending limits. Many of the financial institutions with which we compete have greater financial resources than we do, and offer a wider range of deposit and lending products.
 
Our legal lending limit to one borrower was approximately $34.4 million at December 31, 2018.  Loans above this amount may be made if the excess over the lending limit is participated to other institutions.  We are subject to potential intensified competition from new branches of established banks in the area as well as new banks that could open in our market area.  There are banks and other financial institutions, which serve surrounding areas, and additional out-of-state financial institutions, which currently, or in the future, may compete in our market. We compete to attract deposits and loan applications both from customers of existing institutions and from customers new to our market and we anticipate a continued increase in competition in our service area.
 
 4
 
We believe that an attractive niche exists serving small to medium sized business customers not adequately served by our larger competitors, and we will seek opportunities to build commercial relationships to complement our retail strategy.  We believe small to medium-sized businesses will continue to respond in a positive manner to the attentive and highly personalized service we provide.
 
Products and Services
 
We offer a range of competitively priced banking products and services, including consumer and commercial deposit accounts, checking accounts, interest-bearing demand accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, savings accounts, sweep accounts, lockbox services and individual retirement accounts and other traditional banking services, secured and unsecured commercial loans, real estate loans, construction and land development loans, automobile loans, home improvement loans, mortgages, home equity and overdraft lines of credit, and other products.  We attempt to offer a high level of personalized service to both our retail and commercial customers.
 
We also maintain a Small Business Lending team that specializes in the origination of loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) to provide much needed credit to small businesses throughout our service area.  This team has developed into one of the top lenders under the SBA program in our region.  For the last several years they have been ranked as one of the top SBA lenders in the tri-state market of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware based on the dollar volume of loan originations.
 
We are members of the STAR™ and PLUS™ automated teller (ATM) networks, and Allpoint - America’s Largest Surcharge Free ATM Network which enable us to provide our customers with free access to more than 55,000 ATMs worldwide. We currently have twenty-five proprietary ATMs located in our store network.
 
Our lending activities generally are focused on small and medium sized businesses within the communities that we serve. Commercial real estate loans represent the largest category within our loan portfolio, amounting to approximately 36% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2018.  Repayment of these loans is, in part, dependent on general economic conditions affecting our customers and various businesses within the community.  As a commercial lender, we are subject to credit risk. Economic and financial conditions could have an adverse effect on the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. To manage the challenges that the economic environment may present we have adopted a conservative loan classification system, continually review and enhance our allowance for loan loss methodology, and perform a comprehensive review of our loan portfolio on a regular basis.  
 
With the addition of Oak Mortgage Company in 2016, we are now able to offer residential mortgage loan products to customers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and Florida. A majority of the residential loans originated are currently sold on the secondary market shortly after closing. Oak Mortgage follows the established underwriting policies and guidelines of third party vendors with whom loans are being sold to maintain compliance, but credit risk still exists in the portfolio. Repayment of residential loans held in the portfolio is, in part, dependent on general economic conditions affecting our customers.  
 
Although management follows established underwriting policies and closely monitors loans through Republic’s loan review officer, credit risk is still inherent in the portfolio. The majority of Republic’s loan portfolio is collateralized with real estate or other collateral; however, a portion of the commercial portfolio is unsecured, representing loans made to borrowers considered to be of sufficient financial strength to merit unsecured financing.  Republic makes both fixed and variable rate commercial loans with terms typically ranging from one to five years. Variable rate loans are generally tied to the national prime rate of interest.

Store Expansion Plans and Growth Strategy
 
We will carefully evaluate growth opportunities throughout 2019 and beyond. The Bank opened three new stores located in Gloucester Township, Evesboro, and Somers Point in New Jersey and a fourth store located in Fairless Hills in Pennsylvania utilizing our distinctive glass prototype building in 2018. The Bank anticipates the continuation of its expansion strategy in the Metro Philadelphia market and has also announced plans to expand into New York City with the opening of two to four stores in 2019. Relocation of other existing store locations may also occur in the future as we continue to enhance our brand and focus on constantly improving the customer experience. The opening and relocation of these stores is subject to regulatory approval.
 
The addition of Oak Mortgage in July 2016 provides us with new growth opportunities in the residential lending market. Oak Mortgage is licensed to do business in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and Florida and gives us the ability to serve both new and existing customers throughout our store network. We envision the expansion of the Oak Mortgage lending team along with the growth of our store network.
 
Securities Portfolio

We maintain an investment securities portfolio.  We purchase investment securities that are in compliance with our investment policies, which are approved annually by our Board of Directors.  The investment policies address such issues as permissible investment categories, credit quality, maturities and concentrations.  At December 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately 92% and 90%, respectively, of the aggregate dollar amount of the investment securities consisted of either U.S. government debt securities or U.S. government agency issued mortgage-backed securities.  Credit risk associated with these U.S. government debt securities and the U.S. government agency securities is minimal, with risk-based capital weighting factors of 0% and 20%, respectively. The remainder of the securities portfolio consists of municipal securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) capital stock.
Supervision and Regulation
 
General
 
Republic, as a Pennsylvania state chartered bank, is not a member of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”) and is subject to supervision and regulation by the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. Our bank holding company is subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve under the Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”).  As a bank holding company, our activities and those of Republic are limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking, and we may not directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any company, including a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve.
 
We are subject to extensive requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that may be charged thereon, and limitations on the types of investments that may be made and the types of services that may be offered. Various federal and state consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of Republic. In addition to the impact of regulation, commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve attempting to control the money supply and credit availability in order to influence market interest rates and the national economy.

The following discussion summarizes certain banking laws and regulations that affect us and Republic.
 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”)  has had a broad impact on the financial services industry, including significant regulatory and compliance changes including, among other things, (i) enhanced resolution authority of troubled and failing banks and their holding companies; (ii) increased capital and liquidity requirements; (iii) increased regulatory examination fees; (iv) changes to assessments to be paid to the FDIC for federal deposit insurance; and (v) numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthening safety and soundness for, the financial services sector.  Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act established a new framework for systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC.  A summary of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act is set forth below.
 
•     Increased Capital Standards and Enhanced Supervision.  The federal banking agencies established minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies.  These new standards are summarized under “Capital Adequacy” below. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires capital requirements to be countercyclical such that the required amount of capital increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction consistent with safety and soundness.
 
•      The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).  The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB within the Federal Reserve. The CFPB is tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services.  The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers for a wide range of consumer protection laws applicable to banks with greater than $10 billion or more in assets.  Smaller institutions will be subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB, but will continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are more stringent than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB against state-chartered institutions.
 
•     Deposit Insurance.   The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000 for insured deposits.  Amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, which were mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, have revised the assessment base against which an insured depository institution’s deposit insurance premiums paid to the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) are calculated.  Under the amendments, the assessment base is no longer the institution’s deposit base, but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity during the assessment period.  Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act made changes to the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF, by increasing the minimum from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent of the estimated amount of total insured deposits by 2020 and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds.  The Dodd- Frank Act also provided that, effective July 21, 2011, depository institutions may pay interest on demand deposits.  For further discussion of deposit insurance regulatory matters, see “Deposit Insurance and Assessments” below.
 
•      Transactions with Affiliates.  Under federal law, we are subject to restrictions that limit certain types of transactions between Republic and its non-bank affiliates.  In general, we are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit, purchases of assets and certain other transactions involving us and our non-bank affiliates.  Transactions between Republic and its non-bank affiliates are required to be on arms length terms.  The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates under Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including expanding the definition of “covered transactions” and “affiliates,” as well as increasing the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained.
 
 7
 
•      Transactions with Insiders.  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, insider transaction limitations are expanded through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to the various limits, including derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions.  Restrictions have also been placed on certain asset sales to and from an insider to an institution, including requirements that such sales be on market terms and, if representing more than 10% of capital, approved by the institution’s board of directors.
 
•    Holding Company Capital Levels.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires bank regulators to establish minimum capital levels for holding companies that are at least as stringent as those applicable to depository institutions.  All trust preferred securities, or TRUPs, issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in assets are permanently grandfathered in Tier 1 capital, subject to a limitation of 25% of Tier 1 capital.
 
Although many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are currently effective, there remain some regulations yet to be implemented. It is therefore difficult to predict at this time what impact the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations will have on us. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements.
 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
 
The federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the “GLB Act”), enacted in 1999, repealed the key provisions of the Glass Steagall Act so as to permit commercial banks to affiliate with investment banks (securities firms). It also amended the BHC Act to permit qualifying bank holding companies to engage in many types of financial activities that were not permitted for banks themselves and permitted subsidiaries of banks to engage in a broad range of financial activities that were not permitted for themselves.
 
The result was to permit banking companies to offer a wider range of financial products and services to combine with other types of financial companies, such as securities and insurance companies. The impact of the GLB Act has, however, now been substantially limited by the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations issued by the Federal Reserve thereunder, specifically the so-called “Volcker Rule,” which will limit the ability of banks and their affiliates to invest in, or to engage in, non-banking activities for their own account.
    The GLB Act created a new type of bank holding company called a “financial holding company” (“FHC”).  An FHC is authorized to engage in any activity that is “financial in nature or incidental to financial activities” and any activity that the Federal Reserve determines is “complementary to financial activities” and does not pose undue risks to the financial system.  Among other things, “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and sales, and certain merchant banking activities.  A bank holding company qualifies to become an FHC if each of its depository institution subsidiaries is “well capitalized,” “well managed,” and has a rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) of “satisfactory” or better.  A qualifying bank holding company becomes an FHC by filing with the Federal Reserve an election to become an FHC.  We have not elected to become an FHC.  Bank holding companies that do not qualify or elect to become FHCs will be limited in their activities to those previously permitted by law and regulation.
 
 8
 
In addition, the GLB Act provided significant new protections for the privacy of customer information.  These provisions apply to any company the business of which is engaging in activities permitted for an FHC, even if it is not itself an FHC.  The GLB Act subjected a financial institution to four new requirements regarding non-public information about a customer.  The financial institution must: adopt and disclose a privacy policy; give customers the right to “opt out” of disclosures to non-affiliated parties; not disclose any information to third party marketers; and follow regulatory standards to protect the security and confidentiality of customer information.
 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) comprehensively revised the laws affecting corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation and corporate reporting for entities, such as us, with equity or debt securities registered under the Exchange Act. Among other things, Sarbanes-Oxley and its implementing regulations have established new membership requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee, imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors (including restrictions on the types of non-audit services our auditors may provide to us), imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders. The requirements are intended to allow shareholders to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and directors.
 
Regulatory Restrictions on Dividends
 
Dividend payments by Republic to the holding company are subject to the Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965 (“Banking Code”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”). Under the Banking Code, no dividends may be paid except from “accumulated net earnings” (generally, undivided profits). Under the FDIA, an insured bank may pay no dividends if the bank is in arrears in the payment of any insurance assessment due to the FDIC. Under the Banking Code, Republic would be limited to $48.5 million of dividends payable plus an additional amount equal to its net profit for 2019, up to the date of any such dividend declaration. However, dividends would be further limited in order to maintain capital ratios as discussed in “Capital Adequacy”.
 
Federal regulatory authorities have adopted standards for the maintenance of adequate levels of regulatory capital by banks. Adherence to such standards further limits the ability of Republic to pay dividends to us.
 
Dividend Policy
 
We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and have no plans to pay any cash dividends in 2019 or in the foreseeable future.  See Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of this Form 10-K for more information.
Deposit Insurance and Assessments
 
The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, of federally insured banks and savings institutions and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and savings industries. The deposits of Republic are insured up to applicable limits per insured depositor by the FDIC. As noted above, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the maximum deposit insurance amount has been permanently increased to $250,000.
     9
 
As an FDIC-insured bank, Republic is subject to FDIC insurance assessments.  The FDIC regulations assess insurance premiums for small insured depository institutions based on a risk-based assessment system.  Under this assessment system, the FDIC evaluates the risk of each financial institution based on regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors. The rules base assessments on an institution’s average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity, as opposed to total deposits.
 
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments.  Any future increase in insurance premiums may adversely affect our results of operations.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the FDIC to take such steps as are necessary to increase the reserve ratio of the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits by 2020. The reserve ratio is the DIF balance divided by estimated insured deposits.   The reserve ratio reached 1.36% on September 30, 2018.  Because the reserve ratio has reached 1.35%, two deposit insurance assessment changes occurred under FDIC regulations:  (1) surcharges on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more (large institutions) will cease; and (2) banks with assets of less than $10 billion, such as us, will receive assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from between 1.15% and 1.35%, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at or above 1.38%, with credits starting with the March 31, 2019 assessment invoiced in June 2019.
 
In addition to paying basic deposit insurance assessments, the FDIC collects Financing Corporation (“FICO”) assessments to pay interest on FICO bonds.  FICO bonds were issued in the late 1980’s to recapitalize the (former) Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation.  The last of the remaining FICO bonds will mature in September 2019.  It is projected that the last FICO assessment will be collected on March 29, 2019. 
 
Capital Adequacy
 
The Federal Reserve has issued risk-based and leverage capital rules applicable to U.S. banking organizations such as the Company and Republic.  These guidelines are intended to reflect the relationship between the banking organization’s capital and the degree of risk associated with its operations based on transactions recorded on-balance sheet as well as off-balance sheet items.  The Federal Reserve may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels discussed below, due to the banking organization’s financial condition or actual or anticipated growth.
 
The capital adequacy rules define qualifying capital instruments and specify minimum amounts of capital as a percentage of assets that banking organizations are required to maintain.  Common equity Tier 1 capital generally includes common stock and related surplus, retained earnings and, in certain cases and subject to certain limitations, minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, other non-qualifying intangible assets and certain other deductions.  Tier 1 capital for banks and bank holding companies generally consists of the sum of common equity Tier 1 elements, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and related surplus in certain cases and subject to limitations, minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries that do not qualify as common equity Tier 1 capital, less certain deductions.  Tier 2 capital generally consists of hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt securities, cumulative perpetual preferred stock, term subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock, and, subject to limitations, allowances for loan losses.  The sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital less certain required deductions represents qualifying total risk-based capital.  Prior to the effectiveness of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies were permitted to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock in Tier 1 capital, subject to limitations.  However, the Federal Reserve’s capital rule applicable to bank holding companies permanently grandfathers non-qualifying capital instruments, including trust preferred securities, issued before May 19, 2010 by depository institution holding companies with less than $15 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009, subject to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital.  In addition, under rules that became effective January 1, 2015, accumulated other comprehensive income (positive or negative) must be reflected in Tier 1 capital; however, we were permitted to make a one-time, permanent election to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from capital. We have made this election.

Under the capital rules, risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing common equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and total risk-based capital, respectively, by risk-weighted assets.  Assets and off-balance sheet credit equivalents are assigned to one of several categories of risk-weights, based primarily on relative risk.  Under the Federal Reserve’s rules, Republic is required to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement of 6%, a minimum total capital requirement of 8% and a minimum leverage ratio requirement of 4%.  Under the new rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer comprised of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in an amount greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets.  The capital conservation buffer, which is composed of common equity tier 1 capital, began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and has been phased in over a three year period (increasing by that amount on each January 1, until it reached 2.5% on January 1, 2019).  Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital began on January 1, 2015 and has been phased-in over a three-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015, 60% on January 1, 2016 and an additional 20% per year thereafter).
 
The following table shows the required capital ratios with the conversation buffer over the phase-in period.

Republic is considered “well capitalized” under the FDIC’s prompt corrective action rules. The risk-based capital standards are required to take adequate account of interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk and the risks of non-traditional activities.

Legislative and Regulatory Changes
 
We are heavily regulated by regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels. We, like most of our competitors, have faced and expect to continue to face increased regulation and regulatory and political scrutiny, which creates significant uncertainty for us as well as the financial services industry in general.
Future Legislative and Regulatory Developments
 
It is conceivable that compliance with current or future legislative and regulatory initiatives could require us to change certain business practices, impose significant additional costs on us, limit the products that we offer, result in a significant loss of revenue, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, require us to increase our regulatory capital, cause business disruptions, impact the value of assets that we hold or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. The extent of changes imposed by any future regulatory initiatives could make it more difficult for us to comply in a timely manner, which could further limit our operations, increase compliance costs or divert management attention or other resources. The long-term impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives on our business practices and revenues will depend upon the successful implementation of our strategies, consumer behavior, and competitors’ responses to such initiatives, all of which are difficult to predict.  Additionally, we may pursue, through appropriate avenues, legislative and regulatory advocacy to provide our input on possible legislative and regulatory developments.

The Trump Administration has indicated its intent to bring changes to the U.S. financial services industry that we cannot now predict. Public comments by President Donald J. Trump, as well as his appointees at various federal agencies, may suggest the Administration’s intent to change policies and regulations that implement current federal law, including those implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. At this point we are unable to determine what impact the Trump Administration’s policy changes might have on us.
 
Profitability, Monetary Policy and Economic Conditions
 
In addition to being affected by general economic conditions, the earnings and growth of Republic will be affected by the policies of regulatory authorities, including the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve.  An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the supply of money and other credit conditions in order to manage interest rates.  The monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.  The effects of such policies upon the future business, earnings and growth of Republic cannot be determined.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 531 employees, including 473 full-time employees.
