Item 1. Business
Overview
ATI Physical Therapy, Inc. and its subsidiaries (herein referred to as "we," "us," "our," "the Company" or "ATI") is a nationally recognized outpatient physical therapy provider in the United States specializing in outpatient rehabilitation and adjacent healthcare services, with 923 clinics (as well as 20 clinics under management service agreements) located in 25 states as of December 31, 2022. We operate with a commitment to providing our patients, medical provider partners, payors and employers with evidence-based, patient-centric care.
We offer a variety of services within our clinics, including physical therapy to treat spine, shoulder, knee and neck injuries or pain; work injury rehabilitation services, including work conditioning and work hardening; hand therapy; and other specialized treatment services. Our Company's team of professionals is dedicated to helping return patients to optimal physical health.
Physical therapy patients receive team-based care, standardized techniques and individualized treatment plans in an encouraging environment. To achieve optimal results, we use an extensive array of techniques including therapeutic exercise, manual therapy and strength training, among others. Our physical therapy model aims to deliver optimized outcomes and time to recovery for patients, insights and service satisfaction for referring providers and predictable costs and measurable value for payors.
In addition to providing services to physical therapy patients at outpatient rehabilitation clinics, we provide services through our ATI Worksite Solutions ("AWS") program, Management Service Agreements ("MSA"), and Sports Medicine arrangements. AWS provides an on-site team of healthcare professionals at employer worksites to promote work-related injury prevention, facilitate expedient and appropriate return-to-work follow-up and maintain the health and well-being of the workforce. Our MSA arrangements typically include the Company providing management and physical therapy-related services to physician-owned physical therapy clinics. Sports Medicine arrangements provide certified healthcare professionals to various schools, universities and other institutions to perform on-site physical therapy and rehabilitation services.
Our mission is to exceed the expectations of the hundreds of thousands of patients we serve each year by providing high quality of care in a friendly and encouraging environment. 
Our strategy includes:
•Exceeding customer expectations and providing the right care at the right place at the right time;
•Building new and strengthening existing relationships with referral sources, payors and employees; and
•Allocating available capital to support initiatives and business plans.

The Company’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol “ATIP.”
This description of our business should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Transaction Support Agreement
On March 15, 2023, the Company entered into a Transaction Support Agreement (the “TSA”) with certain of its first lien lenders under the 2022 Credit Agreement (the "First Lien Lenders"), the administrative agent under the 2022 Credit Agreement, holders of its Series A Senior Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Equityholders") and holders of the majority of its common stock (together with the First Lien Lenders and the Preferred Equityholders, the “Parties”), setting forth the principal terms of a comprehensive transaction to enhance the Company's liquidity (the "Transaction"). Pursuant to the TSA, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Parties have agreed to support, act in good faith and take all steps reasonably necessary and desirable to consummate the transactions referenced therein by June 15, 2023 (the “Outside Closing Date”).
The TSA contemplates, among other things, (i) a delayed draw new money financing, available under certain circumstances until the 18 month anniversary of the closing date of the transactions, in an aggregate principal amount equal to $25.0 million in the form of new second lien PIK exchangeable notes (“Second Lien PIK Exchangeable Notes”), (ii) exchange of $100.0 million of the aggregate principal amount of the term loans under the 2022 Credit Facility held by certain of the Preferred Equityholders for Second Lien PIK Exchangeable Notes, (iii) a reduction of the thresholds applicable to the minimum liquidity financial covenant under the 2022 Credit Agreement for certain periods, (iv) a waiver of the requirement to comply with the Secured Net Leverage Ratio financial covenant under the 2022 Credit Agreement for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2024, September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2024 and a modification of the levels and certain component definitions applicable thereto in the fiscal quarters ending after December 31, 2024, (v) waiver of the requirement for the Company to deliver audited financial statements without certain going concern qualifications for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2024, (vi) an increase in the interest rate payable on the existing term loans and revolving loans until the achievement of a specified financial metric and (vii) board representation and observer rights, and other changes to the governance of the Company. The Second Lien PIK Exchangeable Notes would be exchangeable for shares of Class A common stock of the Company at a fixed price of $0.25, and the holders thereof would have the right to vote on corporate matters on an as-exchanged basis. The TSA contains certain representations, warranties and other agreements by the Company and Parties. In accordance with the TSA, the First Lien Lenders agreed that, prior to the Outside Closing Date, they will forbear in the exercise of any rights, remedies, powers, privileges and defenses under the 2022 Credit Agreement arising on account of an alleged default or event of default (if any) resulting from the going concern explanatory paragraph in the independent auditors' report accompanying the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the "Credit Agreement Forbearance"). The Parties' obligations under the TSA are, and the closing of the Transaction is, subject to various customary terms and conditions set forth therein, including the execution and delivery of definitive documentation and approval by the Company's stockholders.
There is no assurance that the transactions contemplated by the TSA will be consummated on the terms as described above, on a timely basis or at all.
Our Operating Model
We operate under a single "ATI" brand and own the operations of nearly all of our clinics, which we believe enables us to more consistently align the clinical and patient experience, align incentives across our teams, track and analyze clinical outcome data, and promote efficiency in our operations. The key components of our operating model include:
•Patients. We are highly focused on providing the best possible patient experience. In our clinics, we strive to maintain a consistently positive look, feel and experience. Additionally, we aim to deliver functional outcomes that meet or exceed national physical therapy industry outcomes across all body regions, which enables patients to return to their normal activities. We are proud of our average Net Promoter Score (“NPS”) of 75 and our average Google Review rating of 4.9 stars across our clinics over the trailing four quarters as of December 31, 2022. We believe these metrics are indicative of our patients’ overall satisfaction with our services and the ATI brand.
•Medical Provider Partners. We believe our medical provider partners also benefit from our customer-driven culture, expansive patient outcomes database, and case management approach, which facilitate end-to-end patient care with musculoskeletal ("MSK") issues. Our proprietary electronic medical records ("EMR") system includes a variety of custom tools and analytics to evaluate patient performance, providing medical partner providers with simple, intuitive reports on shared patients regarding functional outcomes and performance. These scorecards are used to drive continuous quality improvement and deliver more predictable results.
•Payors. We derive revenue from a diverse range of payor sources, including commercial health plans, government programs (i.e., Medicare and Medicaid), workers’ compensation insurance and auto/personal injury insurance. We believe we offer value to payors not only through quality outcomes that may reduce downstream costs, but also through our national footprint, convenient locations and high customer ratings, which help ensure patients are satisfied with their plan offerings and benefits.
Our Platform
Key elements of our platform include:
•Our People. Our business strategy relies on attracting, training, developing and retaining a skilled workforce. We experienced elevated levels of attrition during periods of 2021 and 2022 and have taken actions in an effort to improve hiring and attrition levels. While we observed improvement in hiring and attrition levels since implementing these actions in 2021, attrition remained above historical levels during periods of 2022 due to a continued tight labor market for available physical therapy and other healthcare providers in the workforce. We operate on a team-based approach that works to match physical therapists, physical therapy assistants and operational support specialists with patients based on acuity to ensure patients can be seen in a timely fashion and in compliance with healthcare laws and regulations and licensure requirements. Our employees' success is measured primarily by patient outcomes and customer satisfaction. We have invested in clinical and leadership development programs offering our clinical and support staff opportunities to enhance their clinical skills and take on increasing leadership responsibilities. Combined with a competitive compensation model, we strive to be an attractive employer in the physical therapy industry.
•Our Clinical Systems & Data. Our proprietary, internally developed EMR platform supports our clinical workflows and leverages our database of more than two and half million unique patient cases as well as peer-reviewed best practices guidelines and care protocols to maximize outcomes for our patients. Our EMR is purpose-built for physical therapy and has diagnosis-specific guidelines in place covering the majority of our patient cases. Our clinical systems and data enhance our ability to effectively manage, deliver and track patient outcomes.
•Our Technology-Enabled Infrastructure. We strive to incorporate data and analytics into the ongoing management of our operations, including monitoring operating performance metrics at various levels. We continually evaluate our technology and tools to determine how best our tools can support the business.
Our Services
Physical Therapy
We offer a variety of services within our clinics, including physical therapy to treat spine, shoulder, knee and neck injuries or pain; work injury rehabilitation services, including work conditioning and work hardening; hand therapy; and other specialized treatment services.
To supplement our traditional outpatient physical therapy services, we introduced a tele-physical therapy offering in early 2020, amidst state lockdowns nationwide in response to COVID-19 (as defined below). We believe that, while virtual visits will not fully replace the need for in-person treatment, our tele-physical therapy offering serves as a convenient option for patients who either lack immediate access to a clinic or are looking to supplement traditional treatments. This offering also allows us to serve patients in locations where we do not have a physical presence today.
ATI Worksite Solutions ("AWS")
AWS is an on-site service that provides customized cost-saving injury prevention programs, work-related injury assessment services, wellness offerings and consultations for employers, ranging from Fortune 100 companies to small local businesses. We staff athletic trainers, physical therapy assistants and other clinicians as Early Intervention Specialists at the employer's site to provide early interventions and promote physical health and wellness.
Management Service Agreements ("MSA")
We partner with physician-owned practices to improve their performance, drive efficiencies and optimize patient outcomes. Utilizing our resources and infrastructure, we provide dedicated service teams to oversee the integration of our programs into physical therapy practices. This includes proprietary EMR integration, caseload management and continuing education in therapy treatments.
Sports Medicine
Our Sports Medicine athletic trainers work with athletes at all levels of competition to prevent, evaluate and treat sports injuries. We offer on-site sports physical therapy services, clinical evaluation and diagnosis, immediate and emergency care, nutrition programs and concussion management, among others.
Industry Factors and Competition
MSK conditions affect individuals of all ages and represent some of the most common causes of health problems in the United States. Physical therapy and related services are low-cost solutions that can address a variety of MSK conditions. We believe that the following factors, among others, affect the market and industry trends for outpatient physical therapy services:
•Outpatient physical therapy services growth. Outpatient physical therapy continues to play a key role in treating musculoskeletal conditions for patients. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS"), musculoskeletal conditions impact individuals of all ages and include some of the most common health issues in the U.S. As healthcare trends in the U.S. continue to evolve, with a growing focus on value-based care emphasizing up-front, conservative care to deliver better outcomes, quality healthcare services addressing such conditions in lower cost outpatient settings may continue increasing in prevalence.
•U.S. population demographics. The population of adults aged 65 and older in the U.S. is expected to continue to grow and thus expand the Company's market opportunity. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of adults over the age of 65 is expected to grow 30% from 2020 through 2030.
•Federal funding for Medicare and Medicaid. Federal and state funding of Medicare and Medicaid and the terms of access to these reimbursement programs affect demand for physical therapy services. In recent years, through legislative and regulatory actions, the federal government has made substantial changes to various payment systems under the Medicare program. Beginning in January 2022, the physical therapy industry observed a reduction of Medicare reimbursement rates of approximately 0.75%, as well as a 15% decrease in payments for services performed by physical therapy assistants. Additionally, a further reduction through resuming sequestration was postponed. Sequestration reductions resumed at 1% after March 31, 2022, and by an additional 1% after June 30, 2022, which resulted in an overall reduction of 2% in reimbursement rates related to sequestration after June 30, 2022. In July 2022, the CMS released its proposed 2023 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, which called for an approximate 4.5% reduction in the calendar year 2023 conversion factor. In December 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act (2023) was signed into law. The Consolidated Appropriations Act (2023) provides partial relief related to Medicare cuts including 2.5% relief in 2023 and 1.25% relief in 2024. As a result, the reimbursement rate reduction beginning in January 2023 was approximately 2.0%.
•Workers' compensation funding. Payments received under certain workers' compensation arrangements may be based on predetermined state fee schedules, which may be impacted by changes in state funding.
•Number of people with private health insurance. Physical therapy services are often covered by private health insurance. Individuals covered by private health insurance may be more likely to use healthcare services because it helps offset the cost of such services. As health insurance coverage rises, demand for physical therapy services tends to also increase.
The outpatient physical therapy market is highly fragmented, rapidly evolving and highly competitive. Competition within the industry may intensify in the future as existing competitors and new entrants introduce new physical therapy services and platforms and consolidation in the healthcare industry continues. We currently face competition from the following categories of principal competitors: 
•National physical therapy providers;
•Regional physical therapy providers;
•Physician-owned physical therapy providers;
•Individual practitioners or local physical therapy operators, which number in the thousands across the nation; and
•Vertically integrated hospital systems and scaled physician practices.
We believe the principal competitive factors in the outpatient physical therapy market include the quality of care, cost of care, treatment outcomes, breadth of location and geographic convenience, breadth of patient insurance coverage accepted by clinics, brand awareness and relations with referral sources and key industry participants. We compete in our existing markets by leveraging our unified brand, advertising to increase patient awareness, utilizing sales efforts to establish new and enhance existing relationships with referral sources, applying our team-based approach to care, leveraging our proprietary EMR and data-driven operating platform and striving for high quality of care expectations. Beginning in 2019, physical therapy providers were included in the CMS Quality Payment Program and were eligible to report quality metrics for the Merit-based Incentive Payment System ("MIPS"). We opted to report 2019 performance as an early adopter, and we received an 'exceptional' rating based on the data submitted across our platform and received a quality 'bonus' on 2021 billed CMS payments. Beginning in 2020, the CMS MIPS measures reporting became mandatory for all physical therapy providers. In November 2021, the 2020 scores were finalized and based on our performance we again received an 'exceptional' rating while scoring in the 99th percentile across all clinics and accordingly received the highest possible quality 'bonus' with respect to 2022 billed CMS payments. Furthermore, in August 2022 the 2021 scores were finalized and based on our performance we received an 'exceptional' rating while scoring in the 99th percentile across all clinics. As such, we expect to receive the highest possible quality 'bonus' with respect to 2023 billed CMS payments. We believe the 'exceptional' rating by CMS reflects our commitment to delivering a high quality of care. Additionally, in January 2022 we achieved Credentialing Accreditation status by the National Committee for Quality Assurance ("NCQA"). As an accredited organization, we have demonstrated that our credentialing processes are in accordance with the highest quality standards.
Clinic Fleet
ATI is a nationally recognized outpatient physical therapy provider in the United States specializing in outpatient rehabilitation and adjacent healthcare services, with 923 clinics (as well as 20 clinics under management service agreements) located in 25 states as of December 31, 2022. We opened 110 standalone de novo and acqui-novo clinics over the three years ended December 31, 2022. We have built proprietary methods to identify future sites in urban and suburban, high-traffic areas. By incorporating various datasets, including CMS and census data, we are able to compile a comprehensive assessment of potential new locations. Through our proprietary site-selection tools, we believe there continues to be significant whitespace opportunity within our existing states, with further opportunity available beyond our existing states. However, our capital expenditure, acquisition, de novo and acqui-novo spend depends on many factors, including, but not limited to, the targeted number of new clinic openings, patient volumes, clinician labor market, revenue growth rates and level of operating cash flows. As a result of negative operating cash flows, net losses and liquidity constraints, the number of new clinic openings has decreased in recent years relative to historical years and may continue at lower than historical levels. As a result of these and other factors, we also closed 23 clinics in both 2022 and 2021, and we may continue to right size our clinic fleet through clinic closures and divestitures.
Our Employees and Human Capital Resources
Our business strategy relies on attracting, training, developing, and retaining a skilled workforce. Our clinicians are a driving force for favorable patient outcomes and are key to our success. The Company has aimed to increase its clinical staffing levels by hiring clinicians and reducing levels of clinician attrition that were elevated in recent periods, which was caused, in part, by changes made during the COVID-19 pandemic related to compensation, staffing levels and support for clinicians. We have implemented a range of actions related to compensation, staffing levels, clinical and professional development and other initiatives in an effort to retain and attract therapists across our platform. While we observed improvements in hiring and attrition levels since implementing these actions in 2021, attrition remained above historical levels during periods of 2022 due to a continued tight labor market for available physical therapy and other healthcare providers in the workforce.
We offer comprehensive Total Rewards in an effort to attract new candidates and retain existing employees. Our Total Rewards program includes, but is not limited to, incentive compensation plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, a 401(k) plan, paid time off and other work-life and wellness benefits. We have focused on adding greater efficiency and effectiveness around accountability and decision rights, acted swiftly and decisively in the advent of COVID-19 to continue our strong commitment to workplace safety and the health and welfare of our clinicians and patients and created leadership and development programs to support clinician career development and growth. 
We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to maintaining a diverse and inclusive work environment. Employees are treated with dignity and respect in an environment free from harassment and discrimination regardless of race, color, age, gender, disability, minority, sexual orientation or any other protected class. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion enables employees to realize their full potential and drives high performance through innovation and collaboration.
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 5,700 employees. This number is not inclusive of any contractors or temporary staff but does include our on-call clinicians. We do not have any employees who are represented by a labor union or are party to a collective bargaining agreement.
Impact of COVID-19
COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the outpatient physical therapy industry. In March 2020, as the pandemic began to affect all aspects of daily life, hospitals and surgical centers began to postpone elective and non-essential surgeries, reducing the volume of individuals requiring physical therapy services. Additionally, closures of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders, and social-distancing guidelines all adversely impacted the flow of visits to clinics.
We kept the vast majority of our clinics open during this period to ensure that we continued to provide the convenience and services that our patients need. As a substitute to in-person visits, we also quickly introduced our tele-physical therapy offering to improve access for our patients that require physical therapy but were not comfortable with in-person sessions. In response to the suppressed volumes, we quickly down-sized our workforce to better match clinicians to demand at the local level. At the same time, we took significant measures to make sure our employees were cared for, including maintaining health benefits for furloughed workers and reducing executive compensation to establish an employee relief pool that provided assistance to our employees most in need.
Governmental Regulations and Supervision
We are subject to extensive federal, state and local government laws and regulations, including Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules and regulations, anti-kickback laws, self-referral prohibition statutes, false claims statutes, exclusions statutes, civil monetary penalty statutes and associated regulations, among others. We are also subject to federal and state laws that regulate the reimbursement of our services and that are designed to prevent fraud and abuse, and impose state licensure and corporate practice of medicine restrictions, as well as federal and state laws and regulations relating to the privacy of individually identifiable information. We maintain a robust compliance program, have made significant investments around our controls across the organization, and we periodically conduct compliance audits and reviews along with compliance training designed to keep our officers, directors and employees educated and up-to-date and to emphasize our policy of strict compliance.
Reimbursement; Fraud and Abuse
We are subject to laws regulating reimbursement under various federal and state healthcare programs. The marketing, billing, documenting and other practices of healthcare companies are all subject to government scrutiny. To ensure compliance with Medicare, Medicaid and other regulations, health insurance carriers and state agencies often conduct audits and request customer records and other documents to support our claims submitted for payment of services rendered to customers. Similarly, government agencies and their contractors periodically open investigations and obtain information from us and from healthcare providers pursuant to the legal process. Violations of federal and state regulations can result in severe criminal, civil and administrative penalties and sanctions, including disqualification from Medicare and other reimbursement programs, which could significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations.
Various federal and state laws prohibit the submission of false or fraudulent claims, including claims to obtain payment under Medicare, Medicaid, and other government healthcare programs. These laws include the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits persons or entities from knowingly submitting or causing to be submitted a claim that the person knew or should have known (i) to be false or fraudulent; (ii) for items or services not provided or provided as claimed; or (iii) was provided by an individual not otherwise qualified or who was excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs. The False Claims Act also imposes penalties for requests for payment that otherwise violate conditions of participation in federal healthcare programs or other healthcare compliance laws. In recent years, federal and state government agencies have increased the level of enforcement resources and activities targeted at the healthcare industry. Additionally, the False Claims Act and similar state statutes allow individuals to bring lawsuits on behalf of the government, in what are known as qui tam or “whistleblower” actions, and can result in civil and criminal fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs. The use of these private enforcement actions against healthcare providers has increased dramatically in recent years, in part because the individual filing the initial complaint is entitled to share in a portion of any settlement or judgment. Revisions to the False Claims Act enacted in 2009 expanded significantly the scope of liability, provided for new investigative tools, and made it easier for whistleblowers to bring and maintain False Claims Act suits on behalf of the government.
Anti-Kickback Regulations
We are subject to federal and state laws regulating financial relationships involving federally-reimbursable healthcare services. These laws include Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the “Anti-Kickback Law”), under which civil and criminal penalties can be imposed upon persons who, among other things, offer, solicit, pay or receive remuneration in return for (i) the referral of patients for the rendering of any item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program (including Medicare and Medicaid); or (ii) purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing, ordering any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program (including Medicare and Medicaid). We believe that our business procedures and business arrangements are in compliance with these laws and regulations. However, the provisions are broadly written and the full extent of their specific application to specific facts and arrangements to which we are a party is uncertain and difficult to predict. In addition, several states have enacted state laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Law, many of which are more restrictive than the federal Anti-Kickback Law.
The Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) of the Health and Human Services Department has issued regulations describing compensation arrangements that fall within a “Safe Harbor” and, therefore, are not viewed as illegal remuneration under the Anti-Kickback Law. Failure to fall within a Safe Harbor does not mean that the Anti-Kickback Law has been violated; however, the OIG has indicated that failure to fall within a Safe Harbor may subject an arrangement to increased scrutiny under a “facts and circumstances” test. Federal case law provides limited guidance as to the application of the Anti-Kickback Law to these arrangements. However, we believe our arrangements, including our compensation and financial arrangements, comply with the Anti-Kickback Law. If our arrangements are found to violate the Anti-Kickback Law, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Penalties for violations include denial of payment for the services, significant criminal and civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, claims resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Law are considered false for purposes of the False Claims Act.
Physician Self-Referral
Provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. § 1395nn) (the “Stark Law”) prohibit referrals by a physician of “designated health services” which are payable, in whole or in part, by Medicare or Medicaid, to an entity in which the physician or the physician’s immediate family member has an investment interest or other financial relationship, subject to several exceptions. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute and proof of intent to violate the Stark Law is not required. Physical therapy services are among the “designated health services” subject to the Stark Law. Further, the Stark Law has application to our management contracts with individual physicians and physician groups, as well as, any other financial relationship between us and referring physicians, including medical advisor arrangements and any financial transaction resulting from a clinic acquisition. The Stark Law also prohibits billing for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral. Several states have enacted laws similar to the Stark Law. These state laws may cover all (not just Medicare and Medicaid) patients. As with the Anti-Kickback Law, we consider the Stark Law in planning our clinics, establishing contractual and other arrangements with physicians, marketing and other activities, and believe that our operations are in compliance with the Stark Law. If we violate the Stark Law or any similar state laws, our financial results and operations could be adversely affected. Penalties for violations include denial of payment for the services, significant civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
Corporate Practice; Fee-Splitting; Professional Licensure
The laws of some states restrict or prohibit the “corporate practice of medicine,” meaning business corporations cannot provide medical services through the direct employment of medical providers, or by exercising control over medical decisions by medical providers. In some states, the specific restrictions explicitly apply to physical therapy services, in others the specific restrictions have been interpreted to apply to physical therapy services or are not fully developed. The specific restrictions with respect to enforcement of the corporate practice of medicine or physical therapy vary from state to state and certain states in which we operate may present higher risk than others.
Many states also have laws that prohibit a non-physical therapy entity, individual, or provider fee-splitting. Generally, these laws restrict business arrangements that involve a physical therapist sharing professional fees with a referral source, but in some states, these laws have been interpreted to extend to management agreements between physical therapists and business entities under some circumstances.
We believe that each of our facilities and medical provider partners comply with any current corporate practice and fee-splitting laws of the state in which they are located. However, such laws and regulations vary from state to state and are enforced by governmental, judicial, law enforcement or regulatory authorities with broad discretion. We cannot be certain that our interpretation of certain laws and regulations is correct with respect to how we have structured our operations, service agreements and other arrangements with physical therapists in the states in which we operate. Future interpretations of corporate practice and fee-splitting laws, the enactment of new legislation, or the adoption of new regulations relating to these laws could cause us to have to restructure our business operations or close our facilities in a particular state.
Health Information Practices
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") required the Health and Human Services Department to adopt standards to protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable health-related information. HIPAA created a source of funding for fraud control to coordinate federal, state and local healthcare law enforcement programs, conduct investigations, provide guidance to the healthcare industry concerning fraudulent healthcare practices, and establish a national data bank to receive and report final adverse actions. HIPAA also criminalized certain forms of health fraud against all public and private payors. Additionally, HIPAA mandates the adoption of standards regarding the exchange of healthcare information in an effort to ensure the privacy and electronic security of patient information and standards relating to the privacy of health information. Sanctions for failing to comply with HIPAA include criminal penalties and civil sanctions. In February of 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) was signed into law. Title XIII of ARRA, HITECH, provided for substantial Medicare and Medicaid incentives for providers to adopt electronic health records (“EHRs”) and grants for the development of health information exchange (“HIE”). Recognizing that HIE and EHR systems will not be implemented unless the public can be assured that the privacy and security of patient information in such systems is protected, HITECH also significantly expanded the scope of the privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Most notable are the mandatory breach notification requirements and a heightened enforcement scheme that includes increased penalties, and which now apply to business associates as well as to covered entities. In addition to HIPAA, a number of states have adopted laws and/or regulations applicable in the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information that can be more stringent than comparable provisions under HIPAA.
In addition to HIPAA, there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns, including unauthorized access or theft of personal information. State statutes and regulations vary from state to state, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA.
We believe that our operations comply with applicable standards for privacy and security of protected healthcare information. We cannot predict what negative effect, if any, HIPAA/HITECH or any applicable state law or regulation will have on our business.
Other Regulatory Factors
Political, economic and regulatory influences are fundamentally changing the healthcare industry in the United States. Congress, state legislatures and the private sector continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems. Potential alternative approaches could include mandated basic healthcare benefits, controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and Medicare and Medicaid spending, the creation of large insurance purchasing groups, and price controls. Legislative debate is expected to continue in the future and market forces are expected to demand only modest increases or reduced costs. For instance, managed care entities are demanding lower reimbursement rates from healthcare providers and, in some cases, are requiring or encouraging providers to accept capitated payments that may not allow providers to cover their full costs or realize traditional levels of profitability. We cannot reasonably predict what impact the adoption of federal or state healthcare reform measures or future private sector reform may have on our business.
