ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are an innovative medical device company that is designing, developing and commercializing robotic exoskeletons that allow individuals with mobility impairments or other medical conditions the ability to stand and walk once again. We have developed and are continuing to commercialize ReWalk, an exoskeleton designed for individuals with paraplegia that uses our patented tilt-sensor technology and an on-board computer and motion sensors to drive motorized legs that power movement. Additionally, we are developing and intend to commercialize a lightweight soft exo-suit, designed to support mobility and/or therapy for individuals suffering from other lower limb disabilities such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, Parkinson’s disease and elderly assistance.
 
Development of ReWalk took over a decade and was spurred by the experiences of our founder, Dr. Amit Goffer, who became a quadriplegic due to an accident. Current ReWalk designs are intended for people with paraplegia, a spinal cord injury resulting in complete or incomplete paralysis of the legs, who have the use of their upper bodies and arms. We currently offer two products: ReWalk Personal and ReWalk Rehabilitation. ReWalk Personal is currently designed for everyday use by paraplegic individuals at home and in their communities, and is custom fitted for each user. ReWalk Rehabilitation is currently designed for use by paraplegia patients in the clinical rehabilitation environment, and provides valuable exercise and therapy. ReWalk Rehabilitation also enables individuals to evaluate their capacity for using ReWalk Personal in the future. In 2011, we launched ReWalk Rehabilitation for use in hospitals and rehabilitation centers in the United States and Europe. We began marketing ReWalk Personal in Europe with CE mark clearance at the end of 2012 and received U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, clearance to market it in the United States in June 2014. Additionally, we have received regulatory approval to sell the ReWalk device in other countries. In the future we intend to seek approval from the applicable regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions where we may seek to market ReWalk.
 
ReWalk is a breakthrough product that can fundamentally change the health and life experiences of users. Designed for all-day use, ReWalk is battery-powered and consists of a light, wearable exoskeleton with integrated motors at the joints, an array of sensors and a computer-based control system to power knee and hip movement. ReWalk controls movement using subtle shifts in the user’s center of gravity. A forward tilt of the upper body is sensed by the system, which initiates the first step. Repeated body shifting generates a sequence of steps that results in a functional walking speed. Because the exoskeleton supports its own weight and facilitates the user’s gait, users do not expend unnecessary energy while walking. While ReWalk does not allow side-to-side actuation, users are able to turn by shifting their weight to the side. ReWalk also allows users to sit, stand and, depending on local regulatory approvals, climb and descend stairs. Use on stairs is not cleared by the FDA in the United States. ReWalk users are able to operate the devices independently, and most are able to put on and remove the devices by themselves. Our safety guidelines and FDA specifications, however, require users to be accompanied by a trained companion at all times when using ReWalk.
 
Published clinical studies demonstrate ReWalk’s ability to deliver a functional walking speed. In addition, our experience working with healthcare practitioners and ReWalk users, including reports by study participants, as well as recently released clinical data suggest that ReWalk may have the potential to provide secondary health benefits. These potential benefits may include reducing pain and spasticity, improving bowel and urinary tract function, changing body and bone composition, enhancing metabolism and physical fitness, and reducing hospitalizations and dependence on medications, as well as emotional and psychological benefits. Because of these potential secondary medical benefits, we believe that ReWalk may have the ability to reduce the lifetime healthcare costs of individuals with spinal cord injuries, which we believe will make it economically attractive for individuals and third-party payors. While we believe that ReWalk could potentially offer significant advantages over competing technologies and therapies, disadvantages include the time it takes for a user to put on ReWalk, the slower pace of ReWalk compared to a wheelchair, the weight of ReWalk when carried, which makes it more burdensome for a companion to transport than a wheelchair, and the requirement that users be accompanied by a trained companion.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had placed 119 units in use at rehabilitation centers and 399 personal units in a home or community use, compared to 116 units and 317 units, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. In the near future, we intend to continue focusing on our reimbursement efforts, with our streamlined staffing, by pursuing insurance claims on a case-by-case basis, managing claims through the review process, and investing in efforts to expand commercial reimbursement coverage. During the year ended December 31, 2018, 38 units were paid for by insurance reimbursement compared to 44 units during the prior year. As of December 31, 2018, there were 217 pending insurance claims relating to coverage for our product, compared to 224 as of December 31, 2017.

Our initial commercialization efforts focused on penetrating rehabilitation centers, hospitals and similar facilities that treat patients with spinal cord injuries to become an integral part of their rehabilitation programs and to develop a broad based training network with these facilities to prepare users for home and community use. According to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, 87% of persons with spinal cord injuries are sent to private, non-institutional residences (in most cases, their homes) after hospital discharge. As our business has developed, we have shifted our commercialization efforts to marketing ReWalk Personal with insurance companies, physicians and physiotherapists as a standard of care that can be used routinely at home, work or in the community, and we expect sales of ReWalk Personal to account for the substantial majority of our revenues in the future. Our principal markets are the United States and Europe. In Europe we have a direct sales operation in Germany and United Kingdom and work with distribution partners in certain other major countries.
 
We have in the past generated and expect to generate in the future revenues from a combination of third-party payors, self-payors, including private and government employers, and institutions. While a broad uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement by third-party commercial payors currently does not exist in the United States for electronic exoskeleton technologies such as ReWalk, we are pursuing various paths of reimbursement and support fundraising efforts by institutions and clinics. In December 2015, the Veterans’ Administration, or the VA, issued a national policy for the evaluation, training and procurement of ReWalk Personal exoskeleton systems for all qualifying veterans across the United States. The VA policy is the first national coverage policy in the United States for qualifying individuals who have suffered spinal cord injury. As of December 31, 2018, we had placed 19 units as part of the VA policy. In June 2018, the VA updated its national policy to provide expanded access to ReWalk exoskeletons for veterans in private rehabilitation clinics through the Veterans Choice Program. Under the VA’s revised policy, the exoskeleton evaluation process will have all veterans flow through one of 24 designated spinal cord injury VA centers (which we refer to as “SCI/D”). Once a veteran is determined to be qualified for training and procurement of his/her own exoskeleton system, the individual may be allowed to pursue training on exoskeleton use, such as use of the ReWalk (i) at the applicable SCI/D hub center; (ii) on a case-by-case basis, at a qualified VA hospital designated by the VA’s “hub & spoke” program; or (iii) on a case-by-case basis, at a qualified private rehabilitation center via the VA’s Veteran’s Choice Program, through which veterans can receive care from a community provider paid for by the VA. We continue to work with the VA to accelerate the pace of implementation of the VA policy.
 
To date, several statutory and private insurers in the United States and Europe have provided reimbursement for ReWalk in certain cases. Additionally, in September 2017, each of German insurer BARMER GEK, or Barmer, and national social accident insurance provider Deutsche Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung, or DGUV, signed a confirmation and letter of agreement, respectively, regarding the provision of ReWalk systems for all qualifying beneficiaries. In February 2018, the head office of German statutory health insurance, or SHI, Spitzenverband (GKV) confirmed its decision to list the ReWalk Personal 6.0 Exoskeleton System in the German Medical Device Directory, and in June 2018, the ReWalk Personal was added to the official German list of medical aids. This decision means that ReWalk is now listed as the first and only exoskeleton among all medical devices for compensation, which SHI providers can procure for any approved beneficiary on a case-by-case basis. In March 2018, the Italian Ministry of Labor and Social Policy’s statutory insurance corporation put in place a coverage policy that will provide exoskeleton systems for all qualifying beneficiaries. This policy, the first of its kind in Italy, will provide individuals with spinal cord injury access to obtain their own medical device so that they can stand and walk again. 
 
In June 2017 we unveiled our lightweight exo-suit ReStore system designed initially for rehabilitation of stroke patients. We created the ReStore system through our ongoing collaboration with Harvard University’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, pursuant to which Harvard licenses to us intellectual property relating to lightweight exo-suit system technologies for lower limb disabilities, as we develop, introduce and commercialize products under the license. We applied for CE mark at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2018 and intend to apply for FDA clearance imminently. For more information on the Restore system, see “Future Products”. For more information on the collaboration with Harvard, see “Research and Development-Research and Development Collaborations.”

Overview of Spinal Anatomy and Spinal Cord Injury
 
Spinal Anatomy
 
The spine is the central core of the human skeleton and provides structural support, alignment and flexibility to the body. It consists of 24 interlocking bones, called vertebrae, which are stacked on top of one another. The spine is comprised of five regions, of which there are three primary regions: cervical, thoracic and lumbar. In addition, there is also the sacral region, or sacrum, a triangular-shaped bone and the coccyx, or “tailbone,” the bottom portion of the spine.
 
The spinal cord, housed inside the bony spinal column, is a complex bundle of nerves serving as the main pathway for information connecting the brain and nervous system. The spinal cord is divided into 31 segments that feed sensory impulses into the spinal cord, which in turn relays them to the brain. Conversely, motor impulses generated in the brain are relayed by the spinal cord to the spinal nerves, which pass the impulses to muscles and glands. The spinal cord mediates the reflex responses to some sensory impulses directly, without recourse to the brain, for example, when a person’s leg is tapped, producing the knee jerk reflex.
 

Spinal Cord Injury | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------
Spinal cord injury is the result of a direct trauma to the nerves themselves or damage to the surrounding bones and soft tissues which ultimately impacts the spinal cord. Spinal cord damage results in a loss of function, such as mobility or feeling. In most people who have spinal cord injury, the spinal cord is intact. Spinal cord injury is not the same as back injury, which may result from pinched nerves or ruptured disks. Even when a person sustains a break in a vertebra or vertebrae, there may not be any spinal cord injury if the spinal cord itself is not affected. There are two types of spinal cord injury – complete and incomplete. In a complete injury, a person loses all ability to feel and voluntarily move below the level of the injury. In an incomplete injury, there is some functioning below the level of the injury. Upon examination, a patient is assigned a level of injury depending on the location of the spinal cord injury. Cervical level injuries cause paralysis or weakness in both arms and legs and is referred to as quadriplegia. Sometimes this type of injury is accompanied by loss of physical sensation, respiratory issues, bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction. Thoracic level injuries can cause paralysis or weakness of the legs (paraplegia) along with loss of physical sensation, bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction. In most cases, arms and hands are not affected. Lumbar level injuries result in paralysis or weakness of the legs (paraplegia). Loss of physical sensation, bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction can occur. The shoulder, arm, and hand functions are usually unaffected. Sacral level injuries primarily cause loss of bowel and bladder function as well as sexual dysfunction. |

Market Opportunity
 
ReWalk’s current and near term market opportunities include providing a solution for persons with spinal cord injury that can be used in the clinic and/or home settings, and a solution for therapists to use during stroke rehabilitation in their clinics. Products based on our exoskeleton and exo-suit technologies may also be developed to address other forms of lower limb disability. For persons with spinal cord injury, confinement to a wheelchair can cause severe physical and psychological deterioration, resulting in bad health, poor quality of life, low self-esteem and high medical expenses. In addition, the secondary medical consequences of paralysis can include difficulty with bowel and urinary tract function, osteoporosis, loss of lean mass, gain in fat mass, insulin resistance, diabetes and heart disease. The cost of treating these conditions is substantial. The National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, or the NSCISC, estimates that complications related to paraplegia cost, excluding indirect costs such as losses in wages, fringe benefits and productivity, approximately $500,000 in the first year post-injury and significant additional amounts over the course of an individual’s lifetime. Further, secondary complications related to spinal cord injury can reduce life expectancies for spinal cord injury, or SCI, patients. The young average age at time of injury and significant remaining life expectancy, the likelihood of living at home and lifetime cost of treatment highlight the need for an out-of-hospital solution with demonstrated health and social benefits.
 
The NSCISC estimates as of 2018 that there were 288,000 people in the United States living with spinal cord injury or SCI, with an annual incidence of approximately 17,700 new cases per year. Approximately 44,000 of such patients are veterans, and are eligible for medical care and other benefits from the VA. With 24 VA spinal cord injury centers, the VA has the largest single network of spinal cord injury care in the United States.
 
The University of Alabama-Birmingham Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation operates the NSCISC, which maintains the world’s largest database on spinal cord injury research. Since 2010, motor vehicle crashes have been the leading cause of reported spinal cord injury cases (38%), followed by falls (32%), acts of violence (14%) and sports injuries (8%). 78% of spinal cord injuries occur among the male population. According to NSCISC data, upon hospital discharge, 87% of persons with spinal cord injuries are sent to private, non-institutional residence (in most cases, their homes prior to injury).
 
Based on information from a 2017 report by the NSCISC, 40.4% of the total U.S. population of SCI patients suffered injuries between levels T4 and L5. Three published ReWalk trials for SCI patients had an aggregate screening acceptance rate of 79% considering all current FDA limitations, resulting in an estimated 32% of the total population of SCI patients being candidates for current ReWalk products. For important qualifying information about this determination, see “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors-The market for medical exoskeletons is new and unproven, and important assumptions about the potential market for our products may be inaccurate.”
 
Regarding the potential market for the lightweight soft suit exoskeleton, designed to support mobility for individuals suffering from other lower limb disabilities such as stroke and multiple sclerosis, according to American Heart Association, more than 6.5 million Americans have suffered a stroke, with 795,000 new incidences expected each year. Physical limitations after stroke vary from case to case, but approximately 60% of these individuals will have lower limb disability, which could require them to seek gait training as part of their overall therapy plan.
 
The Multiple Sclerosis Foundation estimates that nearly 1.0 million people in the United States and about 2.3 million people around the world have multiple sclerosis. About 10,000 new cases are diagnosed annually in the United States. Research indicates that approximately 75% of patients with multiple sclerosis experience clinically significant walking disturbance, and 89% of patients with moderate Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores (4.0-5.5) had walking disability. Individuals with of less than EDSS 4.0 generally do not need a robotic mobility aid, while individuals with EDSS 7.0 are generally restricted to a wheelchair. Multiple sclerosis is a progressive disease, as approximately one-third of multiple sclerosis patients end up with full paralysis while two-thirds remain able to walk, though many will need an aid, such as a cane or crutches, and some will use a scooter or wheelchair due to fatigue, weakness or balance problems, or due to a need to conserve energy.

Our Solutions
 
Designed for all-day use and worn over the clothes of users, the ReWalk device consists of a light wearable exoskeleton with integrated motors at the joints, an array of sensors and a backpack or waist pack that contains the batteries and the computer-based control system. The control system utilizes proprietary algorithms to analyze upper-body motions and trigger and maintain gait patterns and other modes of operation (such as stair-climbing and shifting from sitting to standing), leaving the user’s hands free for self-support and other functions. Because the exoskeleton supports its own weight, users do not expend unnecessary energy while walking. Safety measures include crutches, which provide additional stability, fall protection, which lowers users slowly and safely in the event of a malfunction, and the secure “stand” mode, which automatically initiates if the user does not begin walking within two seconds. ReWalk is also equipped with maintenance alarms, warnings and backup batteries. The rechargeable batteries are easily accessible and can be recharged in any standard power outlet. Upon completion of training, which generally consists of approximately 15 one-hour sessions, most users are able to put on and remove the device by themselves while sitting, typically in less than 15 minutes.
 
As discussed above, current ReWalk designs are intended for people with paraplegia who have the use of their upper bodies and arms. We currently offer two ReWalk products: ReWalk Personal and ReWalk Rehabilitation. For a breakdown of our revenues from sales of each of ReWalk Personal and ReWalk Rehabilitation, see “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------
● | ReWalk Personal: intended for everyday use at home, at work or in the community. We began marketing ReWalk Personal in Europe with CE mark clearance at the end of 2012. We received FDA clearance to market ReWalk Personal in the United States in June 2014. ReWalk Personal units are all manufactured according to the same mechanical specifications. Each unit is then permanently sized to fit the individual user and the software is configured for the user’s specifications by the rehabilitation center, clinic or distributor. | 
● | ReWalk Rehabilitation: designed for the clinical rehabilitation environment, ReWalk Rehabilitation has adjustable sizing enabling multiple patient use. ReWalk Rehabilitation provides a valuable means of exercise and therapy. It also enables individuals to evaluate their capacity for using ReWalk Personal in the future. We began marketing ReWalk Rehabilitation for use in hospitals, rehabilitation centers and stand-alone training centers in the United States and Europe in 2011. ReWalk Rehabilitation units are all manufactured according to the same mechanical specifications and are equipped with adjustable sizing for multi-patient use and software that can be configured for the user’s specifications. 



We anticipate that the next generation of ReWalk will be a structural exoskeleton similar to our existing ReWalk devices, with a range of improvements including additional functionality, more efficient drive mechanism, slimmer profile and lighter body, as well as other improvements.

Future Products
 
In June 2017, we unveiled our lightweight exo-suit ReStore system designed initially for rehabilitation of stroke patients. We created the ReStore system through our ongoing collaboration with Harvard University’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, pursuant to which Harvard licenses to us intellectual property relating to lightweight exo-suit system technologies for lower limb disabilities, as we develop, introduce and commercialize products under the license.
 
The Restore transmits power to the ankle of the impaired -leg with motor-driven cable technologies, applying software and mechanics similar to the technologies employed in the currently-marketed ReWalk structural exoskeleton systems. The system is designed to allow a user’s unimpaired leg to adjust and assist the leg with mobility impairments affected by stroke. The exoskeletal suit consists of a lightweight fabric-based structure that wraps around the waist and supports an actuator with a motor, computer and cable, along with sensors attached to a stable point on the user’s calf and footplate in the user’s shoe. This design transfers force in a controlled manner, enabling both powered plantarflexion, or bending to decrease the angle between the sole of the foot and the back of the leg, and powered dorsiflexion, or bending to decrease the angle between the upper surface of the foot and the front of the leg. We believe that the ReStore system’s soft, lightweight material will facilitate a natural walking pattern for patients using the device. The ReStore system is also designed to provide advantages to stroke rehabilitation clinics and therapists as compared to other traditional therapies and devices by improving the quality and pace of care, supplying real-time analytics to optimize session productivity and generating ongoing data reports to assist with tracking patient progress. We expect the device may also provide other secondary benefits for rehabilitation clinics, including reducing staffing and/ or equipment requirements, staff fatigue and the risk for potential staff injuries. The Company has completed a prospective clinical study on the ReStore system to assess the safety of the ReStore system during gait training in stroke patients in a rehabilitation setting. The full study was designed to involve 40 patients each partaking in seven training sessions at five designated stroke research centers, all of which received the requisite Internal Review Board approval to conduct the ongoing study.
 

We intend to commercialize the ReStore exo-suit system to rehabilitation clinics and therapists in Europe and the United States during the third quarter of 2019 if we receive CE mark and FDA clearance, respectively, to market the device. We applied for CE mark at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2018 and intend to apply for FDA clearance imminently. Obtaining clearance could involve an extensive and time-consuming process and delay commercialization beyond our planned timetable, and we cannot make any assurances regarding the ultimate timing of FDA clearance or CE mark or commercialization of the products. For more information on the clearance processes, see “Part I, Item 1. Business—Government Regulation”. |

Third-Party Reimbursements
 
United States
 
In the United States rehabilitation centers generally purchase the ReWalk Rehabilitation unit and then charge patients for ReWalk therapy on a per-session basis. These institutions may then seek reimbursement from insurance companies for each session.
 
In December 2015, the VA issued a national policy for the evaluation, training and procurement of ReWalk Personal exoskeleton systems for all qualifying veterans across the United States.  The VA policy is the first national coverage policy in the United States for qualifying individuals who have suffered spinal cord injury.
 
While no broad uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for electronic exoskeleton medical technology exists among commercial insurance payors in the United States, reimbursement may be achieved on a case-by-case basis. To date, payments for the ReWalk Personal device have been made primarily through case-by-case determinations by third-party payors, including commercial insurers in the United States, by self-payors and donations and, to a lesser extent, through the use of funds from insurance and/or accident settlements.
 
Generally, commercial insurance companies do not currently cover or provide broad reimbursement policies for any personal medical exoskeleton products, including ReWalk Personal, and coverage determinations are limited to case-by-case decisions. As of December 31, 2018, we had 88 cases pending in the United States for insurance coverage decisions. For more information, see “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry-We may fail to secure or maintain adequate insurance coverage or reimbursement for ReWalk by third-party payors….”
 
As part of our plan for growth, we intend to continue working with both national and regional commercial insurance companies, health care practitioners, physicians, researchers, and the SCI community to support efforts to demonstrate the benefits and the case to secure potential coverage policies based on supportive data and appeal rulings that have deemed exoskeleton devices a “medically necessary” standard of care for individuals with SCI. During 2018 we submitted data to a substantial number of U.S. commercial insurance groups for policy review and, our efforts in the future will be focused on continued education of insurers through data application, working with advocacy groups and ongoing communication.
 
In the future, we will pursue coverage through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS. While we believe that a positive response from CMS may broaden coverage by private insurers, we cannot currently predict how long it would take for us to receive a decision from CMS, but we believe that other sources of payment will be sufficient to support our business.For more information, see “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry-We may fail to secure or maintain adequate insurance coverage or reimbursement for ReWalk by third-party payors…”
 
Western Europe
 
Reimbursement for ReWalk in Europe varies by country and historically certain third-party payors have provided reimbursement for our products in certain cases in Germany and Italy.
 
We initially focused our efforts in Europe in Germany where we continue to make progress toward achieving ReWalk coverage from the various government, private and worker’s compensation payers. Specifically:
 

● | In September 2017, Barmer confirmed it will provide ReWalk systems to all qualifying beneficiaries. Barmer provides insurance coverage for nearly ten million people in Germany, as a member of the German Statutory Health Insurance (“SHI”) network and one of the most significant national insurers in the country. Exoskeletons will be provided to users that meet certain inclusion criteria and assessment by the German Health Insurance Medical Service (Medizinischer Dienst der Krankenversicherungen) before and after training. Barmer has already begun processing claims with users entering training for in-home use of an exoskeleton. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In September 2017 Germany’s national social accident insurance provider, DGUV, signed a confirmation letter with ReWalk, stipulating that the DGUV’s member payers, including the health insurance association Berufsgenossenschaft (also known as BG) and state insurers, will approve the supply of exoskeleton systems for qualifying beneficiaries on a case-by-case basis. DGUV is comprised of 35 different insurers, which provide coverage for more than 70 million individuals in Germany. Per the agreement, eligible individuals will go to BG clinics for evaluation as a part of the procurement.

In February 2018, the GKV confirmed its decision to list the ReWalk Personal system in the German MDD, a comprehensive list of all medical devices which are principally and regularly reimbursed by German SHI providers. The ReWalk Personal was added to the official German list of medical aids, code number 23.29.01.2001, in June 2018, this decision means that ReWalk Personal will be listed among all medical devices for compensation, which SHI providers can procure for any approved beneficiary on a case-by-case basis.
 
Patients who are covered under these policies must be medically evaluated for their eligibility to use the ReWalk Personal device. If medically qualified, the patient, along with his or her physician, must apply for coverage of the device. We expect that these payers will establish processes for patients to be evaluated, trained and procure a ReWalk Personal device over the coming months, making the process to receive a device more routine for a qualifying individual. Patients who are not covered under Barmer’s or the BG’s policies stated above must apply for coverage to use ReWalk. If such patient is denied, then such patient must appeal the decision in court, relying on supporting documentation from a health care provider and other medical evidence. As of December 31, 2018, there were 129 insurance cases pending in Germany, including 35 insurance cases pending with Barmer and the BG. We believe that our recent coverage decisions and the existing claims will eventually lead other German insurers including Private Health Insurance (“PHI”), to provide coverage on a broad scale. For more information, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-We may fail to secure or maintain adequate insurance coverage or reimbursement for ReWalk by third-party payors, including the VA, which risk may be heightened if insurers find ReWalk to be investigational or experimental or if new government regulations change existing reimbursement policies.”
 
We continue to support clinical research and academic publications, which we believe will further support the case for coverage.
 
We are also pursuing reimbursement by private insurers and worker’s compensation in various European countries.
 
Other Funding Sources
 
In addition to being funded by third-party payors, including private insurance plans, government programs such as the VA, and Worker’s Compensation, ReWalk is also funded by self-payers. This includes individuals who purchase ReWalk with funds from legal settlements with insurance companies or third parties.
Research and Development
 
We are committed to investing in a robust research and development program to enhance our current ReWalk products and to develop our pipeline of new and complementary products, and we believe that ongoing research and development efforts are essential to our success. Our research and development team consists of both in-house and external staff, including engineers, machinists, researchers and marketing, quality, manufacturing, regulatory and clinical personnel, which we employ in the most efficient way we can and see fit to our current and future needs, who work closely together to design, enhance and validate our technologies. This research and development team conceptualizes technologies and then builds and tests prototypes before refining and/or redesigning as necessary. Our regulatory and clinical personnel work in parallel with engineers and researchers, allowing us to anticipate and resolve potential issues at early stages in the development cycle.
 
We plan to focus our research and development efforts in the future by continually improving and expanding our functional technological platform, specifically, in the shorter term, by commercializing a lightweight “soft suit” exoskeleton device that will assist patients who had stroke, and in the longer term by developing our next generation of ReWalk with design improvements, and depending on our future resources, building upon our technological platform to address new medical indications that affect the ability to walk including multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, Parkinson’s disease and elderly assistance.
 
We conduct our research and development efforts at our facility in Yokneam, Israel. We believe that the close interaction among our research and development, marketing and manufacturing groups allows for timely and effective realization of our new product concepts.

Our research and development efforts have been financed, in part, through funding from the Israel Innovation Authority, or the IIA (formerly known as Office of the Chief Scientist in the Israel Ministry of Economy), and from the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development, or BIRD Foundation. From our inception through December 31, 2018, we received funding totaling $1.97 million from the IIA and $500 thousand from the BIRD Foundation. For more information regarding our research and development financing arrangements, see “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “—Grants and Other Funding.”
 
Research and Development Collaborations
 
On May 16, 2016, we entered into the Research Collaboration Agreement, or Collaboration Agreement, and the Exclusive License Agreement with Harvard, or Harvard License Agreement. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we and Harvard agreed to collaborate on research regarding the development of lightweight soft suit exoskeleton system technologies for lower limb disabilities, which are intended to treat stroke, multiple sclerosis, mobility limitations for the elderly and other medical applications. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we must pay Harvard quarterly installment payments to help fund the research. Subject to the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, we and Harvard are required to report our respective research results and findings to each other on a regular basis. The Collaboration Agreement governs ownership of the research results and inventions generated in performance of the research collaboration, and provides us the option to negotiate with Harvard for a license to certain new inventions of Harvard conceived in performance of the collaboration.
 
The Collaboration Agreement was amended on April 1, 2018 to extend the term of the Collaboration Agreement by one year to May 16, 2022 and reallocate the Company’s quarterly installment payments to Harvard through such date, and to make certain technical changes. Subject to payment of a minimum funding commitment under applicable circumstances, we may terminate the agreement if there is a loss of Harvard’s principal investigator or if we do not believe that we have or can secure sufficient funding to proceed. The Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated by either Harvard or us due to a material uncured breach by the other party or upon termination of the Harvard License Agreement.
 
Under the Harvard License Agreement, we are granted an exclusive, worldwide royalty-bearing license under certain patents of Harvard relating to lightweight “soft suit” exoskeleton system technologies for lower limb disabilities, a royalty-free license under certain related know-how and the option to obtain a license under certain inventions conceived under our joint research collaboration. Harvard retains the right to practice the patents for research, educational and scholarly purposes. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop products under the license in accordance with an agreed-upon development plan and to introduce and market such products commercially. In addition to an upfront fee and royalties on net sales, we are obligated to pay Harvard certain milestone payments upon the achievement of certain product development and commercialization milestones. We also agreed to reimburse Harvard for expenses incurred in connection with the filing, prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents.
 
The Harvard License Agreement will continue in full force and effect until the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the licensed patents. We may terminate License the Agreement for any reason upon 60 days’ prior written notice, while Harvard may terminate the Agreement if we do not obtain requisite insurance, becomes insolvent or fail to meet certain development milestones. The Harvard License Agreement may also be terminated by Harvard or us due to the other party’s material uncured breach.
 
 The Collaboration Agreement and Harvard License Agreement contain, as applicable, customary representations and warranties and customary enforcement, indemnification and insurance provisions. For further discussion of the Collaboration Agreement and Harvard License Agreement, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Date.” 
 
In September 2013, we entered into a strategic alliance with Yaskawa Electric Corporation (“Yaskawa”), pursuant to which, among other arrangements, Yaskawa can apply its expertise in product and quality improvements to ReWalk and assist in marketing, distributing and commercializing on an exclusive basis our products in Japan, China and other East Asian countries. Yaskawa is a global leader in the fields of industrial robotics and automation. While we have not engaged in joint initiatives with Yaskawa to date, we believe that this relationship may provide us with opportunities for product improvement and increased product offerings in the future. In connection with the closing of the first tranche of the private placement of our ordinary shares to Timwell, we amended our exclusive distribution agreement with Yaskawa on May 15, 2018 to terminate the distribution rights granted to Yaskawa in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). For more information on the Timwell private placement, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources- Timwell Private Placement.” and for more information regarding our relationship with Yaskawa generally, see “—Sales and Marketing” and “Part III. Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.”

Clinical Studies
 
Multiple clinical studies, some of which are published in peer-reviewed journals, have been carried out to establish the effectiveness and benefits of ReWalk for individuals with spinal cord injuries. Certain of the benefits tested include:

● | reduced pain; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | improved bowel and urinary tract function; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reduced spasticity; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | increases in joint range of motion for the hip and ankle joints; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | improved sleep and reduced fatigue; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increase in oxygen uptake and heart rate as a result of walking as opposed to sitting and standing; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ability to ambulate at a speed greater than 0.4 meters per second, which is considered to be conducive to outdoor related community ambulation; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reduced hospitalizations. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Although study participants and other ReWalk users have reported the secondary health benefits listed above, currently there is no conclusive clinical data establishing any secondary health benefits of ReWalk.
 
Community Engagement and Education

We devote significant resources to engagement with and education of the spinal cord injury community with respect to the benefits of ReWalk. We actively seek opportunities to partner with hospitals, rehabilitation centers and key opinion leaders to engage in research and development and clinical activities. We also seek to educate and gain support from organizations such as patient advocacy groups and clinician societies with the goal of promoting adoption of exoskeleton technology from patient, clinician and payor communities. We believe that our success has been, and will continue to be driven in part by, our reputation and acceptance within the spinal cord injury community.
 
To date, multiple advocacy groups have issued public endorsement to cover the ReWalk device, including leading United States-based national organizations such as the United Spinal Association and the Dana and Christopher Reeves Foundation, as well as others.


Sales and Marketing
 
We market and sell our products directly to third party payers, institutions, including rehabilitation centers, individuals and through third-party distributors. We sell our products directly in Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States and primarily through distributors in our other markets. In our direct markets, we have established relationships with rehabilitation centers and the spinal cord injury community, and in our indirect markets, our distributors maintain these relationships. Sales of ReWalk Personal are generated primarily from the patient base at our rehabilitation centers, referrals through the spinal cord injury community and direct inquiries from potential users. The VA accounted for 38.0% and 35.2% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
In 2018 and into 2019 we also began preparing for the anticipated launch of the ReStore exo-suit for gait training during stroke rehabilitation. This product will be marketed and sold directly to rehabilitation clinics for use during the course of the treatment of their patients. We are actively engaging with stroke rehab clinics and clinicians in our direct markets to identify and prepare potential customers.

We have established centers of operations in Marlborough, Massachusetts, Berlin, Germany and Yokneam, Israel, to manage sales in North America, Europe, and the rest of world, respectively.
 
Services and Customer Support
 
Our centers of operations in Marlborough, Massachusetts and Berlin, Germany coordinate all customer support and product service functions for North America and Europe, respectively, through dedicated technical service personnel who provide product services and customer support through training to healthcare providers and support to product users.
Competition
 
The market in which we operate is characterized by active competition and rapid technological change, and we expect competition to increase. Competition arises from providers of other mobility systems and prosthetic devices used in the clinic and/or home settings.
 
We are aware of a number of other companies developing competing technology and devices, and some of these competitors may have greater resources, greater name recognition, broader product lines, or larger customer bases than we do.
 
Our principal competitors in the medical exoskeleton market consist of Ekso Bionics (OTC: EKSO), Rex Bionics Pty, Cyberdyne (Tokyo Stock Exchange: 7779), Parker Hannifin (NYSE: PH), Hocoma, AlterG, and Bioness.
 
These products may also compete with the ReStore exo-suit, as will manual forms of gait training which do not involve robotic assistive devices.


We believe that our ReWalk Personal device possesses key competitive advantages over these companies, such as our tilt-sensor technology that provides a self-initiated walking experience, more natural gait and faster functional walking speed, the ability to support its own weight and broad user specifications. ReWalk Personal is the first medical exoskeleton cleared by the FDA for personal use in the United States.
 
We believe that our ReStore soft exo-suit device will have key competitive advantages over the products of our competitors, including a design that facilitates a natural walking pattern through flexible materials, sensors, and powered plantarflexion and dorsiflexion, making it the only solution of its type of which we are aware that supports such movements, achieving that with a lower cost and weight than rigid skeletal devices.
 
In addition, we compete with alternative devices and alternative therapies, including treadmill-based gait therapies, such as those offered by Hocoma, AlterG, Aretech and Reha Technology. Other medical device or robotics companies, academic and research institutions, or others may develop new technologies or therapies that provide a superior walking experience, are more effective in treating the secondary medical conditions that we target or are less expensive than our current or future products. Our technologies and products could be rendered obsolete by such developments.
 
We may also compete with other treatments and technologies that address the secondary medical conditions that ReWalk seeks to mitigate.

Intellectual Property
 
Protection of our intellectual property is important to our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, trademarks, confidentiality and assignment agreements with our employees and certain of our contractors and confidentiality agreements with certain of our consultants, scientific advisors and other vendors and contractors. In addition, we rely on trade secrets law to protect our proprietary software and product candidates/products in development.
 
In addition to ReWalk’s portfolio of issued patents and pending patent applications, the Company licenses certain patented and patented pending technology from a third party as described above under the “Research and Development” section.
 
As of February 1, 2019, we have seven issued patents in the United States and ten issued patents outside of the United States, as well as 22 pending patent applications in various countries around the world for our technology including the United States and Europe. As such, we have apparatus patent claims in the United States and Europe covering aspects of ReWalk and similar devices which use a plurality of sensors to empower tilt-sensor technology. In addition, in the United States and Europe, we have method patent claims covering certain methods of user activation and control of systems such as ReWalk, including by sensing the user’s torso lean or weight shifts. While our apparatus claims focus on protecting ReWalk in terms of its physical and structural characteristics, we believe that our method claims, which protect the process behind how ReWalk is controlled by the user, provide additional protection for our tilt sensor technology. We do not currently license any of the technology contained in our currently commercialized products other than with respect to technology that is generally publicly available, but we may do so in the future.
 
Patents filed both in the United States and Europe generally have a life of 20 years from the filing date. As the oldest of our issued patents relating to our tilt-sensor technology was filed in May 2001, our patents on that technology do not begin to expire until May 2021.
 
We currently hold a registered trademark in the United States and Israel for the mark “ReWalk”. We currently hold registered trademark in Europe and in the process of registering the mark “Restore” in the United States and South Korea.
 
The employment agreement of our founder and former President and Chief Technology Officer, Dr. Amit Goffer, provides that a patent pending relating to a standing wheelchair is his individual property and that he may independently engage in the development of a standing wheelchair. The agreement also provides that we and any of our affiliates or successors have the royalty-free right to the exclusive use in the field of exoskeletons of any intellectual property developed by Dr. Goffer, alone or jointly with others (whether or not as part of the development of a standing wheelchair and whether or not developed through a company), while he is our employee, consultant or board member and for three years thereafter. Mr. Goffer retired from serving as our President and Chief Technology Officer on November 18, 2015, and as a member of our board of directors on December 3, 2015.
 
We cannot be sure that our intellectual property will provide us with a competitive advantage or that we will not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. In addition, we cannot be sure that any patents will be granted in a timely manner or at all with respect to any of our patent pending applications. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”

Government Regulation
 
U.S. Regulation
 
Our medical products and manufacturing operations are regulated by the FDA and other federal and state agencies. Our products are regulated as medical devices in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FFDCA, as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, installation, servicing, advertising, promotion, marketing, distribution, import, export, and market surveillance of our medical devices.
Premarket Regulatory Requirements
 
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, approval of a premarket approval application (PMA), or issuance of a de novo order. Under the FFDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Classification of a device is important because the class to which a device is assigned determines, among other things, the necessity and type of FDA review required prior to marketing the device. Class I devices are those for which reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to general controls that include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class I also includes devices for which there is insufficient information to determine that general controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device or to establish special controls to provide such assurance, but that are not life-supporting or life-sustaining or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, and that do not present a potential unreasonable risk of illness of injury.
 
Class II devices are those for which general controls alone are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness and there is sufficient information to establish “special controls.” These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, most Class II devices require a 510(k) premarket notification to be marketed in the U.S. As a result, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA premarket notifications under Section 510(k) of the FFDCA requesting classification of their devices in order to market or commercially distribute those devices. To obtain a 510(k), a substantial equivalence determination for their devices, manufacturers must submit to the FDA premarket notifications demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, or PMA, meaning, (i) a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, (ii) a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or (iii) a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous premarket approval requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for medical devices that are low to moderate risk, but are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.
 
Devices that are intended to be life sustaining or life supporting, devices that are implantable, devices that present a potential unreasonable risk of harm or are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of health, and devices that are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device are placed in Class III and generally require approval of a PMA, unless the device is a pre-amendment device not yet subject to a regulation requiring premarket approval. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FFDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years.
 
 13

 

Clinical trials are almost always required to support PMAs and are sometimes required to support 510(k) submissions. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, the agency requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA denies the application or notifies the company that the investigation is on hold and may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE that require modification of the study, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still comply with abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements.
 
In June 2014, the FDA granted our petition for “de novo” classification, which provides a route to market for medical devices that are low to moderate risk, but are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, and classified ReWalk as Class II subject to special controls. The ReWalk is intended to enable individuals with spinal cord injuries to perform ambulatory functions under supervision of a specially trained companion, and inside rehabilitation institutions. The special controls established in the de novo order include the following: compliance with medical device consensus standards; clinical testing to demonstrate safe and effective use considering the level of supervision necessary and the use environment; non-clinical performance testing, including durability testing to demonstrate that the device performs as intended under anticipated conditions of use; a training program; and labeling related to device use and user training. The special controls of this de novo order also apply to competing products seeking FDA clearance. For more information, see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Government Regulation-We are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products, and a failure to comply with such regulations could lead to withdrawal or recall of our products from the market.
 
Post-market Regulatory Requirements
 
After a device is cleared for marketing, and prior to marketing, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:
 

● | establishment registration and device listing; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | development of a quality assurance system, including establishing and implementing procedures to design and manufacture devices; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations that prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA’s Unique Device Identification requirements that call for a unique device identifier (UDI) on device labels and packages and submission of data to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID); 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device reporting regulations that require manufacturers to report to the FDA if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and corrections and removal reporting regulations that require manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a risk to health; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Post-market surveillance.
--+--------------------------

 
 14

 

ReWalk is required by an FDA order under Section 522 of the FFDCA to conduct a post-market study of the ReWalk device. We launched our post-market surveillance study with Stanford University during the second quarter of 2016. For more information on the post-market surveillance study, see “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Government Regulation.”
 
Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation that covers the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. We actively maintain compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, 21 CFR Part 820, and the European Union’s Quality Management Systems requirements, ENISO 13485:2012.
 
As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. If the FDA believes we or any of our contract manufacturers are not in compliance with the quality system requirements, or other post-market requirements, it has significant enforcement authority. Specifically, if the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
 

● | untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | customer notifications or repair, replacement or refunds; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or approval of pre-market approval applications relating to new products or modified products; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reclassifying a 510(k) cleared device or withdrawing PMA approval; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal to grant export approvals for our products; or 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | pursuing criminal prosecution. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, these regulatory controls, as well as any changes in FDA policies, can affect the time and cost associated with the development, introduction and continued availability of new products. Where possible, we anticipate these factors in our product development processes.
 
Regulation outside of the U.S.

In addition to the United States regulations, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. In particular, we are subject to regulation in the E.U., which has directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event (i.e. vigilance) reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive are entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directive and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout Europe. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third party assessment by a “Notified Body.” This third party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system or specific testing of the manufacturer’s product. We comply with the E.U. requirements and have received the CE mark for all of our ReWalk systems distributed in the E.U.
 
Foreign sales outside of the E.U. are subject to the foreign government regulations of the relevant jurisdiction, and we must obtain approval by the appropriate regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing activities in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain a marketing authorization in the Unites States or the E.U. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
In 2017, the European Union adopted a new Medical Device Regulation, which will repeal and replace the existing directives effective May 26, 2020. The new regulation does not set out a radically new system, but envisages, among other things, stricter controls of medical devices, including strengthening of the conformity assessment procedures, increased expectations with regard to clinical data for devices and pre-market regulatory review of high-risk devices. Under transitional provisions, medical devices with notified body certificates issued under the existing directives prior to May 26, 2020 may continue to be placed on the market for the remaining validity of the certificate, until May 27, 2024 at the latest. After the expiry of any applicable transitional period, only devices that have been CE marked under the new regulation may be placed on the market in the E.U.
 
 15

 

The policies of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products and could also increase the cost of regulatory compliance. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.
 
U.S. Anti-kickback, False Claims and Other Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
In the United States, there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. These laws apply to manufacturers of products, such as us, with respect to our financial relationship with hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers or acquirers of our products. The U.S. government has published regulations that identify “safe harbors” or exemptions for certain practices from enforcement actions under the federal anti-kickback statute, and we will seek to comply with the safe harbors where possible. To qualify for a safe harbor, the activity must fit squarely within the safe harbor. Arrangements that do not meet a safe harbor are not necessarily illegal, but must be evaluated on a case by case basis. Other provisions of state and federal law provide civil and criminal penalties for presenting, or causing to be presented, to third-party payers for reimbursement claims that are false or fraudulent, or for items or services that were not provided as claimed. False claims allegations under federal and some state laws may be brought on behalf of the government by private persons, “whistleblowers,” who then receive a share of any recovery.
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. The PPACA also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals. Device manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. A number of provisions of PPACA also reflect increased focus on and funding of healthcare fraud enforcement.
 
In September 2017, members of the U.S. Congress introduced legislation with the announced intention to repeal and replace major provisions of the PPACA. Although this proposed legislation ultimately failed to pass, Congress succeeded in repealing the PPACA’s individual mandate as part of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Thus, in light of the stated policies of the new U.S. presidential administration, and actions of certain members of the U.S. Congress, there is uncertainty with respect to the impact, if any, on the provisions of the PPACA affecting us. While any legislative and regulatory changes will likely take time to develop, and may or may not have an impact on the regulatory regime to which we are subject, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us.
 
Environmental Matters
 
We are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing air emissions, water and wastewater discharges, noise emissions, the use, transport, management and disposal of chemicals and hazardous materials, the import, export and registration of chemicals, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Based on information currently available to us, we do not expect environmental costs and contingencies to have a material adverse effect on us. The operation of our business and facilities, however, entails risks in these areas. Significant expenditures could be required in the future to comply with environmental or health and safety laws, regulations or requirements.
 
In Israel, where our contract manufacturer produces all of our products, businesses storing or using certain hazardous materials (including materials necessary for our manufacturing process) are required, pursuant to the Israeli Dangerous Substances Law 5753-1993, to obtain a toxin permit from the Ministry of Environmental Protection.
 
 16

 

In the European marketplace, electrical and electronic equipment is required to comply with the Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, which aims to prevent waste by encouraging reuse and recycling, and the Directive on Restriction of Use of Certain Hazardous Substances, which restricts the use of six hazardous substances in electrical and electronic products. Our products and certain components of such products “put on the market” in the EU (whether or not manufactured in the EU) are subject to these directives. Additionally, we are required to comply with certain laws, regulations and directives, including the Toxic Substances Control Act in the United States and REACH in the EU, governing chemicals. These and similar laws and regulations require the testing, reporting and registration of certain chemicals we use and ship. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
 
Manufacturing
 
ReWalk includes off-the-shelf and custom-made components produced to our specifications by various third parties, for technical and cost effectiveness. We have contracted with Sanmina Corporation (“Sanmina”), a well-established contract manufacturer with expertise in the medical device industry, for the manufacture of all of our products. Pursuant to this contract, Sanmina manufactures ReWalk at its facility in Ma’alot, Israel. All ReWalk Personal units are manufactured pursuant to the same set of specifications, and all ReWalk Rehabilitation units are manufactured pursuant to another set. We place our manufacturing orders with Sanmina pursuant to purchase orders or by providing forecasts for future requirements. We plan to use Sanmina as our manufacturer of the ReStore soft suit once it is approved by the FDA and CE. We may terminate our relationship with Sanmina at any time upon written notice. Either we or Sanmina may terminate the relationship in the event of a material breach, subject to a 30-day cure period. Our agreement with Sanmina contains a limitation on liability that applies equally to both us and Sanmina.
 
We believe that this relationship allows us to operate our business efficiently by focusing our internal efforts on the development of our technology and our products and provides us with substantial scale-up capacity. We regularly test quality on-site at Sanmina’s facility and we obtain full quality inspection reports. We maintain a non-disclosure agreement with Sanmina.
 
We develop certain of the software components internally and license other software components that are generally available for commercial use as open source software.
 
We manufacture products based upon internal sales forecasts. We deliver products to customers and distributors based upon purchase orders received, and our goal is to fulfill each customer’s order for products in regular production within two weeks of receipt of the order.
 
Suppliers
 
We have contracted with Sanmina for the sourcing of all components and raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our products. Components of our products and raw materials come from suppliers in Europe, China and Israel, and we depend on certain of these components and raw materials, including certain electronic parts, for the manufacture of our products. To date, we have not experienced significant volatility in the prices of these components and raw materials. However, such prices are subject to a number of factors, including purchase volumes, general economic conditions, currency exchange rates, industry cycles, production levels and scarcity of supply.
 
We believe that our and Sanmina’s facilities, our contracted manufacturing arrangement, and our supply arrangements are sufficient to support our potential capacity needs for the foreseeable future.

As of December 31, 2017, we had 65 employees, of whom 27 were located in the United States,26 were located in Israel and 12 are located in Germany, and as of December 31, 2016, we had 94 employees, of whom 36 were located in the United States, 41 were located in Israel and 17 were located in Germany. The majority of our employees are, and have been, engaged in sales and marketing and research and development activities. We do not employ a significant number of temporary or part time employees. The decline in total employees at the end of 2018 versus 2017 is a result of our efforts to reduce operating expenses and improve our efficiency. We will continue to evaluate spending and organizational requirements as our business develops.
