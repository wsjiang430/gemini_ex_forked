Company Overview
EVERTEC is a leading full-service transaction processing business in Latin America and the Caribbean, providing a broad range of merchant acquiring, payment services and business process management services. According to the August 2018 Nilson Report, we are one of the largest merchant acquirers in Latin America based on total number of transactions and we believe we are the largest merchant acquirer in the Caribbean and Central America. We serve 26 countries in the region from our base in Puerto Rico. We manage a system of electronic payment networks that process more than two billion transactions annually, and offer a comprehensive suite of services for core bank processing, cash processing and technology outsourcing. In addition, we own and operate the ATH network, one of the leading personal identification number (“PIN”) debit networks in Latin America. We serve a diversified customer base of leading financial institutions, merchants, corporations and government agencies with “mission-critical” technology solutions that enable them to issue, process and accept transactions securely. We believe our business is well-positioned to continue to expand across the fast-growing Latin American region. 
We are differentiated, in part, by our diversified business model, which enables us to provide our varied customer base with a broad range of transaction-processing services from a single source across numerous channels and geographic markets. We believe this capability provides several competitive advantages that will enable us to continue to penetrate our existing customer base with complementary new services, win new customers, develop new sales channels and enter new markets. We believe these competitive advantages include:

• | Our ability to provide competitive products;


• | Our ability to provide in one package a range of services that traditionally had to be sourced from different vendors;


• | Our ability to serve customers with disparate operations in several geographies with technology solutions that enable them to manage their business as one enterprise; and


• | Our ability to capture and analyze data across the transaction processing value chain and use that data to provide value-added services that are differentiated from those offered by pure-play vendors that serve only one portion of the transaction processing value chain (such as only merchant acquiring or payment services).

Our broad suite of services spans the entire transaction processing value chain and includes a range of front-end customer-facing solutions such as the electronic capture and authorization of transactions at the point-of-sale, as well as back-end support services such as the clearing and settlement of transactions and account reconciliation for card issuers. These include: (i) merchant acquiring services, which enable point of sales (“POS”) and e-commerce merchants to accept and process electronic methods of payment such as debit, credit, prepaid and electronic benefit transfer (“EBT”) cards; (ii) payment processing services, which enable financial institutions and other issuers to manage, support and facilitate the processing for credit, debit, prepaid, automated teller machines (“ATM”) and EBT card programs; and (iii) business process management solutions, which provide “mission-critical” technology solutions such as core bank processing, as well as IT outsourcing and cash management services to financial institutions, corporations and governments. We provide these services through scalable, end-to-end technology platforms that we manage and operate in-house and that generate significant operating efficiencies that enable us to maximize profitability. 
We sell and distribute our services primarily through a proprietary direct sales force with established customer relationships. We continue to pursue joint ventures and merchant acquiring alliances. We benefit from an attractive business model, the hallmarks of which are recurring revenue, scalability, significant operating margins and moderate capital expenditure 
4

requirements. Our revenue is predominantly recurring in nature because of the mission-critical and embedded nature of the services we provide. In addition, we generally negotiate multi-year contracts with our customers. We believe our business model should enable us to continue to grow our business organically in the primary markets we serve without significant incremental capital expenditures. 
Corporate Background
EVERTEC, Inc. ("EVERTEC", formerly known as Carib Latam Holdings, Inc.) is a Puerto Rico corporation organized in April 2012. Our main operating subsidiary, EVERTEC Group, LLC (formerly known as EVERTEC, LLC and EVERTEC, Inc., hereinafter “EVERTEC Group”), was organized in Puerto Rico in 1988. EVERTEC Group was formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of Popular. On September 30, 2010, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), AP Carib Holdings, Ltd. (“Apollo”), an affiliate of Apollo Global Management LLC, acquired a 51% indirect ownership interest in EVERTEC Group as part of a merger (the “Merger”) and EVERTEC Group became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings. 
On April 17, 2012, EVERTEC Group was converted from a Puerto Rico corporation to a Puerto Rico limited liability company (the “Conversion”) for the purpose of improving its consolidated tax efficiency by taking advantage of changes to the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “PR Code”), that permit limited liability companies to be treated as partnerships that are pass-through entities for Puerto Rico tax purposes. Concurrent with the Conversion, Holdings, which is our direct subsidiary, was also converted from a Puerto Rico corporation to a Puerto Rico limited liability company. Prior to these conversions, EVERTEC, Inc. was formed in order to act as the new parent company of Holdings and its subsidiaries, including EVERTEC Group. The transactions described above in this paragraph are collectively referred to as the “Reorganization.” 
History
We have over a 25 year operating history in the transaction processing industry. Prior to the Merger, EVERTEC Group was 100% owned by Popular, the largest financial institution in the Caribbean, and operated substantially as an independent entity within Popular. As mentioned above, following the Merger, Apollo owned a 51% interest in us and shortly thereafter, we began the transition to a separate, stand-alone entity. As a stand-alone company, we have made substantial investments in our technology and infrastructure, recruited various senior executives with significant transaction processing experience in Latin America, enhanced our profitability through targeted productivity and cost savings actions and broadened our footprint beyond the markets historically served. 
We continue to benefit from our relationship with Popular. Popular is our largest customer, acts as one of our largest merchant referral partners and sponsors us with the card associations (such as Visa or MasterCard), enabling merchants to accept these card associations’ credit card transactions. Popular also provides merchant sponsorship as one of the participants of the ATH network, enabling merchants to connect to the ATH network and accept ATH debit card transactions. We provide a number of critical products and services to Popular, which are governed by a 15-year Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement (the “Master Services Agreement”) that runs through 2025. 
On April 17, 2013, the Company completed its initial public offering of 28,789,943 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $20.00 per share. On September 18, 2013 and December 13, 2013, the Company completed public offerings of 23,000,000 and 15,233,273 shares, respectively, of the Company’s common stock by Apollo, Popular, and current and former employees. Popular owned approximately 11.7 million shares of EVERTEC’s common stock, or 16.1% as of December 31, 2018, and Apollo no longer owns any of the Company’s common stock. 
Principal Stockholder
Popular, Inc. (NASDAQ: BPOP), whose principal banking subsidiary’s history dates back to 1893, is the No. 1 bank holding company by both assets and deposits based in Puerto Rico, and, as of September 30, 2018, ranks 46 by assets among U.S. bank holding companies. As of December 31, 2018, Popular owned approximately 16.1% of our common stock.
Industry Trends
Shift to Electronic Payments
The ongoing migration from cash, check and other paper methods of payment to electronic payments continues to benefit the transaction processing industry globally. This migration is driven by factors including customer convenience, marketing efforts by financial institutions, card issuer rewards and the development of new forms of payment. We believe that the penetration of 
5

electronic payments in the markets where we principally operate is significantly lower relative to more mature U.S. and European markets and that this ongoing shift will continue to generate important growth opportunities for our business. In addition, in an effort to better capture taxes over generated revenue, legislation in Puerto Rico has required most licensed professionals to provide an electronic payment option to their customers, and that all consumer businesses that generate revenues in excess of $50,000 provide an electronic payment option, with the exception of certain businesses, further expanding the need for an electronic payment network in Puerto Rico.
Fast Growing Latin American and Caribbean Financial Services and Payments Markets
Currently, the penetration of banking products, including electronic payments, in the Latin American and Caribbean region is lower relative to the mature U.S. and European markets. As these markets continue to grow, and financial inclusion increases, the emergence of a larger and more sophisticated consumer base will influence and drive an increase in card (e.g., debit, credit, prepayment, and EBT) and electronic payments usage. According to the 2018 World Payments Report, non-cash payment volumes in Latin America recorded an accelerated growth rate of 16.5% in 2016, driven by financial inclusion efforts and the adoption of mobile payments and are projected to grow 21.6% through 2021, fueled by a change in mindset of payment users from cash-to-mobile payments. As economic conditions in Latin America improve, revised positive GDP forecasts may drive growth in non-cash transactions. With increasing awareness and penetration of smartphones, digital payments in Latin America might directly leapfrog into e-wallets instead of following the traditional route of increased card transactions. In North America, non-cash payments grew by 5.7% in 2016, are projected to grow 5.6% through 2021 and North America is expected to cede the position as the region with the largest number of non-cash transactions to emerging Asia by 2021. We continue to believe that the attractive characteristics of our markets and our position across multiple services and sectors will continue to drive growth and profitability in our businesses.
Ongoing Technology Outsourcing Trends
Financial institutions globally are facing significant challenges including the entrance of non-traditional competitors, the compression of margins on traditional products, significant channel proliferation and increasing regulation that could potentially curb profitability. Many of these institutions have traditionally fulfilled their IT needs through legacy computer systems, operated by the institution itself. Legacy systems are generally highly proprietary, inflexible and costly to operate and maintain and we believe the trend to outsource in-house technology systems and processes by financial institutions will continue. 
Industry Innovation
The electronic payments industry experiences ongoing technology innovation. Emerging payment technologies such as prepaid cards, contactless payments, payroll cards, mobile commerce, mobile “wallets” and innovative POS devices continue to drive the shift away from cash, check and other paper methods of payment. The increasing demand for new and flexible payment options catering to a wider range of consumer segments is driving growth in the electronic payment processing sector. 
Our Competitive Strengths
Market Leadership in Latin America and the Caribbean
We believe we have an inherent competitive advantage relative to U.S. competitors based on our first-hand knowledge of the Latin American and Caribbean markets and technological needs, language and culture. We have built leadership positions across the transaction processing value chain in the key geographic markets that we serve, which we believe will enable us to continue to penetrate our core markets and provide advantages to enter new markets. According to the August 2018 Nilson Report, we are one of the largest merchant acquirers in Latin America based on total number of transactions and we believe we are the largest merchant acquirer in the Caribbean and Central America. We own and operate the ATH network, one of the leading ATM and PIN debit networks in Latin America. EVERTEC processed approximately two billion transactions in 2018, which, according to management's estimates, makes ATH branded products the most frequently used electronic method of payment in Puerto Rico. We offer compelling value to our merchants, as noted in the most recent report published by the Federal Reserve Board regarding debit network fees, which ranked the ATH network as one of the most economical networks for merchants. Given our scale and customer base of top tier financial institutions and government entities, we believe we are the leading card issuer and core bank processor in the Caribbean and the only non-bank provider of cash processing services to the U.S. Federal Reserve in the Caribbean. We believe our competitive position and brand recognition increases card acceptance, driving usage of our proprietary network, and presents opportunities for future strategic relationships.

Broad and Deep Customer Relationships and Recurring Revenue Business Model
We have built a strong and long-standing portfolio of financial institution, merchant, corporate and government customers across Latin America and the Caribbean, which provides us with a reliable, recurring revenue base and powerful references that have helped us expand into new channels and geographic markets. Our Payment Services - Puerto Rico & Caribbean, Payment Services - Latin America and Merchant Acquiring segments, as well as certain business lines representing the majority of our business solutions segment, generate recurring revenues that collectively accounted for approximately 95% of our total revenues in 2018. We receive recurring revenues from services based on our customers’ on-going daily commercial activity such as processing loans, hosting accounts and information on our servers, and processing everyday payments at grocery stores, gas stations and similar establishments. We generally provide these services under one to five year contracts, often with automatic renewals. We also provide a few project-based services that generate non-recurring revenues in our business solutions segment such as IT consulting for a specific project or integration. Additionally, we entered into a 15-year Master Services Agreement with Popular on September 30, 2010. We provide a number of critical payment services and business solutions products and services to Popular and benefit from the bank’s distribution network and continued support. Through our long-standing and diverse customer relationships, we are able to gain valuable insight into trends in the marketplace that allows us to identify new market opportunities. In addition, we believe the recurring nature of our business model provides us with revenue and earnings stability. 
Highly Scalable, End-to-End Technology Platform
Our diversified business model is supported by our scalable, end-to-end technology platforms that allow us to provide a broad range of transaction processing services and develop and deploy technology solutions to our customers at low incremental costs and increasing operating efficiencies. We have spent over $185 million over the last five years on technology investments, including POS, to continue to build the capacity and functionality of our platforms and we have been able to achieve attractive economies of scale with flexible product development capabilities. We believe that our platforms will allow us to provide differentiated services to our customers and facilitate further expansion into new sales channels and geographic markets. 
Experienced Management Team with a Strong Track Record of Execution
We have grown our revenue organically by introducing new products and services and expanding our geographic footprint throughout Latin America. We have a proven track record of creating value from operational and technology improvements and capitalizing on cross-selling opportunities. We have combined new leadership at EVERTEC, bringing many years of industry experience, with long-standing leadership at the operating business level. Collectively, our management team benefits from an average of over 20 years of industry experience and we believe they are well positioned to continue to drive growth across business lines and regions. 
Our Growth Strategy
We intend to grow our business by continuing to execute on the following business strategies:
Continue Cross-Sales to Existing Customers
We seek to grow revenue by continuing to sell additional products and services to our existing merchant, financial institution, corporate and government customers. We intend to broaden and deepen our customer relationships by leveraging our full suite of end-to-end technology solutions. For example, we believe that there is significant opportunity to cross-sell our network services, ATM point-of-sale processing and card issuer processing services as well as our risk management products to our over 180 existing financial institution customers, particularly in markets outside of Puerto Rico. We will also seek to continue to cross-sell value added services into our existing merchant base. 
Leverage Our Franchise to Attract New Customers in the Markets We Currently Serve
We intend to attract new customers by leveraging our comprehensive product and services offering, the strength of our brand and our leading end-to-end technology platform. Furthermore, we believe we are well positioned to develop new products and services to take advantage of our access to and position in markets we currently serve. For example, in markets we serve outside of Puerto Rico, we believe there is a significant opportunity to penetrate small to medium financial institutions with our products and services.
7

Expand in the Latin American Region
We believe there is substantial opportunity to expand our businesses in the Latin American region. We believe that we have a competitive advantage relative to U.S. competitors based on our first-hand knowledge of the Latin American and Caribbean markets and their technological needs, language and culture. We believe significant growth opportunities exist in a number of large markets such as Colombia, México, and Chile, among others. We also believe that there is an opportunity to provide our services to existing financial institution customers in other regions where they operate. Additionally, we continually evaluate our strategic plans for geographic expansion, which can be achieved through joint ventures, partnerships, alliances or strategic acquisitions. For a description of risks associated with obtaining regulatory approvals and other risks associated with strategic transactions, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our expansion and selective acquisition strategy exposes us to risks, including the risk that we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses.” 
Develop New Products and Services
Our experience with our customers provides us with insight into their needs and enables us to continuously develop new transaction processing services. We plan to continue growing our merchant, financial institution, corporate and government customer base by developing and offering additional value-added products and services to cross-sell along with our core offerings. We intend to continue to focus on these and other new product opportunities in order to take advantage of our leadership position in the transaction processing industry in the Latin American and Caribbean region. 
Our Business
We offer our customers end-to-end products and solutions across the transaction processing value chain from a single source across numerous channels and geographic markets, as further described below.
Merchant Acquiring
According to the August 2018 Nilson Report, we are one of the largest merchant acquirers in Latin America based on total number of transactions and we believe we are the largest merchant acquirer in the Caribbean and Central America. Our merchant acquiring business provides services to merchants that allow them to accept electronic methods of payment such as debit, credit, prepaid and EBT cards carrying the ATH, Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express brands. Our full suite of merchant acquiring services includes, but is not limited to, the underwriting of each merchant’s contract, the deployment and rental of POS devices and other equipment necessary to capture merchant transactions, the processing of transactions at the point-of-sale, the settlement of funds with the participating financial institution, detailed sales reports and customer support. In 2018, our merchant acquiring business processed over 400 million transactions.
Payment Services 
We believe we are the largest card processor and card network service provider in the Caribbean. We provide a diversified suite of payment processing products and services to blue chip regional and global corporate customers, government agencies, and financial institutions across Latin America and the Caribbean. These services provide the infrastructure technology necessary to facilitate the processing and routing of payments across the transaction processing value chain. 
At the point-of-sale, we sell transaction processing technology solutions, similar to the services in our merchant acquiring business, to other merchant acquirers to enable them to service their own merchant customers. We also offer terminal driving solutions to merchants, merchant acquirers (including our merchant acquiring business) and financial institutions, which provide the technology to securely operate, manage and monitor POS terminals and ATMs. We also rent POS devices to financial institution customers who seek to deploy them across their own businesses. 
To connect the POS terminals to card issuers, we own and operate the ATH network, one of the leading ATM and PIN debit networks in Latin America. The ATH network connects the merchant or merchant acquirer to the card issuer and enables transactions to be routed or “switched” across the transaction processing value chain. The ATH network offers the technology, communications standards, rules and procedures, security and encryption, funds settlement and common branding that allow consumers, merchants, merchant acquirers, ATMs, card issuer processors and card issuers to conduct commerce seamlessly, across a variety of channels, similar to the services provided by Visa and MasterCard. The ATH network and processing businesses processed approximately two billion transactions in 2018.
To enable financial institutions, governments and other businesses to issue and operate a range of payment products and services, we offer an array of card processing and other payment technology services, such as internet and mobile banking 
8

software services, bill payment systems and EBT solutions. Financial institutions and certain retailers outsource to us certain card processing services such as card issuance, processing card applications, cardholder account maintenance, transaction authorization and posting, high volume payment processing fraud and risk management services, and settlement. Our payment products include electronic check processing, automated clearing house (“ACH”), lockbox, online, interactive voice response and web-based payments through personalized websites, among others. 
We have been the main provider of EBT services to the Puerto Rican government since 1998. Our EBT application allows certain agencies to deliver government benefits to participants through a magnetic card system and serves approximately 800,000 active participants. 
Business Solutions
We provide our financial institutions, corporate and government customers with a wide suite of business process management solutions including specifically core bank processing, network hosting and management, IT consulting, business process outsourcing, item and cash processing, and fulfillment. In addition, we believe we are the only non-bank provider of cash processing services to the U.S. Federal Reserve in the Caribbean. 
Competition
Competitive factors impacting the success of our services include the quality of the technology-based application or service, application features and functions, ease of delivery and integration, ability of the provider to maintain, enhance and support the applications or services, and price. We believe that we compete well in each of these categories. In addition, we believe that our relationship with Popular, scale and expertise, and financial institution industry expertise, combined with our ability to offer multiple applications, services and integrated solutions to individual customers, enhances our competitiveness against companies with more limited offerings and helps us compete with large global competitors with similar assets to ours. 
In merchant acquiring, we compete with several other service providers and financial institutions, including Worldpay, Inc., First Data Corporation, Global Payments, Inc., Elavon, Inc., EVO Payments, Inc., independent sales organizations and some local banks. Also, the card associations and payment networks are increasingly offering products and services that compete with ours. The main competitive factors are price, brand awareness, strength of the relationship with financial institutions, system functionality, integration service capabilities and innovation. Our business is also impacted by the expansion of new payments methods and devices, card association business model expansion, and bank consolidation. 
In payment services, we compete with several other third party card processors and debit networks, including First Data Corporation, Tecnocom Telecomunicaciones y Energía, S.A., Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Fiserv, Inc., Total System Services, Inc., Worldpay, Inc., MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Discover and Global Payments, Inc. Also, card associations and payment networks are increasingly offering products and services that compete with our products and services. The main competitive factors are price, system performance and reliability, system functionality, security, service capabilities and disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities. 
In business solutions, our main competition includes internal technology departments within financial institutions, retailers, data processing or software development departments of large companies and/or large technology and consulting companies, such as Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and Fiserv, Inc. The main competitive factors are price, system performance and reliability, system functionality, security, service capabilities, and disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities.
Intellectual Property
We own numerous registrations for several trademarks in different jurisdictions and own or have licenses to use certain software and technology, which are critical to our business and future success. For example, we own the ATH and EVERTEC trademarks in several jurisdictions, which are associated by the public, financial institutions and merchants with high quality and reliable electronic commerce, payments, and debit network solutions and services. Such goodwill allows us to be competitive, retain our customers and expand our business. Further, we also use a combination of (i) proprietary software, and (ii) duly licensed third party software to operate our business and deliver secure and reliable products and services to our customers. The licensed software is subject to terms and conditions that we considered within the industry standards. Most are perpetual licenses and the rest are term licenses with renewable terms. In addition, we monitor these license agreements and maintain close contact with our suppliers to ensure their continuity of service. 
9

We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by securing appropriate statutory intellectual property protection in the relevant jurisdictions. We also protect proprietary know-how and trade secrets through company confidentiality policies, licenses, programs and contractual agreements.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,100 employees across 11 countries in the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean. In Brazil, we have one unionized employee covered by the terms of industry-specific collective agreements. None of our other employees are otherwise represented by any labor organization. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good. We have not experienced any work stoppages in connection with employee matters.
Government Regulation and Payment Network Rules 
Federal Reserve Regulations 
Popular is a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company under the provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. To the extent that we are deemed to be a “subsidiary” of Popular for purposes of the Bank Holding Company (“BHC”) Act, we will be subject to regulation and oversight by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”) and our activities will be subject to several related significant restrictions, the more significant of which are discussed below. 
Transactions with Affiliates 
To the extent that we are deemed to be an affiliate of Popular for purpose of the affiliate transaction rules found in Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Board, we will be subject to various restrictions on our ability to borrow from, and engage in certain other transactions with Popular’s bank subsidiaries, Banco Popular and Banco Popular North America (“BPNA”). In general these rules require that any “covered transaction” that we enter into with Banco Popular or BPNA (or any of their respective operating subsidiaries), as the case may be, must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and must be limited to 10% of Banco Popular’s or BPNA’s, as the case may be, capital stock and surplus. In addition, all “covered transactions” between Banco Popular or BPNA, on the one hand, and Popular and all of its subsidiaries and affiliates on the other hand, must be limited to 20% of Banco Popular’s or BPNA’s, as the case may be, capital stock and surplus. “Covered transactions” are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve Board) from the affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. 
In addition, Section 23B and Regulation W require that to the extent that we are deemed an affiliate of Banco Popular or BPNA, all transactions between us and either Banco Popular or BPNA be on terms and conditions, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to Banco Popular or BPNA, as the case may be, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions involving other non-affiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and conditions, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered by Banco Popular or BPNA to, or would apply to, non-affiliated companies. 
Permissible Activities 
To the extent that we are deemed to be controlled by Popular for bank regulatory purposes, we may conduct only those activities that are authorized for a bank holding company or a financial holding company under the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation K and other relevant U.S. federal banking laws. These activities generally include activities that are related to banking, financial in nature or incidental to financial activities. In addition, restrictions placed on Popular as a result of supervisory or enforcement actions may restrict us or our activities in certain circumstances, even if these actions are unrelated to our conduct or business. To the extent that we are deemed to be a foreign subsidiary of a bank holding company under the Federal Reserve Board’s regulations, we will rely on the authority granted under the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation K to conduct our data processing, management consulting and related activities outside the United States. The Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation K generally limits activities of a bank holding company outside the United States that are not banking or financial in nature, specifically permitted under Regulation K to foreign subsidiaries or necessary to carry on such activities that are not otherwise permissible for a foreign subsidiary under the banking regulations. We continue to engage in certain activities outside the scope of such permissible activities pursuant to authority under the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation K, which allows a bank holding company to retain, in the context of an acquisition of a going concern, such 
10

otherwise impermissible activities if they account for not more than 5% of either the consolidated assets or consolidated revenues of the acquired organization.
New lines of business, other new activities, divestitures or acquisitions that we may wish to commence in the future may not be permissible for us under the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation K or other applicable U.S. federal banking laws. Further, as a result of being subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board, we may be required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before engaging in certain new activities or businesses, whether organically or by acquisition, unless such activities are considered financial in nature. If we are unable to obtain any such approval on a timely basis, are delayed in receiving approval, are approved subject to regulatory conditions or do not receive approval, this may make transactions more expensive or may make us less attractive to potential sellers.
Examinations 
As a technology service provider to financial institutions, we are also subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (the “FFIEC”), an interagency body of federal financial regulators that includes the Federal Reserve Board. The office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico also participates in such examinations by the FFIEC. In addition, independent auditors annually review several of our operations to provide reports on internal controls for our clients’ auditors and regulators. 
Regulatory Reform and Other Legislative Initiatives 
The payment card industry has come under increased scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) set forth significant structural and other changes to the regulation of the financial services industry, including the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”). The CFPB has broad supervisory, enforcement and rulemaking authority over consumer financial products and services (including many offered by us and by our clients) and certain bank and non-bank providers of such products and services. In addition, Section 1075 of the Dodd-Frank Act (commonly referred to as the “Durbin Amendment”) imposed new restrictions on card networks and debit card issuers. More specifically, the Durbin Amendment provides that the interchange transaction fees that a card issuer or payment network may receive or charge for an electronic debit transaction must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing, clearing and settling the transaction. 
The Federal Reserve’s regulations (a) limit debit transaction interchange fees to $.21 + (5 bps times the value of the transactions) + $.01 (as a fraud adjustment for issuers that have in place policies and measures to address fraud); (b) require that issuers enable at least two unaffiliated payment card networks on their debit cards without regard to authentication method; and (c) prohibit card issuers and payment card networks from entering into exclusivity arrangements for debit card processing and restrict card issuers and payment networks from inhibiting the ability of merchants to direct the routing of debit card transactions over networks of their choice. The Dodd-Frank Act also allows merchants to set minimum dollar amounts (currently, not to exceed $10) for the acceptance of a credit card and provide discounts or incentives to entice consumers to pay with various payment methods, such as cash, checks, debit cards or credit cards, as the merchant prefers.
The CFPB is responsible for many of the regulatory functions with respect to consumer financial products and services. In addition to rulemaking authority over several enumerated federal consumer financial protection laws, the CFPB is authorized to issue rules prohibiting unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offering of a consumer financial product or service or any transaction with a consumer for such product or service. The CFPB also has authority to examine supervised entities for compliance with, and to enforce violations of, consumer financial protection laws. 
To the extent that we are deemed an affiliate of Banco Popular-an insured depository institution with greater than $10 billion in total consolidated assets-and as a service provider to other insured depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets, as well as larger participants in markets for consumer financial products and services, as determined by the CFPB, we are subject to the supervision, enforcement and rulemaking authority of the CFPB. CFPB rules, examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs. 
In 2017, the former Director of the CFPB resigned and was replaced by a Director. This change in leadership, although the subject of ongoing litigation, may result in certain changes to CFPB policies and supervision, enforcement and rulemaking priorities. In addition, various legislative proposals to restructure or limit the authority of the CFPB, or to modify certain consumer financial protection laws or CFPB regulations, have been considered by Congress. It is unclear whether or to what extent any such change would affect the manner in which we engage in consumer product and service activities.

From time to time, various legislative initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, and changes in regulations or agency policies, or in the interpretation of such regulations and policies, are proposed by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to modify the powers of bank holding companies and their affiliates. Such legislation or changes in regulation could affect our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If adopted, such legislation or changes in regulation could increase the cost of doing business or limit permissible activities. We cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations or related policies and guidance, would have on our financial condition or results of operations.
Other Government Regulations 
Our services are also subject to a broad range of complex federal, state, Puerto Rico and foreign regulation, including privacy laws, international trade regulations, the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws, anti-trust and competition laws, the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the PR Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and other Puerto Rico laws and regulations. Failure of our services to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide such services, as well as the imposition of civil fines and/or criminal penalties. The principal areas of regulation (in addition to oversight by the Federal Reserve Board) that impact our business are described below. 
Privacy 
We and our financial institution clients are required to comply with various U.S. state, federal and foreign privacy laws and regulations, including those imposed under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 which applies directly to a broad range of financial institutions and to companies that provide services to financial institutions. These laws and regulations place restrictions on the collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of certain personal information, require disclosure to individuals of detailed privacy practices and provide them with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of protected information. The regulations, however, permit financial institutions to share information with non-affiliated parties who perform services for the financial institutions. These laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. Certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations, as well as, in certain circumstances, obligations to provide notification to affected individuals, states officers and consumer reporting agencies, as well as businesses and governmental agencies that own data, of security breaches of computer databases that contain personal information. In addition, U.S. state and federal government agencies have been contemplating or developing new initiatives to safeguard privacy and enhance data security. Some foreign privacy laws are stricter than those applicable under U.S. federal, state or Puerto Rican law. As a provider of services to financial institutions, we are required to comply with the privacy regulations and are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our customers as apply to the financial institutions themselves. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Security breaches or our own failure to comply with privacy regulations and industry security requirements imposed on providers of services to financial institutions and card processing services could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation.” 
Anti-Money Laundering and Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 
Since we provide data processing services to both foreign and domestic financial institutions, we are required to comply with certain anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws and economic sanctions imposed on designated foreign countries, nationals and others. Specifically, we must adhere to the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (collectively, the “BSA”) regarding processing and facilitation of financial transactions, as well as other state, local and foreign laws relating to money laundering. Furthermore, as a data processing company that provides services to foreign parties and facilitates financial transactions between foreign parties, we are obligated to screen transactions for compliance with the sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). These regulations prohibit us from entering into or facilitating a transaction to or from or dealings with specified countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals and others, such as narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations designated by the U.S. Government under one or more sanctions regimes. 
A major focus of governmental policy in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. Preventing and detecting money laundering and other related suspicious activities at their earliest stages warrants careful monitoring. The BSA, along with a number of other anti-money laundering laws, imposes various reporting and record-keeping requirements concerning currency and other types of monetary instruments. Similar anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified on lists maintained by organizations similar to OFAC in several other countries and which may impose specific data retention obligations or prohibitions on intermediaries in the payment process. These laws and regulations 
12

impose obligations to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for us. 
Federal Trade Commission Act and Other Laws Impacting our Customers' Business
All persons engaged in commerce, including, but not limited to, us and our merchant and financial institution customers are subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices (“UDAP”). In addition, there are other laws, rules and/or regulations, including the Telemarketing Sales Act, that may directly impact the activities of our merchant customers and in some cases may subject us, as the merchant's payment processor, to investigations, fees, fines and disgorgement of funds in the event we are deemed to have aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal activities of the merchant through our payment processing services. Federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies including the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and the states' attorneys general have authority to take action against nonbanks that engage in UDAP or violate other laws, rules and regulations. To the extent we process payments for a merchant that may be in violation of these laws, rules and regulations, we may be subject to enforcement actions and as a result may incur losses and liabilities that may impact our business. 
Anti-trust and Competition Laws
We are required to comply with various federal, local and foreign competition and anti-trust laws, including the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, Robinson-Patman Act, Federal Trade Commission Act and Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Act. In general, competition laws are designed to protect businesses and consumers from anti-competitive behavior. Competition and anti-trust law investigations can be lengthy and violations are subject to civil and/or criminal fines and other sanctions for both corporations and individuals that participate in the prohibited conduct. Class action civil anti-trust lawsuits can result in significant judgments, including in some cases, payment of treble damages and/or attorneys' fees to the successful plaintiff. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Failure to comply with U.S. state and federal antitrust requirements, or the Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Act, and government investigations into our compliance, could adversely affect our business.”
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), Export Administration and Other 
As a data processing company that services both foreign and domestic clients, our business activities in foreign countries, and in particular our transactions with foreign governmental entities, subject us to the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, as well as the laws and regulations of the foreign jurisdiction where we operate. Pursuant to applicable anti-bribery laws, our transactions with foreign government officials and political candidates are subject to certain limitations. Finally, in the course of business with foreign clients and subsidiaries, we export certain software and hardware that is regulated by the Export Administration Regulations from the United States to the foreign parties. Together, these regulations place restrictions on who we can transact with, what transactions may be facilitated, how we may operate in foreign jurisdictions and what we may export to foreign countries.
The preceding list of laws and regulations is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations changes continuously. The enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect directly and indirectly the operation of our business, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, litigation expense, loss of revenue, decreased profitability and/or adverse publicity.
 Association and Network Rules 
Several of our subsidiaries are registered with or certified by card associations and payment networks, including the ATH network, MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Discover and numerous debit and EBT networks as members or as service providers for member institutions in connection with the services we provide to our customers. As such, we are subject to applicable card association and network rules, which could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks for certain acts and/or omissions by us, our acquirer customers, processing customers and/or merchants. For example, “EMV” is a credit and debit card authentication methodology that the card associations are mandating to processors, issuers and acquirers in the payment industry. Compliance deadlines for EMV mandates vary by country and by payment network. We have invested significant resources and man-hours to develop and implement this methodology in all our payment related platforms. However, we are not certain if or when our financial institution customers will use or accept the methodology and the time it will take for this technology to be rolled-out to all customer ATM and POS devices connected to our platforms or adopted by our card issuing clients. Non-compliance with EMV mandates could result in lost business or 
13

financial losses from fraud or fines from network operators. We are also subject to network operating rules promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association relating to payment transactions processed by us using the Automated Clearing House Network and to various government laws regarding such operations, including laws pertaining to EBT.
