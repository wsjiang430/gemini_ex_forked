--------+---------

Overview 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, clinical development and commercialization of innovative, small molecule drugs that address underserved medical needs primarily in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders by targeting intracellular signaling mechanisms within the central nervous system, or CNS. In December 2019, CAPLYTA® (lumateperone) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults (42mg/day) and we initiated the commercial launch of CAPLYTA in March 2020. In December 2021, CAPLYTA was approved by the FDA for the treatment of bipolar depression in adults (42mg/day). We initiated the commercial launch of CAPLYTA for the treatment of bipolar depression in December 2021. Additionally, in April 2022, the FDA approved two new dosage strengths of CAPLYTA, 10.5 mg and 21 mg capsules, to provide dosage recommendations for patients concomitantly taking strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, and 21 mg for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C). We initiated the commercial launch for these special population doses in August 2022. As used in this report, “CAPLYTA” refers to lumateperone approved by the FDA for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and for the treatment of bipolar depression in adults, and “lumateperone” refers to, where applicable, CAPLYTA as well as lumateperone for the treatment of indications beyond schizophrenia and bipolar depression. Lumateperone is in Phase 3 clinical development as a novel treatment for major depressive disorder, or MDD. 
Our Product 
 In December 2019, CAPLYTA was approved by the FDA for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults (42mg/day) and we initiated the commercial launch of CAPLYTA in March 2020. In support of our commercialization efforts, we employ a national salesforce consisting of approximately 370 sales representatives. In December 2021, CAPLYTA was approved by the FDA for the treatment of bipolar depression in adults (42mg/day). CAPLYTA is the only FDA-approved treatment for depressive episodes associated with bipolar I or II disorder (bipolar depression) in adults as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. We initiated the commercial launch of CAPLYTA for the treatment of bipolar depression in December 2021. In addition, the FDA approved new dosage strengths, 10.5mg and 21mg, for special populations of patients, in April 2022. We initiated the commercial launch for these special population doses in August 2022. 
 The efficacy of CAPLYTA 42 mg in schizophrenia was demonstrated in two placebo-controlled trials, showing a statistically significant separation from placebo on the primary endpoint, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, or PANSS, total score. The most common adverse reactions (>5% and twice the rate of placebo) for the recommended dose of CAPLYTA versus placebo were somnolence/sedation (24% vs. 10%) and dry mouth (6% vs. 2%). In pooled data from short term studies, mean changes from baseline in weight gain, fasting glucose, triglycerides and total cholesterol were similar between CAPLYTA and placebo. The incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms was 6.7% for CAPLYTA and 6.3% for placebo. 
 The efficacy of CAPLYTA 42 mg in bipolar depression was demonstrated in two positive Phase 3 placebo-controlled bipolar depression studies, which evaluated the effects of CAPLYTA on depression in adult patients with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder both as monotherapy (Study 404) and as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate (Study 402). In these studies, the efficacy of CAPLYTA 42 mg was established by demonstrating 
 
3 


  statistically significant improvements over placebo for the change from baseline in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating scale, or MADRS, total score at week 6. CAPLYTA 42 mg also showed a statistically significant improvement in the key secondary endpoint relating to clinical global impression of bipolar disorder in each study. In addition, CAPLYTA demonstrated a favorable tolerability and safety profile consistent with findings in prior clinical studies in schizophrenia. The most common reported adverse reactions (occurring at a rate of 5% or more and at least twice the rate of placebo) were somnolence/sedation, dizziness, nausea, and dry mouth. Mean changes from baseline in weight, fasting glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol were similar between CAPLYTA and placebo. 
 Our Development Programs 
 Our pipeline includes several product candidates in clinical development and additional product candidates in nonclinical testing. We believe that our product candidates offer innovative therapeutic approaches and may provide advantages relative to current therapies. The following table summarizes our product candidates and programs: 
OUR THERAPEUTIC PIPELINE 
 

The safety and efficacy of investigational agents and/or investigational uses of approved products have not been established. 
 Lumateperone Development Program 
 The efficacy of lumateperone could be mediated through a combination of antagonist activity at central serotonin 5-HT2A receptors and postsynaptic antagonist activity at central dopamine D2 receptors. In terms of pharmacodynamics, lumateperone has high binding affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors and moderate binding affinity for dopamine D2 receptors, serotonin transporters, dopamine D1 receptors, dopamine D4 receptors and adrenergic alpha 1A and alpha 1B receptors. It lacks biologically relevant interactions with other receptors including muscarinic and histaminergic receptors. As a result, we believe lumateperone may represent a potential treatment across multiple therapeutic indications. 
 Lumateperone for the treatment of major depressive disorder and other mood disorders 
 As a potent 5-HT2A receptor antagonist and serotonin reuptake inhibitor, we believe that lumateperone could improve symptoms of depression with fewer side effects than currently marketed antipsychotics and 
 
4 


  antidepressants. Dopamine modulation by lumateperone may also reduce irritability and aggression that can accompany many mood disorders. Lumateperone, as a standalone agent, indirectly enhances glutamatergic neurotransmission through both AMPA and NMDA channels in the prefrontal cortex via lumateperone’s dopamine D1 receptor activation. By enhancing AMPA neurotransmission, lumateperone also activates key proteins in the mTOR pathway which has shown antidepressant effects. As such, lumateperone may represent a potential treatment for mood disorders including MDD and post-traumatic stress disorder. 
 Lumateperone is in Phase 3 clinical development as a novel treatment for MDD. Patient enrollment in Study 501 and Study 502, global Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating lumateperone 42 mg as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of MDD, is ongoing. In addition, in the second quarter of 2023, we expect to initiate a third global Phase 3 trial, Study 505, also evaluating lumateperone 42 mg as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of MDD. Study 505 is intended to serve as a potential additional registration trial in support of a supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, for approval of lumateperone as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of MDD, if needed. This is a common strategy employed in mood disorder development programs. Subject to the results of Study 501 and Study 502, we expect to file an sNDA with the FDA for approval of lumateperone as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of MDD in 2024. In the first quarter of 2020, as part of our lumateperone bipolar depression clinical program, we initiated our third monotherapy Phase 3 study, Study 403, evaluating lumateperone as monotherapy in the treatment of major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. Following the positive results in our adjunctive study that was part of our bipolar depression clinical program, Study 402, we amended Study 403 to evaluate major depressive episodes with mixed features in bipolar disorder in patients with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder and mixed features in patients with MDD. Clinical conduct for Study 403 has been completed, and we expect to report topline results in the first quarter of 2023. Following reporting of topline results, we intend to discuss the results with the FDA to determine whether this study will provide supportive data for a potential future regulatory filing for this indication. 
 We have also initiated a Phase 3 study evaluating lumateperone for the prevention of relapse in patients with schizophrenia. The study is being conducted in five phases consisting of a screening phase, a 6-week, open-label run-in phase during which all patients will receive 42 mg of lumateperone per day, a 12-week, open-label stabilization phase during which all patients will receive 42 mg of lumateperone per day; a double-blind treatment phase, 26 weeks in duration, during which patients receive either 42 mg of lumateperone per day or placebo (1:1 ratio) and a 2-week safety follow-up phase. This study is being conducted in accordance with our post approval marketing commitment to the FDA in connection with the approval of CAPLYTA for the treatment of schizophrenia as is typical for antipsychotics. 
 Other Indications for Lumateperone 
 Within the lumateperone portfolio, we are also developing a long-acting injectable, or LAI, formulation to provide more treatment options to patients suffering from mental illness. We have completed the nonclinical development of an LAI formulation, and we have conducted a Phase 1 single ascending dose study with this formulation. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of lumateperone LAI in patients with stable symptoms of schizophrenia. We completed this study and it was safe and well tolerated. We are evaluating several additional formulations of the lumateperone LAI with treatment durations of one month and longer. Non-clinical development on these additional formulations is ongoing and expected to be completed in 2023 and we plan to initiate Phase I single ascending dose studies with these formulations in 2023. Given the encouraging tolerability data to date with oral lumateperone, we believe that an LAI option, in particular, may lend itself to being an important formulation choice for certain patients. 
 We hold exclusive, worldwide commercialization rights to lumateperone and a family of compounds from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company pursuant to an exclusive license.

 Other Product Candidates 
 We are developing ITI-1284-ODT-SL for the treatment of agitation in patients with dementia, the treatment of dementia-related psychosis and the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. ITI-1284-ODT-SL is a deuterated form of lumateperone, a new molecular entity formulated as an oral disintegrating tablet for sublingual administration. ITI-1284-ODT-SL is formulated as an oral solid dosage form that dissolves almost instantly when placed under the tongue, allowing for ease of use in the elderly and may be particularly beneficial for patients who have difficulty swallowing conventional tablets. Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose studies in healthy volunteers and healthy elderly volunteers (> than 65 years of age) evaluated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ITI-1284-ODT-SL. In these studies, there were no reported serious adverse events in either age group. In the elderly cohort, reported adverse events were infrequent with the most common adverse event being transient dry mouth (mild). Based on these results, we have initiated our program evaluating ITI-1284-ODT-SL for the treatment of agitation in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. We are in discussions with the FDA regarding the nonclinical toxicological profile of ITI-1284-ODT-SL. The FDA has informed us that they do not believe the deuterated and undeuterated forms of lumateperone are identical. As a result, the nonclinical data from lumateperone may not be broadly applied to ITI-1284-ODT-SL and we are conducting additional toxicology studies. We expect to commence clinical conduct in a Phase 2 study in agitation in patients with Alzheimer’s disease in 2023. Additional studies in psychosis in patients with Alzheimer’s disease and generalized anxiety disorder are also planned for 2023. We are continuing with Phase 1 studies with ITI-1284-ODT-SL, including drug-drug interaction studies. 
 We have another major program that has yielded a portfolio of compounds that selectively inhibit the enzyme phosphodiesterase type 1, or PDE1. PDE1 enzymes are highly active in multiple disease states and our PDE1 inhibitors are designed to reestablish normal function in these disease states. Abnormal PDE1 activity is associated with cellular proliferation and activation of inflammatory cells. Our PDE1 inhibitors ameliorate both of these effects in animal models. We intend to pursue the development of our phosphodiesterase, or PDE, program, for the treatment of aberrant immune system activation in several CNS and non-CNS conditions with a focus on diseases where excessive PDE1 activity has been demonstrated and increased inflammation is an important contributor to disease pathogenesis. Our potential disease targets include immune system regulation, neurodegenerative diseases, cancers and other non-CNS disorders. Lenrispodun (ITI-214) is our lead compound in this program. Following the favorable safety and tolerability results in our Phase 1 program, we initiated our development program for lenrispodun for Parkinson’s disease and conducted a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of lenrispodun in patients with Parkinson’s disease to evaluate safety and tolerability in this patient population, as well as motor and non-motor exploratory endpoints. In this study, lenrispodun was generally well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile and clinical signs consistent with improvements in motor symptoms and dyskinesias. We have initiated our Phase 2 clinical program with lenrispodun for Parkinson’s disease, and expect to commence patient enrollment in the first quarter of 2023. We also have an active Investigational New Drug application to evaluate our newest candidate within the PDE 1 inhibitor program, ITI-1020, as a novel cancer immunotherapy. A Phase 1 program with ITI-1020 in healthy volunteers is anticipated to commence in the first half of 2023. 
 We also have a development program with our ITI-333 compound as a potential treatment for substance use disorders and pain. There is a pressing need to develop new drugs to treat opioid addiction and safe, effective, non-addictive treatments to manage pain. ITI-333 is a novel compound that uniquely combines activity as an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors and a partial agonist at µ-opioid receptors. These combined actions support the potential utility of ITI-333 in the treatment of opioid use disorder and associated comorbidities (e.g., depression, anxiety, sleep disorders) without opioid-like safety and tolerability concerns. We have conducted a Phase 1 single ascending dose study evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ITI-333 in healthy volunteers. In this study, ITI-333 achieved plasma exposures at or above those required for efficacy and was generally safe and well-tolerated. We have commenced a neuroimaging study to investigate brain occupancy for receptors that play a role in substance use disorder and also have applicability for pain. The results of this study will support the dose selection for future studies. We commenced a multiple ascending dose study in the first quarter of 2023. We have received a grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse under the 
 
6 


  Helping to End Addiction Long-term Initiative, or NIH HEAL Initiative, that we expect will fund a significant portion of the early stage clinical development costs associated with this program. 
 Our Drug Discovery Platform and Capabilities 
 Based on the pioneering efforts of our late co-founder and Nobel laureate, Dr. Paul Greengard, we have developed a detailed understanding of intracellular signaling pathways and intracellular targets. We have used that knowledge to develop several state of the art technology platforms, including one called CNSProfileTM. This technology monitors the phosphoprotein changes elicited by major psychotropic drug classes and subclasses, and generates a unique molecular signature for drug compounds. By monitoring how the levels of these phosphoproteins change in vivo, we identify intracellular signaling pathways through which several major drug classes operate. Along with what we believe to be state of the art drug discovery efforts, we have used, and may continue to use, this information as a tool to validate our selection of nonclinical candidate molecules. 
 Given the nature of our research and development and business activities, we do not expect that compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws will result in material costs or have a significant negative effect on our operations. 
 Disease and Market Overview 
 Our programs for small molecule therapeutics are designed to address various CNS and other diseases that we believe are underserved or unmet by currently available therapies and that represent large potential commercial market opportunities for us. Background information on the diseases and related commercial markets that may be addressed by our programs is set forth below. 
Schizophrenia 
 Schizophrenia is a disabling and chronic mental illness that is characterized by multiple symptoms during an acute phase of the disorder that can include so-called “positive” symptoms, such as hallucinations, hearing voices, grandiose beliefs and suspiciousness or paranoia. These symptoms can be accompanied by additional, harder to treat symptoms, such as social withdrawal, blunted emotional response and speech deficits, collectively referred to as “negative” symptoms, difficulty concentrating and disorganized thoughts, or cognitive impairment, depression and insomnia. Such residual symptoms often persist even after the acute positive symptoms subside, and contribute substantially to the social and employment disability associated with schizophrenia. 
 According to the American Psychiatric Association and the National Institute of Mental Health, about 1% of the population (2.4 million adults in the United States) suffers from schizophrenia in any given year. A landmark study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness, also referred to as CATIE, which was published in The New England Journal of Medicine in September 2005, found that 74% of patients taking typical or atypical antipsychotics discontinued treatment within 18 months because of side effects or lack of efficacy. 
 Bipolar Disorder 
 Bipolar disorder, sometimes referred to as manic-depressive illness, is characterized by extreme shifts in mood. Individuals with bipolar disorder may experience intense feelings of over-excitement, irritability, impulsivity with grandiose beliefs and racing thoughts, referred to as a manic episode. Symptoms of depression may include feeling tired, hopeless and sad, with difficulty concentrating and thoughts of suicide. Some people experience both types of symptoms in the same “mixed” episode. Severe symptoms of bipolar disorder can be associated with hallucinations or delusions, otherwise referred to as psychosis.

 According to the National Institute of Mental Health, an estimated 4.4% of adults in the United States (approximately 11 million adults in the United States) experience bipolar disorder at some time in their lives. Bipolar disorder is often treated with antipsychotic medications alone or in combination with mood stabilizers. The side effects and safety risks associated with antipsychotic drugs in patients with bipolar disorder are similar to those experienced by patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, a large national research program conducted from 1998 to 2005 called the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder, or STEP-BD, followed 4,360 patients with bipolar disorder long term and showed that about half of patients who were treated for bipolar disorder, still experienced lingering and recurrent symptoms, indicating a clear need for improved treatments. 
 Major Depressive Disorder 
 MDD is a mood disorder that can be associated with symptoms of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, feelings of guilt, irritability, loss of interest in formerly pleasurable activities, cognitive impairment, disturbed sleep patterns, and suicide ideation or behavior. Different people may experience different symptoms, but everyone with major depression experiences symptoms that are severe enough to interfere with everyday functioning, such as the ability to concentrate at work or school, social interactions, eating and sleeping. Sometimes the depressive episode can be so severe it is accompanied by psychosis (hallucinations and delusions). 
 According to the National Institute of Mental Health, approximately 8.4% of adults in the United States experience MDD each year. The antidepressant market is primarily composed of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as escitalopram and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs, such as duloxetine. Antipsychotics such as quetiapine, aripriprazole, Rexulti® and Vraylar® are also used as adjunctive treatments with antidepressant treatment. The National Institute of Mental Health-funded Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression, or STAR*D, study showed that only one-third of treated patients experience complete remission of depressive symptoms. Nearly two-thirds of patients with depression do not fully recover on an anti-depressant medication. 
 Behavioral Disturbances in Dementia 
 The World Health Organization estimates that approximately 55 million people worldwide have dementia, and there are nearly 10 million new cases every year. The Alzheimer’s Association estimates more than 6 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s dementia, or AD, in 2022. While the diagnostic criteria for AD and other dementias mostly focus on the related cognitive deficits, it is often the behavioral and psychiatric symptoms that are most troublesome for caregivers and lead to poor quality of life for patients. Several behavioral symptoms are quite prevalent in patients with dementia, including patients with AD. We believe that ITI-1284 may provide a novel therapy for treating the behavioral disturbances accompanying dementia, including AD. 
 The FDA has not approved any drug to treat the behavioral symptoms of dementia, including AD. We believe there is a large unmet medical need for a safe and effective therapy to treat the behavioral symptoms in patients with dementia, including AD. 
 Parkinson’s Disease 
 Parkinson’s disease is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder that involves malfunction and death of neurons in a region of the brain that controls movement. This neurodegeneration creates a shortage of an important brain signaling chemical, or neurotransmitter, known as dopamine, thereby rendering patients unable to direct or control their movements in a normal manner. Parkinson’s disease is characterized by well-known motor symptoms, including tremors, limb stiffness, slowness of movements, and difficulties with posture and balance, as well as by non-motor symptoms, which include sleep disturbances, mood disorders, cognitive 
 
8 


  impairment and psychosis. Parkinson’s disease progresses slowly in most people and the severity of symptoms tends to worsen over time. 
 According to the National Parkinson Foundation, about 1 million people in the United States and more than 10 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. Parkinson’s disease is more common in people over 60 years of age, and the prevalence of this disease is expected to increase significantly as the average age of the population increases. Parkinson’s disease patients are commonly treated with dopamine replacement therapies, such as levodopa, commonly referred to as L-DOPA, which is metabolized to dopamine, and dopamine agonists, which are molecules that mimic the action of dopamine. Global Data estimated global sales of therapeutics such as L-DOPA, and dopamine agonists used to treat the disease to be approximately $4.3 billion in 2022. 
 Non-motor symptoms can be particularly distressing and even more troublesome to patients with Parkinson’s disease than the primary motor disturbances. Non-motor symptoms substantially contribute to the burden of Parkinson’s disease and deeply affect the quality of life of patients and their caregivers. Non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease are associated with increased caregiver stress and burden, nursing home placement, and increased morbidity and mortality. Treatment of non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease poses a challenge to physicians. Current dopamine replacement drugs used to treat the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease do not help, and sometimes worsen, the non-motor symptoms. We believe there is a large unmet medical need for the treatment of non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease. 
 Opioid Use Disorder 
 The opioid crisis was declared a public health emergency in 2017. According to the 2019 CDC annual surveillance report of drug-related risks and outcomes, opioid misuse is widespread with over 10 million Americans reporting opioid misuse. The rate of drug overdose deaths involving opioids in the United States remains high, with more than 68,000 deaths reported in 2020. 
 Opioids are a class of drugs that include the illegal drug heroin, synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, and pain relievers available legally by prescription, including oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine and morphine. Opioids produce high levels of positive reinforcement, increasing the odds that people will continue using them despite negative consequences. Opioid use disorder is a chronic lifelong disorder, with serious potential consequences including disability, relapses, and death. While medications including methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone are approved to treat opioid use disorder, these medications do not effectively treat psychiatric comorbidities (e.g., mood and anxiety disorders) that may drive opioid use/abuse or dysphoria or the dysphoria and mood disturbances (e.g., depression and anxiety) that often accompany opioid withdrawal and abstinence. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to discover, develop and commercialize novel small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of CNS diseases and other diseases in order to improve the lives of people suffering from such illnesses. Using our key understanding of intracellular signaling, we seek to accomplish our goal, using our in-house expert drug discovery and clinical development teams, in two ways: 
 

• | we seek to have the capability to develop first-in-class medications with novel mechanisms that have the potential to treat CNS diseases and other diseases for which there are no previously marketed drugs; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we seek to develop drugs that either can differentiate themselves in competitive markets by addressing aspects of CNS diseases and other diseases which are not adequately treated by currently marketed drugs or can be effective with fewer side effects.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The key elements of our strategy are to:

** | We have filed patent term extension applications on two U.S. patents. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, has not completed its review of these applications. In the United States, we are permitted to extend the term of one U.S. patent for lumateperone or the use thereof. Accordingly, on completion of the USPTO’s review of our patent term extension applications, we must select one of the two patents to which any patent term extension granted will attach. Patent terms may be subject to change not only due to potential patent term extensions but also to any terminal disclaimer that reduces patent term, as well as other factors. Because the U.S. patent laws and related judicial interpretations change, modifications or new interpretations of the laws may impact our patent terms.

 Our ITI-1284 program relates to novel lumateperone derivatives for the treatment of behavioral disturbances associated with dementia, and other central nervous system disorders. Six families of patent applications have been filed, which have already resulted in eight U.S. patents and fifteen foreign patents. The ITI-1284 molecule has composition of matter protection to 2037, with possible extensions and additional Orange Book-listable protection to 2042. 
 Our program on PDE1 inhibitors for cognition, dopamine-mediated and other disorders, cardiovascular disorders, as well as several others, includes patent protection across 55 families, including 31 families for the lead molecule, lenrispodun, as well as a wide range of filings on other proprietary compounds and indications. The lenrispodun lead molecule has composition of matter protection to 2029, with possible extensions and additional Orange Book-listable protection to 2034. Additionally, we expect to have data exclusivity in the European Union (EU) for up to 11 years from commercial launch. We have obtained patent coverage for lenrispodun in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, including heart failure, that extends to 2034. We are also evaluating potential follow-on compounds for lenrispodun which would have patent protection beyond 2030. 
 Our ITI-333 program relates to novel compounds for the non-addictive treatment of pain and for the treatment of opiate use disorder. 18 families of patent applications have been filed, including five families which have already resulted in six U.S. patents and three EP grants, as well as thirteen other foreign grants. These patent families will protect the lead compound, as well as many other analogs under development, beyond 2037 (exclusive of any patent term extensions and regulatory exclusivities).

 We have also filed patent applications on novel proprietary targets and lead compounds for AD, which would provide compound protection beyond 2028 or beyond 2034, depending on which compound is ultimately selected for development. 
 License Agreement 
 The Bristol-Myers Squibb License Agreement 
 On May 31, 2005, we entered into a worldwide, exclusive License Agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, pursuant to which we hold a license to certain patents and know-how of BMS relating to lumateperone and other specified compounds. The agreement was amended on November 3, 2010. The licensed rights are exclusive, except BMS retains rights in specified compounds in the fields of obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. However, BMS has no right to use, develop or commercialize lumateperone and other specified compounds in any field of use. We have the right to grant sublicenses of the rights conveyed by BMS. We are obliged under the license to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the licensed technology. We are also prohibited from engaging in the clinical development or commercialization of specified competitive compounds. 
 Under the agreement, we made an upfront payment of $1.0 million to BMS, a milestone payment of $1.25 million in December 2013, and a milestone payment of $1.5 million in December 2014 following the initiation of our first Phase 3 clinical trial for lumateperone for patients with schizophrenia. Upon FDA acceptance of a New Drug Application, or NDA, filing for lumateperone, we were obligated to pay BMS a $2.0 million milestone payment. The FDA accepted our NDA filing for lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia in the third quarter of 2018 and, as a result, we paid the milestone payment in the first quarter of 2019. The FDA approved our NDA filing on December 23, 2019 and as a result, we accrued $5.0 million related to that milestone in the fourth quarter of 2019 which was paid in the first quarter of 2020. Remaining potential milestone payments under the agreement with respect to lumateperone total $5.0 million if approvals to market the product are received in certain countries outside the U.S. Under the agreement, we may be obliged to make other milestone payments to BMS, for licensed products other than lumateperone, of up to an aggregate of approximately $14.75 million. We are also obliged to make tiered single digit percentage royalty payments ranging between 5 – 9% on sales of licensed products. We are obliged to pay to BMS a percentage of non-royalty payments made in consideration of any sublicense. 
 The agreement extends, and royalties are payable, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, through the later of ten years after first commercial sale of a licensed product in such country, expiration of the last licensed patent covering a licensed product, its method of manufacture or use, or the expiration of other government grants providing market exclusivity, subject to certain rights of the parties to terminate the agreement on the occurrence of certain events. On termination of the agreement, we may be obliged to convey to BMS rights in developments relating to a licensed compound or licensed product, including regulatory filings, research results and other intellectual property rights. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of CAPLYTA or any of our product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently rely on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials inclusive of active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and its intermediates, as well as finished product for commercial sales of CAPLYTA and for ournonclinical research and clinical trials, including our ongoing and anticipated trials. We believe that we would be able to contract with other third-party contract manufacturers to obtain active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, if our existing sources of API were no longer available, but there is no assurance that API would be available from other third-party manufacturers on acceptable terms, on the timeframe that our business would require, or at all.

 The Siegfried Supply Agreement 
 On January 4, 2017, we entered into a supply agreement with Siegfried Evionnaz SA, an affiliate of Siegfried AG, or Siegfried. Following the automatic expiration of the agreement on January 4, 2023, we entered into a new supply agreement with Siegfried effective January 5, 2023, or the Siegfried Agreement. Under the Siegfried Agreement, Siegfried has agreed to manufacture and supply the API for lumateperone in commercial quantities. We agreed to provide Siegfried with a rolling forecast of our anticipated requirements for supply of the API. Under the agreement, our purchase prices for supply of the API from Siegfried are specified prices based on the volume of API produced. The initial term of the Siegfried Agreement is three years until January 5, 2026. The Siegfried Agreement will automatically renew on an evergreen basis for a consecutive one-year period, unless either party notifies the other party of its election to not renew the agreement at least 12 months prior to the end of the initial term or any renewal period then in effect. Either party may terminate the agreement prior to its expiration upon an uncured material breach by the other party, the liquidation or dissolution of the other party, the commencement of insolvency procedures or other bankruptcy-related proceedings that are not dismissed within a certain period of time, the appointment of any receiver, trustee or assignee to take possession of the properties of the other party, the cessation of all or substantially all of the other party’s business operations, or a continuing force majeure event affecting the other party. Under the Siegfried Agreement, we have the right to and may purchase the API for lumateperone from other suppliers. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has committed to purchasing production campaigns of API and intermediate product from Siegfried that are expected to be delivered in 2023 and 2024. 
The Lonza Manufacturing Services Agreement 
 On January 10, 2017, we entered into a manufacturing services agreement, as amended on December 19, 2022, or the Lonza Agreement, with Lonza Ltd., or Lonza. Under the Lonza Agreement, Lonza has agreed to manufacture and supply the API for lumateperone, with purchase prices specified based on the volume produced. We agreed to provide Lonza with a written forecast of our estimated quarterly requirements. On December 19, 2022, the Lonza Agreement was amended to, among other items, extend the current term of the agreement until December 31, 2028 and provide for certain minimum annual purchase commitments by the Company for the years 2025 through 2028 for delivery in 2026 through 2029. Either party may terminate the agreement prior to its expiration upon a prior written notice, an uncured material breach by the other party, the insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or bankruptcy of the other party, or a continuing force majeure event affecting the other party, and may be extended by mutual consent. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has committed to purchasing production campaigns of API and intermediate products from Lonza that are expected to be delivered in 2023 and 2024. 
 Development and commercial quantities of any products that we develop will need to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with the requirements of the FDA and the regulatory agencies of other jurisdictions in which we are seeking approval. We currently employ internal resources to manage our manufacturing contractors. 
 Commercial Operations 
 We initiated the commercial launch of CAPLYTA for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults in the United States in March 2020. In December 2021 we launched CAPLYTA for the treatment of bipolar depression in adults. In support of our commercialization efforts we employ a national sales force consisting of approximately 370 sales representatives. In the future, we may choose to commercialize CAPLYTA or any other products, in markets outside of the United States, if approved for sale in such markets, by establishing one or more strategic alliances. 
 
13 


 Customers 
 We are currently approved to sell CAPLYTA for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and for the treatment of bipolar depression in adults in the U.S. CAPLYTA is priced in line with other currently marketed branded antipsychotics indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and for the treatment of bipolar depression. We distribute CAPLYTA principally through three third-party wholesale drug distributors whose concentration are each between 28% and 39% of total sales. 
Competition 
 We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as numerous academic and research institutions and governmental agencies, both in the United States and abroad. We compete, or will compete, with existing and new products being developed by our competitors. Some of these competitors are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that our research and development programs target. 
 Even if we are successful in commercializing CAPLYTA and developing and obtaining approval of our product candidates, we would compete with a variety of established drugs in the areas of our targeted CNS therapeutic indications. CAPLYTA for the treatment of schizophrenia and for the treatment of bipolar depression competes with, among other branded products, Fanapt®, marketed by Vanda Pharmaceuticals, Lybalvi®, marketed by Alkermes, Rexulti®, marketed by Otsuka Pharmaceutical, and Vraylar®, marketed by AbbVie. In addition, CAPLYTA competes and our product candidates, if approved, would compete with, among other generic antipsychotic products, aripiprazole, clozapine, haloperidol, lurasidone, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine/XR and risperidone. 
 In addition, the companies described above and other competitors may have a variety of drugs in development or be awaiting FDA approval that could reach the market and become established before our approved product is established in the market or before we are able to sell our product candidates, if approved. Our competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could further limit the market for any drugs that we may develop. Many of our competitors are using technologies or methods different or similar to ours to identify and validate drug targets and to discover novel small molecule drugs. Many of our competitors and their collaborators have significantly greater experience than we do in the following: 
 

• | identifying and validating targets;
--+------------------------------------


• | screening compounds against targets;
--+-------------------------------------


• | nonclinical studies and clinical trials of potential pharmaceutical products; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtaining FDA and other regulatory clearances.
--+-----------------------------------------------

 In addition, many of our competitors and their collaborators have substantially greater advantages in the following areas: 
 

• | capital resources;
--+-------------------


• | research and development resources;
--+------------------------------------


• | manufacturing capabilities; and
--+--------------------------------


• | sales and marketing.
--+---------------------

 Smaller companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through proprietary research discoveries and collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. Many of our competitors have products that have been approved by the FDA or are in advanced development. We face competition from other companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, 
 
14 


  in recruiting and retaining highly qualified commercial, scientific and management personnel and for licenses to additional technologies. Our competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, may succeed in developing technologies or drugs that are more effective, safer, and more affordable or more easily administered than ours and may achieve patent protection or commercialize drugs sooner than us. Developments by others may render our product candidates or our technologies obsolete. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Government Regulation 
 United States—FDA Process 
 The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, import and export, distribution and marketing, among other things, prescription of drug products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, clinical holds, warning letters, fines, civil penalties, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution. 
 Drug Approval Process. None of our drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States until the drug has received FDA approval. Such approval can take many years to obtain and may be rejected by the FDA at a number of steps. The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally include the following: 

• | completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, potentially animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the API and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of FDA inspections of clinical trial sites to assure that data supporting the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate has been generated in compliance with Good Clinical Practices; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023, signed into law on December 29, 2022, (P.L. 117-328) amended the FDCA to specify that nonclinical testing for drugs may, but is not required to, include in vivo animal testing. According to the amended language, a sponsor may fulfill nonclinical testing requirements by completing various in vitro assays (e.g., cell-based assays, organ chips, or microphysiological systems), in silico studies (i.e., computer modeling), other human or non-human biology-based tests (e.g., bioprinting), or in vivo animal tests. The conduct of the nonclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, 
 
15 


  unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial, such as whether human research subjects will be exposed to an unreasonable health risk. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. The FDA, the trial’s sponsor or an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, overseeing the trial also may place a study on hold at any time during its execution. 
 Clinical trials involve administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be provided to the FDA as part of a separate submission to the IND. Further, an IRB, for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial, must review and approve the study protocol and informed consent information for study subjects for any clinical trial before it commences at that center, and the IRB must monitor the study until it is completed. There are also requirements governing reporting of on-going clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. Failure to timely register a covered clinical study or to submit study results as provided for in the law can give rise to civil monetary penalties and also prevent the non-compliant party from receiving future grant funds from the federal government. The ClinicalTrials.gov registration and reporting final rule became effective in 2017, and the government has begun enforcing those requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors. Study subjects must provide informed consent before being enrolled to participate in a clinical trial. 
 Clinical trials necessary for product approval typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. 
 

• | Phase 1 usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational drug into a limited population, typically healthy humans, to evaluate its short-term safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic actions, and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to (i) evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; (ii) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks; and (iii) evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 trials, commonly referred to as pivotal studies, are undertaken in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial centers to further evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety by using the drug in its final form.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA may approve an NDA for a product candidate, but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug after NDA approval under a post-approval commitment. Post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. 
 Congress also recently amended the FDCA, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023, in order to require sponsors of a Phase 3 clinical trial, or other “pivotal study” of a new drug to support marketing authorization, to design and submit a diversity action plan for such clinical trial. The action plan must include the sponsor’s diversity goals for enrollment, as well as a rationale for the goals and a description of how the sponsor will meet them. Sponsors must submit a diversity action plan to the FDA by the time the sponsor submits the relevant clinical trial protocol to the agency for review. The FDA may grant a waiver for some or all of the requirements for a diversity action plan. It is unknown at this time how the diversity action plan may affect Phase 3 trial planning and timing or what specific information FDA will expect in such plans, but if the FDA objects to a sponsor’s diversity action plan, it may delay trial initiation. 
 
16 


 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given an opportunity to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach an agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug. A sponsor may request a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, to reach an agreement with the FDA that the protocol design, clinical endpoints, and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness in the indication studied. If such an agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the administrative record, and it will be binding on the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the product after clinical studies begin, or if the sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA. There is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the study is subject to an SPA. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final drugs. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of nonclinical studies and of clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee. These fees are typically adjusted annually, but exemptions and waivers may be available under certain circumstances. The NDA is subject to a sixty-day acceptance period, and if sufficiently complete to permit substantive review, will be filed by the FDA at the end of that period. For NDAs that are assigned a standard review designation, the FDA’s goal is to complete its review ten months from the date the FDA files the NDA and, for NDA determined by the agency to be eligible for priority review, six months from the date the FDA files the NDA. These goals can be extended by the FDA through requests for additional information from the sponsor. 
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. The FDA will review the NDA to determine, among other things, whether product candidate is safe and effective for its intended use. FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. The FDA may also refer the application to the appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA inspects the facility or the facilities at which the drug and/or its active pharmaceutical ingredient is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing is in compliance with cGMPs. On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. The approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy, or impose other conditions, as discussed further below. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its current form. A Complete Response Letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may 
 
17 


  require additional clinical data and/or additional clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may choose to either resubmit the NDA addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter or withdraw the application. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials is not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data. Alternatively, the FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to mitigate risks of the drug, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. Once the FDA approves a drug, the FDA may withdraw product approval if on-going regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs or other information. 
 Post-Approval Requirements. After a drug has been approved by the FDA for sale, the FDA may require that certain post-approval requirements be satisfied, including the conduct of additional clinical trials. If post-approval conditions are not satisfied, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. In addition, certain changes to an approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes, or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Before a company can market products for additional indications, it must obtain additional approvals from the FDA, typically through the submission and approval of a supplemental NDA. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical trials be conducted. A company cannot be sure that any additional approval for new indications for any product candidate will be approved on a timely basis, or at all. 
 In addition, holders of an approved NDA are required to (i) report certain adverse reactions to the FDA and maintain pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events; (ii) comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products; and (iii) continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMPs after approval. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and the approved drug’s manufacturing facilities, which includes assessment of on-going compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. We intend to continue to use third-party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical and commercial quantities, and future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in new restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including recall of the product from the market, imposition of a REMS program, or withdrawal of approval of the NDA for that drug, among other potential consequences. 
 Moreover, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription drug product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. Most recently, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, was enacted with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a ten-year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023. From time to time, new legislation and regulations may be implemented that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.

 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the extension must be requested prior to expiration of the patent. Also, the approval must be the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the active ingredient under the relevant provision of law. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. We have applied for, and in the future we intend to apply for, restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA. 
 Data and market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the data and information associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct, or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. The FDCA also provides seven years of market exclusivity for a drug designated for a rare disease or condition (e.g., a disease or condition that affects less than 200,000 people in the United States) that begins to run after the drug’s marketing approval for that condition. The exclusivity prohibits the approval of the same drug for the same disease or condition unless there is a showing of clinical superiority or other exceptions are triggered. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we may become subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials and approval of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
Pricing and Reimbursement 
 In the United States and internationally, sales of any approved products, and our ability to generate revenues on such sales, are dependent, in significant part, on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement 
 
19 


  from third-party payors, such as state and federal governments, managed care providers and private insurance plans. Private insurers, such as health maintenance organizations and managed care providers, have implemented cost-cutting and reimbursement initiatives and likely will continue to do so in the future. These include establishing formularies that govern the drugs and biologics that will be offered and the out-of-pocket obligations of member patients for such products. We may need to conduct pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products for formulary coverage and reimbursement. Even with such studies, our products may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than existing products, and third-party payors may not provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, in whole or in part. 
 In addition, particularly in the United States and increasingly in other countries, we are required to provide discounts and pay rebates to state and federal governments and agencies in connection with purchases of our products that are reimbursed by such entities. It is possible that future legislation in the United States and other jurisdictions could be enacted to potentially impact reimbursement rates for the products we are developing and may develop in the future and could further impact the levels of discounts and rebates paid to federal and state government entities. Any legislation that impacts these areas could impact, in a significant way, our ability to generate revenues from sales of any approved product that we bring to market. Most recently, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into the law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA. Among other things, the IRA has multiple provisions that may impact the prices of drug products that are both sold into the Medicare program and throughout the United States. Starting in 2023, a manufacturer of drugs or biological products covered by Medicare Parts B or D must pay a rebate to the federal government if their drug product’s price increases faster than the rate of inflation. This calculation is made on a drug product by drug product basis and the amount of the rebate owed to the federal government is directly dependent on the volume of a drug product that is paid for by Medicare Parts B or D. Additionally, starting for payment year 2026, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will negotiate drug prices annually for a select number of single source Part D drugs without generic or biosimilar competition. CMS will also negotiate drug prices for a select number of Part B drugs starting for payment year 2028. If a drug product is selected by CMS for negotiation, it is expected that the revenue generated from such drug will decrease. CMS has begun to implement these new authorities but their impact on the pharmaceutical industry in the United States remains uncertain. In addition to the IRA’s drug price negotiation provisions, President Biden’s Executive Order 14087, issued in October 2022, called for CMS to prepare and submit a report to the White House on potential payment and delivery modes that would complement to IRA, lower drug costs, and promote access to innovative drugs. As of mid-January 2023, the report had not been released but it is expected to further inform the current Administration’s priorities and activities in this area. 
 Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry in the United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could significantly affect our future business. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, enacted in March 2010, substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Certain legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the ACA have occurred over the past few years and further legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible. We expect that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that may be charged for any of our product candidates, if approved. Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that federal law does not preempt the states’ ability to regulate pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) and other members of the health care and pharmaceutical supply chain, an important decision that appears to be leading towards further and more aggressive efforts by states in this area. The Federal Trade Commission in mid-2022 also launched sweeping investigations into the practices of the PBM industry

  that could lead to additional federal legislative or regulatory proposals targeting such entities’ operations, pharmacy networks, or financial arrangements. Significant efforts to change the PBM industry as it currently exists in the U.S. may affect the entire pharmaceutical supply chain and the business of other stakeholders, including pharmaceutical companies like us. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 The FDA, in conjunction with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, regulates all advertising and promotion activities for products under FDA’s jurisdiction prior to and after approval, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA. There are also continuing annual user fee requirements that are now assessed as program fees for certain NDA-approved drugs. 
 Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties, and often reflect a physician’s belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for the patient. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. 
 Our commercial marketing of CAPLYTA and related business activities could become subject to scrutiny and enforcement under one or more federal or state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations. These fraud and abuse laws, and other applicable health care laws include: 
 

• | The federal Anti-Kickback Law, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly or willingly offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any goods or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government, and which provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions against individuals or entities alleged to have submitted a false claim;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, or knowingly and willfully making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs (among others) covered by Medicare or Medicaid to report to CMS, on an annual basis,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
21 


 
information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, teaching hospitals, and certain advanced non-physician health care practitioners and physician ownership and investment interests, with such data then being made publicly available on a website maintained by CMS called Open Payments; and
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer, as well as other state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses related to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products, prohibit certain gifts or payments to health care providers in the state, and/or require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes of conduct.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. We also are subject to, or may in the future become subject to, U.S. federal and state, and foreign laws and regulations imposing obligations on how we collect, use, disclose, store and process personal information. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could result in liability or reputational harm and could harm our business. 
 Violations of fraud and abuse laws, or other health care laws may be punishable by significant criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties also may be imposed upon executive officers and employees, including criminal sanctions against executive officers under the so-called “responsible corporate officer” doctrine, even in situations where the executive officer did not intend to violate the law and was unaware of any wrongdoing. Given the penalties that may be imposed on companies and individuals if convicted, allegations of such violations often result in settlements even if the company or individual being investigated admits no wrongdoing. Settlements often include significant civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and corporate integrity agreements. If the government was to allege or convict us or our executive officers, employees or consultants of violating these laws, our business could be harmed. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring similar actions under some of the fraud and abuse laws described above. Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above and due to the broad scope of these laws and extensive enforcement of them by law enforcement authorities. Further, federal and state laws that require manufacturers to make reports on pricing and marketing information could subject us to penalty provisions. 
 Human Capital 
 As of February 1, 2023, we employed 561 employees all of whom were full-time. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. To successfully commercialize CAPLYTA and develop our drug candidates, we must be able to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. We anticipate hiring a number of additional employees during 2023. We continually evaluate the business need and opportunity and balance in-house expertise and capacity with outsourced expertise and capacity. Currently, we outsource substantial clinical trial work to clinical research organizations and drug manufacturing to contract manufacturers. 
 Compensation and Benefits 
 We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. Pharmaceutical companies both large and small compete for a limited number of qualified applicants to fill specialized positions. To attract qualified applicants, we offer a total rewards package consisting of base salary and cash target bonus, a comprehensive benefit package and equity compensation for every employee. Bonus opportunity and equity compensation increase as a percentage of total compensation based on level of responsibility. Actual bonus payout is based on performance.

 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 Much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. We value diversity at all levels. We believe that our business benefits from the different perspectives a diverse workforce brings, and we pride ourselves on having a strong, inclusive and positive culture based on our shared mission and values. 
 At all times we strive to distinguish ourselves as a respected biopharmaceutical company that is differentiated by top talent and innovative research to develop products that address underserved medical needs. 
 Communication is critical in our ability to continuously enhance our company culture and create a more inclusive environment. The implementation of an announcement board allowed us to share what is important and impactful to us as a business. It also allows for us to host events that affect our employees on both a personal and professional level. 
 Health, Wellness and Safety 
 We believe that the safety and health of our employees and their families is essential to our business. Our culture is driven by a desire to do what is right, and we strive to support the well-being of our employees. We prioritize the safety and well-being of our employees as they face both mental and physical challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our employees have demonstrated great resilience during the pandemic, and we continue to provide resources to support their well-being. Beginning in March 2020, we have supported our employees and government efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic through a multi-faceted communication, infrastructure, and behavior modification and enforcement effort that includes: 
 

• | establishing clear and regular COVID-19 policies, safety protocols, and updates to all employees;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strongly encouraging all office-based employees to work from home; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | implementing protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our financial, medical, and mental health benefits that were already in place prior to the COVID-19 pandemic were designed to help employees through crisis, and we further expanded our offerings to create appropriate “work from home” conditions for success and wellness, including purchasing additional IT equipment and office supplies and increasing communications related to our mental health benefits. In particular, we offered sessions on mindfulness to further support the mental health of our employees. 
 Environmental, Social and Governance 
 Our commitment to integrating sustainability across our organization begins with our Board of Directors, or the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board has oversight of strategy and risk management related to Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG. Applying Nasdaq’s listing standards for independence, four of our five directors are independent. 
 All employees are responsible for upholding our core values, including to communicate, collaborate, innovate and be respectful, as well as for adhering to our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, including our policies on bribery, corruption, conflicts of interest and our whistleblower program. We encourage employees to come to us with observations and complaints, ensuring we understand the severity and frequency of an event in order to escalate and assess accordingly. Our Chief Compliance Officer strives to ensure accountability, objectivity, and compliance with our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct. If a complaint is financial in nature, the Audit Committee Chair is notified concurrently, which triggers an investigation, action and report. 
 We are committed to protecting the environment and attempt to mitigate any negative impact of our operations. We monitor resource use, improve efficiency, and at the same time, reduce our emissions and waste.

 In order to reduce the overall impact of our product on the environment, we have taken steps to enhance the sustainability of our manufacturing processes for our drug substances. 
 We are systematically addressing the environmental impacts of the buildings we rent as we make improvements, including adding energy control systems and other energy efficiency measures. Waste in our own operation is minimized by our commitment to reduce both single-use plastics and operating paper-free, primarily in a digital environment. We have safety protocols in place for handling biohazardous waste in our labs, and we use third-party vendors for biohazardous waste and chemical disposal. 
 Corporate Information 
 We were originally incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2012 under the name “Oneida Resources Corp.” Oneida Resources Corp. was a “shell” company registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, with no specific business plan or purpose until it began operating the business of Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc.
