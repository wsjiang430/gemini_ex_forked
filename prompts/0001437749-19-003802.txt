Description of Business
 
Real Estate
 
Our Real Estate segment includes all land planning, entitlement, development and sales activities of our landholdings on Maui. Our principal real estate development is the Kapalua Resort, a master-planned, destination resort and residential community located in West Maui encompassing approximately 3,000 acres. The following is a summary of our landholdings as of December 31, 2018:

 | West Maui | | Upcountry Maui | | Total
-----------------------+-----------+--------+-----------------+-------+------
Fully entitled urban | | 900 | | – | | 900 
Agricultural zoned | | 10,800 | | 2,100 | | 12,900
Conservation/watershed | | 9,000 | | – | | 9,000 
 | | 20,700 | | 2,100 | | 22,800

Real Estate Planning and Entitlements – Appropriate entitlements must be obtained for land that is intended for development. Securing proper land entitlements is a process that requires obtaining county, state and federal approvals, which can take many years to complete and entails a variety of risks. The entitlement process requires that we satisfy all conditions and restrictions imposed in connection with such governmental approvals, including, among other things, construction of infrastructure improvements, payment of impact fees – for conditions such as schools, public parks and traffic mitigation – restrictions on permitted uses of the land, and provision of affordable housing. We actively work with the community, regulatory agencies, and legislative bodies at all levels of government in an effort to obtain necessary entitlements consistent with the needs of the community.

We have approximately 1,200 acres of land in Maui that are in various stages of the development process. The following is a summary of our development projects as of December 31, 2018:

Hali’imaile Town | | 300 | | No | | 2029 - 2034 | | | $0.6 | $100 - $200 

 
We are engaged in planning, permitting and entitlement activities for our development projects, and we intend to proceed with construction and sales of the following projects, among others, when internal and external factors permit:
 

• | Kapalua Resort: We began development of the Kapalua Resort in the early 1970’s. Today, the Kapalua Resort is an internationally recognized world-class destination resort and residential community. We presently have entitlements to develop a variety of projects in the Kapalua Resort. Two that are currently planned include Kapalua Mauka and Kapalua Central Resort.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Kapalua Mauka is a long-term expansion project of the Kapalua Resort which is located directly upslope of the existing resort development. As presently planned, it encompasses 800 acres and includes up to 639 residential units with extensive amenities, including up to 27 additional holes of golf. State and County land use entitlements have been secured for this project.
 
Kapalua Central Resort is a commercial town center and residential community located in the core of the Kapalua Resort. It is comprised of 46 acres and is planned to include up to 61,000 square feet of commercial space and 188 condominium and multi-family residential units. State and County land use entitlements have been secured for this project.
 

• | Hali`imaile Town: An expansion of an existing plantation town in Upcountry Maui, this project is contemplated to be a holistic traditional community with agriculture and sustainability as core design elements. The project includes 290 acres classified as “Small Town” in the long-range County of Maui Island Plan. This designation allows the potential for residential, industrial and commercial development at a moderate density. We are in the early stages of this project’s development and securing State and County land use entitlements are expected to take several years.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Projected development costs are expected to be financed by debt financing, private investment, joint ventures with other development or construction companies, or a combination of these methods.
 
Real Estate Sales – Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Kapalua Realty Company, Ltd., provides licensed, general brokerage services for properties in the Kapalua Resort and surrounding areas.
 
Revenues from our Real Estate segment totaled $0.4 million, or approximately 4% of our total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
The price and market for luxury and other real estate in Maui are highly cyclical and influenced significantly by interest rates, the general real estate markets in the mainland United States and specifically the West Coast, the popularity of Hawaii as a vacation destination and second-home market, the general condition of the economy in the United States and Asia, and the relationship of the dollar to foreign currencies. Our Real Estate segment faces substantial competition from other land owners and developers on the island of Maui, as well as in other parts of Hawaii and the mainland United States.

Leasing
 
Our Leasing segment operations include residential, resort, commercial, agricultural and industrial land and property leases, licensing of the Company’s registered trademarks and trade names, and stewardship and conservation efforts.
Commercial and Industrial Leases – We are the owner and lessor of approximately 190,000 square feet of commercial, retail and light industrial properties, including restaurants, retail outlets, office buildings, warehouses and Kapalua Resort activities. The following summarizes information related to our commercial and industrial leases as of December 31, 2018:

 | Total | | Average | | 
----------------+---------+---------+------------+-----+-----------------

 | Footage | | Percentage | | Expiration Dates
Kapalua Resort | | 56,577 | | 98% | | 2019–2048 
Other West Maui | | 13,509 | | 83% | | 2019

Trademark and Trade Name Licensing – We currently have licensing agreements for the use of our registered Kapalua and other trademarks and trade names with several different companies, mainly in conjunction with our agricultural, commercial and industrial leases.
Stewardship and Conservation – We manage the conservation of a 9,000-acre nature and watershed preserve in West Maui. A portion of our stewardship and conservation efforts is subsidized by the State of Hawaii, the County of Maui, and other organizations.
 
Revenues from our Leasing segment totaled $6.2 million, or approximately 56% of our total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
Our Leasing segment operations are highly sensitive to economic conditions including tourism and consumer spending levels. Our Leasing segment operations also face substantial competition from other property owners in Maui and Hawaii.
 
Utilities
 
Our Utilities segment includes the operations of two Hawaii Public Utilities Commission-regulated subsidiaries, Kapalua Water Company, Ltd. and Kapalua Waste Treatment Company, Ltd. In addition, our Utilities segment includes the operations of several major non-potable irrigation water systems in West and Upcountry Maui.
Kapalua Water Company, Ltd. provides potable and non-potable water utility services to the Kapalua Resort, including its golf courses, hotels, residential subdivisions, commercial properties and landscaped common areas.
 
Kapalua Waste Treatment Company, Ltd. provides sewage collection and transmission services for the Kapalua Resort. Waste water treatment is processed by the County of Maui Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility.
 
Non-Potable Irrigation Water Systems – We own and operate several non-potable wells, irrigation ditches, reservoirs and transmission systems serving the Kapalua Resort, the County of Maui, and agricultural users in West and Upcountry Maui.
 
Revenues from our Utilities segment totaled $3.2 million, or approximately 29% of our total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
Our Utilities segment operations are primarily affected by the amount of rainfall and the level of development and volume of visitors in the Kapalua Resort. Our water and sewage system infrastructure requires periodic and ongoing maintenance, which in some cases can involve significant capital expenditures. Due to the regulated nature surrounding water sources and transmission infrastructure on Maui, our Utilities segment does not face any substantial competition.

Resort Amenities
 
Our Resort Amenities segment includes the operations of the Kapalua Club, a private, non-equity club providing its members special programs, access and other privileges at certain of the amenities at the Kapalua Resort including a 30,000 square foot full-service spa and a private pool-side dining beach club.
 
Revenues from our Resort Amenities segment totaled $1.1 million, or approximately 11% of our total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
The viability of the Kapalua Club is principally dependent on the overall appeal and success of the Kapalua Resort. The resort faces competition from other resort destination communities on Maui and other parts of Hawaii.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 14 full-time employees, none of whom are members of a collective bargaining group.
