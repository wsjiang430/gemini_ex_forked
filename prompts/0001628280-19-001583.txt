Item 1.  Business
Overview

Retail Opportunity Investments Corp., a Maryland corporation (“ROIC”) commenced operations in October 2009 as a fully integrated, self-managed REIT, and as of December 31, 2018, ROIC owned an approximate 90.8% partnership interest and other limited partners owned the remaining 9.2% partnership interest in the Operating Partnership.  The Company specializes in the acquisition, ownership and management of necessity-based community and neighborhood shopping centers on the west coast of the United States, anchored by supermarkets and drugstores.  The Company is organized in a traditional umbrella partnership real estate investment trust (“UpREIT”) format pursuant to which Retail Opportunity Investments GP, LLC, its wholly-owned subsidiary, serves as the sole general partner of, and ROIC conducts substantially all of its business through, its operating partnership, Retail Opportunity Investments Partnership, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”), together with its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s portfolio consisted of 92 properties (91 retail and one office) totaling approximately 10.5 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”).

ROIC’s only material assets are its direct or indirect partnership interests in the Operating Partnership and membership interest in Retail Opportunity Investments GP, LLC, which is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. As a result, ROIC does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the parent company and through this subsidiary, acts as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all the assets of the Company and directly or indirectly holds the ownership interests in the Company’s real estate ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the Company’s business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for net proceeds from equity issuances by ROIC, which are contributed to the Operating Partnership, the Operating Partnership generates the capital required by the Company’s business through the Operating Partnership’s operations, by the Operating Partnership’s incurrence of indebtedness (directly and through subsidiaries) or through the issuance of operating partnership units (“OP Units”) of the Operating Partnership.

Investment Strategy

The Company seeks to acquire shopping centers located in densely populated, supply-constrained metropolitan markets on the west coast of the United States, which exhibit income and population growth and high barriers to entry.  The Company’s senior management team has operated in the Company’s markets for over 25 years and has established an extensive network of relationships in these markets with key institutional and private property owners, brokers and financial institutions and other real estate operators.  The Company’s in-depth local and regional market knowledge and expertise provides a distinct competitive advantage in identifying and accessing attractive acquisition opportunities, including properties that are not widely marketed.

The Company seeks to acquire high quality necessity-based community and neighborhood shopping centers anchored by national and regional supermarkets and drugstores that are well-leased, with stable cash flows.  Additionally, the Company acquires shopping centers which it believes are candidates for attractive near-term re-tenanting or present other value-enhancement opportunities.

Upon acquiring a shopping center, the Company normally commences leasing initiatives aimed at enhancing long-term value through re-leasing below market space and improving the tenant mix.  The Company focuses on leasing to retailers that provide necessity-based, non-discretionary goods and services, catering to the basic and daily needs of the surrounding community.  The Company believes necessity-based retailers draw consistent, regular traffic to its shopping centers, which results in stronger sales for its tenants and a more consistent revenue base.  Additionally, the Company seeks to maintain a strong and diverse tenant base with a balance of large, long-term leases to major national and regional retailers, including supermarkets, drugstores and discount stores, with small, shorter-term leases to a broad mix of national, regional and local retailers.  The Company believes the long-term anchor tenants provide a reliable, stable base of rental revenue, while the shorter-term leases afford the Company the opportunity to drive rental growth, as well as the ongoing flexibility to adapt to evolving consumer trends.
The Company believes that the current market environment continues to present opportunities for it to further build its portfolio and add additional necessity-based community and neighborhood shopping centers that meet its investment profile.  The Company’s long-term objective is to prudently build and maintain a diverse portfolio of necessity-based community and 
5

neighborhood shopping centers aimed at providing stockholders with sustainable, long-term growth and value through all economic cycles.

In implementing its investment strategy and selecting an asset for acquisition, the Company analyzes the fundamental qualities of the asset, the inherent strengths and weaknesses of its market, sub-market drivers and trends, and potential risks and risk mitigants facing the property.  The Company believes that its acquisition process and operational expertise provide it with the capability to identify and properly underwrite investment opportunities.

The Company’s aim is to seek to provide diversification of assets, tenant exposures, lease terms and locations in its portfolio.  In order to capitalize on the changing sets of investment opportunities that may be present in the various points of an economic cycle, the Company may expand or refocus its investment strategy.  The Company’s investment strategy may be amended from time to time, if approved by its board of directors.  The Company is not required to seek stockholder approval when amending its investment strategy.

Financing Activities

The Company employs prudent amounts of leverage and uses debt as a means of providing funds for the acquisition of its properties and the diversification of its portfolio.  The Company seeks to primarily utilize unsecured debt in order to maintain liquidity and flexibility in its capital structure.
Term Loan and Credit Facility

On September 29, 2015, the Company entered into a term loan agreement under which the lenders agreed to provide a $300.0 million unsecured term loan facility.

The Term Loan Agreement also provides that the Company may from time to time request increased aggregate commitments of $200.0 million under certain conditions set forth in the Term Loan Agreement, including the consent of the lenders for the additional commitments. Borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement accrue interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to an applicable rate based on the credit rating level of the Company, plus, as applicable, (i) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the relevant period (the “Eurodollar Rate”), or (ii) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the rate of interest announced by the Administrative Agent as its “prime rate,” and (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.10%.

6

satisfaction of certain conditions including the payment of extension fees. Additionally, the credit facility contains an accordion feature, which allows the Operating Partnership to increase the borrowing capacity up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion, subject to lender consents and other conditions. Borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to an applicable rate based on the credit rating level of the Company, plus, as applicable, (i) the Eurodollar Rate, or (ii) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the rate of interest announced by KeyBank, National Association as its “prime rate,” and (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00%. Additionally, the Operating Partnership is obligated to pay a facility fee at a rate based on the credit rating level of the Company, currently 0.20%, and a fronting fee at a rate of 0.125% per year with respect to each letter of credit issued under the credit facility. The Company has investment grade credit ratings from Moody’s Investors Service (Baa2) and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (BBB-).

Both the term loan and credit facility contain customary representations, financial and other covenants. The Operating Partnership’s ability to borrow under the term loan and credit facility are subject to its compliance with financial covenants and other restrictions on an ongoing basis. The Operating Partnership was in compliance with such covenants at December 31, 2018.

Business Segments

The Company’s primary business is the ownership, management, and redevelopment of retail real estate properties. The Company reviews operating and financial information for each property on an individual basis and therefore, each property represents an individual operating segment. The Company evaluates financial performance using property operating income, defined as operating revenues (base rent and recoveries from tenants), less property and related expenses (property operating expenses and property taxes). The Company has aggregated the properties into one reportable segment as the properties share similar long-term economic characteristics and have other similarities including the fact that they are operated using consistent business strategies, are typically located in major metropolitan areas, and have similar tenant mixes.

Regulation

The following discussion describes certain material U.S. federal laws and regulations that may affect the Company’s operations and those of its tenants.  However, the discussion does not address state laws and regulations, except as otherwise indicated.  These state laws and regulations, like the U.S. federal laws and regulations, could affect the Company’s operations and those of its tenants.

Generally, real estate properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations.  Changes in any of these laws or regulations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response and Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, increase the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on the properties.  In addition, laws affecting development, construction, operation, upkeep, safety and taxation requirements may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, loss of real estate property sites or other impairments, which would adversely affect its cash flows from operating activities.

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the “Americans with Disabilities Act”) all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain U.S. federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons.  A number of additional U.S. federal, state and local laws also exist that may require modifications to properties, or restrict certain further renovations thereof, with respect to access thereto by disabled persons.  Noncompliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any non-complying feature and in substantial capital expenditures.  To the extent the Company’s properties are not in compliance, the Company may incur additional costs to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Property management activities are often subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state.

Environmental Matters

Pursuant to U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be required to investigate, remove and/or remediate a release of hazardous substances or other regulated materials at or emanating from such property.  Further, under certain circumstances, such owners or operators of real property may be held liable for property damage, personal injury and/or natural resource damage resulting from or arising in connection with such releases.  Certain of these laws have been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility.  The failure to properly remediate the property may also adversely affect the owner’s ability to lease, sell or rent the property or to borrow funds using the property as collateral.

In connection with the ownership, operation and management of the Company’s current properties and any properties that it may acquire and/or manage in the future, the Company could be legally responsible for environmental liabilities or costs relating to a release of hazardous substances or other regulated materials at or emanating from such property.  In order to assess the potential for such liability, the Company conducts an environmental assessment of each property prior to acquisition and manages its properties in accordance with environmental laws while it owns or operates them.  All of its leases contain a comprehensive environmental provision that requires tenants to conduct all activities in compliance with environmental laws and to indemnify the owner for any harm caused by the failure to do so.  In addition, the Company has engaged qualified, reputable and adequately insured environmental consulting firms to perform environmental site assessments of its properties and is not aware of any environmental issues that are expected to materially impact the financial condition of the Company.

Competition

The Company believes that competition for the acquisition, operation and development of retail properties is highly fragmented.  The Company competes with numerous owners, operators and developers for acquisitions and development of retail properties, including institutional investors, other REITs and other owner-operators of necessity-based community and neighborhood shopping centers, primarily anchored by supermarkets and drugstores, some of which own or may in the future own properties similar to the Company’s in the same markets in which its properties are located.  The Company also faces competition in leasing available space to prospective tenants at its properties.  The actual competition for tenants varies depending upon the characteristics of each local market (including current economic conditions) in which the Company owns and manages property.  The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in attracting tenants in its market areas are location, demographics, price, the presence of anchor stores and the appearance of properties.

Many of the Company’s competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, marketing and other resources than the Company.  Other entities may raise significant amounts of capital, and may have investment objectives that overlap with those of the Company, which may create additional competition for opportunities to acquire assets.  In the future, competition 
8

from these entities may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to the Company or increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell.  Further, as a result of their greater resources, such entities may have more flexibility than the Company does in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract tenants.  If the Company’s competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates, or below the rental rates the Company currently charges its tenants, the Company may lose potential tenants and it may be pressured to reduce its rental rates below those it currently charges in order to retain tenants when its tenants’ leases expire.

Employees

As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 71 employees, including three executive officers, one of whom is also a member of its board of directors and 19 maintenance employees at the shopping centers.
