Item 1. Business. 
Our Company
 Blackstone / GSO Secured Lending Fund was formed on March 26, 2018 as a Delaware statutory trust structured as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the  Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the  rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “1940 Act”). In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we intend to elect to be treated as a regulated investment company (a “RIC”) under the Internal Revenue Code of  1986, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “Code”). We are managed by our Adviser. GSO Capital Partners LP (the “Administrator” and, collectively with its affiliates in the credit-focused business of The Blackstone Group L.P., “GSO,” which, for the avoidance of doubt, excludes Harvest Fund Advisors LLC and Blackstone Insurance Solutions) provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. 
 Our investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation.  
 Under normal market conditions, we expect to invest at least 80% of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in secured debt investments (including investments that are secured by equity interests). We anticipate that our portfolio will be composed primarily of first lien senior secured and unitranche loans (including first out/last out loans), generally with total investment sizes less than $300 million, which criteria may change from time to time. To a lesser extent, we may also invest in second lien, third lien, unsecured or subordinated loans, generally with total investment sizes less than $100 million, which criteria may change from time to time, and other debt and equity securities. We do not expect to focus on investments in issuers that are distressed or in need of rescue financing. Subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act, we may invest in loans or other securities, the proceeds of which may refinance or otherwise repay debt or securities of companies whose debt is owned by other GSO funds.  As of December 31, 2018, based on fair value, our portfolio consisted of 98.84% first lien senior secured investments and unitranche loans and 1.16% second lien debt investments. All of our debt investments as of December 31, 2018 are floating rate in nature, all of which are subject to an interest rate floor. As of December 31, 2018 we had investments in 61 portfolio companies, with a weighted average investment size in each of our portfolio companies of approximately $8.9 million based on fair value.
 We began our investment activities in November 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we had acquired $616.9 million aggregate principal amount of investments (including $54.7 million of unfunded commitments), $393.4 million of which were directly originated loans and anchor orders in syndicated loans and $223.5 million of which were broadly syndicated loans (including, in each case, investments made through warehousing arrangements).  
 We seek to distribute substantially all of our available earnings annually by making quarterly cash distributions.  We use leverage and intend to continue to use leverage for our investment activities. We intend to use leverage, which is permitted up to the maximum amount allowed by the 1940 Act (currently limited to a debt-to-equity ratio of 2:1), to enhance potential returns. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources—Borrowings.”
 Our Investment Adviser
 Our investment activities are managed by our Adviser, a subsidiary of GSO Capital Partners LP, the primary investment manager for GSO. The principal executive offices of our Adviser are located at 345 Park Avenue, 31st Floor New York, NY, 10154. Our Adviser is responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis.
 In conducting our investment activities, we believe that we benefit from the significant scale and resources of GSO, including our Adviser and its affiliates, subject to the policies and procedures of The Blackstone Group L.P. (collectively with its affiliates as the context requires, “Blackstone”) regarding the management of conflicts of interest. In order to source transactions, the Adviser will utilize its significant access to transaction flow, along with its trading platform. The Adviser will seek to generate investment opportunities through direct origination channels as well as through syndicate and club deals. With respect to GSO’s origination channel, the global presence of GSO generates access to a substantial amount of directly originated transactions with what we believe to be attractive investment characteristics. With respect to syndicate and club deals (i.e., where a limited number of investors participate in a loan transaction), GSO has built a network of relationships with commercial and investment banks, finance companies and other investment funds as a result of the long track record of its investment professionals in the leveraged finance marketplace. GSO employs a rigorous investment process and defensive investment approach to evaluate all potential opportunities with a focus on long-term credit performance and principal protection. The investment professionals employed by GSO have spent their careers developing the resources necessary to invest in private companies. Before undertaking an investment, the Adviser’s transaction team will conduct a thorough and rigorous due diligence review of the opportunity to ensure the company fits our investment strategy.
 2

Our Adviser’s investment committee (the “Investment Committee”) is responsible for reviewing and approving our investment opportunities. The Adviser’s Investment Committee review process is consensus-driven, multi-step and iterative, and occurs in parallel with the diligence and structuring of investments. Others who participate in the Investment Committee process include the team responsible for conducting due diligence, others on the investing team and other senior members of GSO.  There are no representatives from other business groups of Blackstone involved in the Adviser’s Investment Committee process.
 We will pay our Adviser a management fee at an annual rate of (i) prior to an Exchange Listing (defined below), 0.75%, and (ii) following an Exchange Listing, 1.0%, in each case of the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. We will also pay the Adviser incentive fees based on income and capital gains. See “—Investment Advisory Agreement.”
 The members of the senior management and Investment Team of the Adviser serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do, or of investment funds managed by the same personnel. As a result, the Adviser, its officers and employees and certain of its affiliates will have conflicts of interest in allocating their time between us and other activities in which they are or may become involved, including the management of its affiliated equipment funds. See “—Allocation of Investment Opportunities and Potential Conflicts of Interests” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Adviser and Its Affiliates; Conflicts of Interest.”
 Our Administrator
 GSO Capital Partners LP, a Delaware limited partnership, serves as our Administrator. The principal executive offices of GSO Capital Partners LP are located at 345 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10154. The Administrator hired a sub-administrator to assist in the provision of administrative services. The sub-administrator will receive compensation for its sub-administrative services under a sub-administration agreement. See “—Administration Agreement.”
 GSO
 GSO is part of Blackstone’s credit-focused platform and is the primary part of its credit reporting segment. Blackstone’s alternative asset management business includes private equity funds, real estate funds, real estate investment trusts, funds of hedge funds, hedge funds, credit-focused funds, collateralized loan obligation vehicles, separately managed accounts and registered investment companies. 
 Blackstone’s business is generally organized into four segments: private equity, real estate, hedge fund solutions and credit. Through its different investment businesses, as of December 31, 2018, Blackstone had total assets under management of approximately $472 billion. As of December 31, 2018, GSO’s asset management operation had aggregate assets under management of approximately $100 billion across multiple strategies within the leveraged finance marketplace, including loans, high yield bonds, distressed and mezzanine debt and private equity, including hedge funds. GSO, through its affiliates, employed approximately 356 people in New York, London, Houston and Dublin as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, GSO had a 82 person Performing Credit Investments team (excluding Bennett Goodman and Dwight Scott, GSO’s senior management) focused on the sourcing, structuring, execution management and realization of performing credit investments (which includes those professionals who focus primarily on direct lending investments).  GSO believes that the depth and breadth of its team provides it with a significant competitive advantage in sourcing product on a global basis, structuring transactions and actively managing investments in the portfolio.  
 Market Opportunity
 We believe that there are and will continue to be significant investment opportunities in the targeted asset classes discussed below.
 Attractive Opportunities in Senior Secured Loans
 We believe that opportunities in senior secured loans are significant because of the variable rate structure of most senior secured debt issues and because of the strong defensive characteristics of this investment class. Given current market conditions, we believe that debt issues with variable interest rates may offer a superior return profile to fixed-rate securities, since variable interest rate structures are generally less susceptible to declines in value experienced by fixed-rate securities in a rising interest rate environment.
 Senior secured debt provides strong defensive characteristics. Because this debt has priority in payment among an issuer’s security holders (i.e., holders are due to receive payment before junior creditors and equity holders), they carry the least potential risk among investments in the issuer’s capital structure. Further, these investments are secured by the issuer’s assets, which may be seized in the event of a default, if necessary. They generally also carry restrictive covenants aimed at ensuring repayment before junior creditors, such as most types of unsecured bondholders, and other security holders and preserving collateral to protect against credit deterioration.
 3

Opportunity in Middle Market Private Companies
 In addition to investing in senior secured loans generally, we believe that the market for lending to private companies, particularly middle market private companies within the United States, is underserved and presents a compelling investment opportunity. We believe that the following characteristics support our belief:
 Large Target Market. Middle market companies represent a large and growing portion of the U.S. economy. According to the National Center for the Middle Market, there were nearly 200,000 middle market companies in the United States with annual revenues between $10 million and $1 billion, as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2017, middle market companies represented $6.5 trillion of the U.S. gross domestic product and employed approximately 25% of the nation’s workforce, compared to less than 20% in 2011 (see Middle Market Power Index, Dun & Bradstreet (Jan. 2018); 4Q 2018 Middle Market Indicator, National Center for the Middle Market; Components of Value Added by Industry, Bureau of Economic Analysis (as of Nov. 2, 2017); All Countries GDP, The World Bank). Further, these middle market companies represent, we believe, a significant portion of the growth segment of the U.S. economy, with 7.9% of revenue growth in the past twelve months as of December 31, 2018 compared to 4.7% for S&P 500 companies, according to the National Center of the Middle Market, and often require substantial capital investment to grow their businesses. Middle market companies have generated a significant number of investment opportunities for investment programs advised by GSO and its affiliates over the past several years, and we believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us.
 In addition, we believe the large amount of dry powder held by funds of private equity firms, estimated by Preqin Ltd., an alternative assets industry data and research company, to be $1.9 trillion as of December 2018, should continue to drive deal activity.
 Limited Investment Competition. Despite the size of the market, we believe that regulatory changes and other factors have diminished the role of traditional financial institutions and certain other capital providers in providing financing to middle market companies. As tracked by S&P Capital IQ LCD, U.S. banks’ share of senior secured loans has declined from 33.1% in 1995 to 3.9% in December 2018. In addition, due to bank consolidation, the number of banks has also rapidly declined, furthering the lack of supply in middle market lending. As of May 2018, there were approximately 5,000 banks in the U.S., which was only one-third of the number of banks in 1984, according to Federal Reserve Economic Data.
 We also believe that lending and originating new loans to middle market companies, which are often private, generally requires a greater dedication of the lender’s time and resources compared to lending to larger companies, due in part to the smaller size of each investment and the often fragmented nature of information available from these companies. Further, we believe that many investment firms lack the breadth and scale necessary to identify investment opportunities, particularly in regards to directly originated investments in middle market companies, and thus attractive investment opportunities are often overlooked. In addition, middle market companies may require more active monitoring and participation on the lender’s part. We believe that many large financial organizations, which often have relatively high cost structures, are not suited to deal with these factors and instead emphasize services and transactions to larger corporate clients with a consequent reduction in the availability of financing to middle market companies.
 Attractive Market Segment. We believe that the underserved nature of such a large segment of the market can at times create a significant opportunity for investment. In many environments, we believe that middle market companies are more likely to offer attractive economics in terms of transaction pricing, up-front and ongoing fees, prepayment penalties and security features in the form of stricter covenants and quality collateral than loans to larger companies. In addition, as compared to larger companies, middle market companies sometimes have simpler capital structures and carry less leverage, thus aiding the structuring and negotiation process and allowing us greater flexibility in structuring favorable transactions. We believe that these factors will result in advantageous conditions in which to pursue our investment objectives of generating current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation.
Competitive Strengths
 GSO is a key player in the middle and upper-middle market direct lending space. GSO has experience scaling funds across its platform that invest throughout all parts of the capital structure. GSO strives to focus on transactions where it can differentiate itself from other providers of capital, targeting larger transactions and those where GSO can bring its expertise and experience in negotiating and structuring. We believe that GSO is one of the few investment management firms with the scale and platform to effectively manage a U.S. direct lending investment strategy, offering investors the following potential competitive strengths:
 Scale of GSO Platform 
 We believe that the breadth and scale of GSO’s approximately $100 billion platform, as of December 31, 2018, gives GSO a distinct competitive advantage in sourcing proprietary investment opportunities and provides GSO with a differentiated capability to invest in large, complex opportunities. GSO covers over 1,220 corporate credits globally and has focused primarily on the non-investment grade corporate credit market for 13 years. GSO expects that in the current environment, in which committed capital from banks remains scarce (as tracked by S&P Capital IQ LCD, U.S. banks’ share of senior secured debt to middle market companies represented 12% of the overall middle market loan volume in 2018, down from nearly 20% in 2011), the ability to provide flexible, well-structured capital commitments in appropriate sizes will enable GSO to command more favorable terms for its investments. GSO believes that it occupies a differentiated position in the leveraged finance market, with investment activities that span a broad array of public and private market strategies. We believe this presence enables 
 4

GSO to identify opportunities early and select those investments that GSO believes offer the most attractive risk-adjusted return profile. In addition, when banks are facing difficulties in syndicating new issues, GSO’s ability to serve as a large “anchor” investor can help facilitate the successful completion of a transaction. We believe the depth of the experience of GSO’s senior management team, together with the wider resources of GSO’s team of investment professionals (the “Investment Team”), which is dedicated to sourcing, structuring, executing, monitoring and harvesting a broad range of private investments, will provide us with a significant competitive advantage in sourcing and analyzing what we believe to be attractive investment opportunities.
 Sourcing and Origination Capabilities 
 As of December 31, 2018,  GSO had a 82 person Performing Credit Investments team (excluding Bennett Goodman and Dwight Scott, GSO’s senior management) focused on the sourcing, structuring, execution, management and realization of performing credit investments (which includes those professionals who focus primarily on direct lending investments). We believe that GSO’s strong reputation and longstanding relationships with corporate boards, management teams, leveraged buyout sponsors, financial advisors, and intermediaries position GSO as a partner and counterparty of choice and provides us with superior sourcing capabilities. In GSO’s experience, these relationships help drive substantial proprietary deal flow and insight into investment opportunities. 
 GSO has a broad and diversified origination platform that we believe allows GSO to drive deal flow through various market cycles while maintaining quality control. In particular, we believe that GSO’s dedicated energy team provides a distinct competitive advantage. Furthermore, GSO has established a reputation for providing creative, value-added solutions to address portfolio companies’ financing requirements and believes that the ability to “solve a problem” for a company can lead to attractive investment opportunities.
 GSO seeks to generate investment opportunities through its direct origination channels and through syndicate and club deals (generally, investments made by a small group of investment firms). With respect to GSO’s origination channel, we seek to leverage the global presence of GSO to generate access to a substantial amount of directly originated transactions with attractive investment characteristics. We believe that the broad network of GSO provides a significant pipeline of investment opportunities for us. With respect to syndicate and club deals, GSO has built a network of relationships with commercial and investment banks, finance companies and other investment funds as a result of the long track record of its investment professionals in the leveraged finance marketplace. GSO also has a significant trading platform, which, we believe, allows us access to the secondary market for investment opportunities.
 Flexible Investment Approach
 GSO believes that the ability to invest opportunistically throughout a capital structure provides a meaningful competitive advantage in sourcing transactions and enables the Company to seek investments that provide the best risk/return proposition in any given transaction.  GSO’s creativity and flexibility with regard to deal-structuring distinguishes it from other financing sources, including traditional mezzanine providers, whose investment mandates are typically more restrictive.  Over time, GSO has demonstrated the ability to negotiate more favorable terms for its investments by providing creative structures that add value for an issuer.  GSO will continue to seek to use this flexible investment approach to focus on principal preservation, while generating attractive returns throughout different economic and market cycles.
Long-Term Investment Horizon
 Our long-term investment horizon gives us great flexibility, which we believe allows us to maximize returns on our investments. Unlike most private equity and venture capital funds, as well as many private debt funds, we will not be required to return capital to our shareholders (“Shareholders”) once we exit a portfolio investment. We believe that freedom from such capital return requirements, which allows us to invest using a longer-term focus, provides us with a better opportunity to increase total returns on invested capital, compared to other private company investment vehicles.
Disciplined Investment Process and Income-Oriented Investment Philosophy
 GSO employs a rigorous investment process and defensive investment approach to evaluate all potential opportunities with a focus on long-term credit performance and principal protection. We believe GSO has generated attractive risk-adjusted returns in its investing activities throughout many economic and credit cycles by (i) maintaining its investment discipline; (ii) performing intensive credit work; (iii) carefully structuring transactions; and (iv) actively managing its portfolios. GSO’s investment approach involves a multi-stage selection process for each investment opportunity, as well as ongoing monitoring of each investment made, with particular emphasis on early detection of deteriorating credit conditions at portfolio companies which would result in adverse portfolio developments. This strategy is designed to maximize current income and minimize the risk of capital loss while maintaining the potential for long-term capital appreciation. Additionally, GSO’s senior investment professionals have dedicated their careers to the leveraged finance and private equity sectors and we believe that their experience in due diligence, credit analysis and ongoing management of investments is invaluable to the success of the U.S. direct lending investment strategy that we will employ. GSO targets businesses with leading market share positions, sustainable barriers to entry, high free cash flow generation, strong asset values, liquidity to withstand market cycles, favorable underlying industry trends, strong internal controls and high-quality management teams.

Ability to Leverage Blackstone’s Group Purchasing Organization 
 Blackstone’s Group Purchasing Organization (“GPO”) is a collective purchasing platform that leverages the scale and buying power of the $5 billion of average annual spending of Blackstone’s portfolio companies with strategic partners and vendors measured over the past ten years. Blackstone and GSO portfolio companies have generated significant cost savings through their use of the GPO, ranging from 3% to 40%, often from existing suppliers, on maintenance, repair, operations, back office, information technology, hardware, software, telecommunications, business insurance and human resources, among others. The benefits of working with Blackstone’s GPO can include improved pricing and terms, differentiated service, and ongoing service that may benefit the applicable portfolio company’s performance.
Investment Strategy
 Our investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. We will seek to meet our Investment objectives by:
  
• | utilizing the experience and expertise of the management team of the Adviser, along with the broader resources of GSO, which include its access to the relationships and human capital of GSO’s parent, Blackstone, in sourcing, evaluating and structuring transactions, subject to Blackstone’s policies and procedures regarding the management of conflicts of interest;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | employing a defensive investment approach focused on long-term credit performance and principal protection, generally lending on a basis of 3.5 times to 5.5 times the borrower’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) (which is generally measured on a forward basis using estimated projections of the Adviser and may include certain adjustments) and at loan-to-value ratios of 50%-65% (with value being the Adviser’s estimate of enterprise value of the borrower) and also seeking favorable financial covenant protections. The methodology for calculating enterprise value can vary by company and industry, but would typically be based on (i) observable market prices for the company’s debt and equity securities (when available), (ii) comparable company analysis, or (iii) discounted cash flow analysis; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | focusing primarily on loans and securities, including syndicated loans, of private U.S. companies, specifically small and middle market companies, which we define as companies with annual revenue of $50 million to $2.5 billion, at the time of investment. Specifically, we expect to target companies with $25 million to $75 million of EBITDA. In many market environments, we believe such a focus offers an opportunity for superior risk-adjusted returns;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | investing primarily in established, stable enterprises with positive cash flows; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintaining rigorous portfolio monitoring in an attempt to anticipate and pre-empt negative credit events within our portfolio.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under normal market conditions, we expect to invest at least 80% of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in secured debt investments (including investments that are secured by equity interests). We anticipate that our portfolio will be composed primarily of first lien senior secured and unitranche loans (including first out/last out loans), generally with total investment sizes less than $300 million, which criteria may change from time to time. To a lesser extent, we may also invest in second lien, third lien, unsecured or subordinated loans, generally with total investment sizes less than $100 million, which criteria may change from time to time, and other debt and equity securities. We do not expect to focus on investments in issuers that are distressed or in need of rescue financing.  Subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act, we may invest in loans or other securities the proceeds of which may refinance or otherwise repay debt or securities of companies whose debt is owned by other GSO funds. 
 Although we do not expect a significant portion of our portfolio to be composed of second lien, third lien, unsecured or subordinated loans, there is no limit on the amount of such loans in which we may invest, subject to compliance with our 80% policy. We may purchase interests in loans or make other debt investments, including investments in senior secured bonds, through secondary market transactions in the “over-the-counter” market or directly from our target companies as primary market, directly originated or syndicated investments. In connection with our debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests such as warrants or options as additional consideration. We may also purchase or otherwise acquire minority interests in the form of common or preferred equity or equity-related securities, such as rights and warrants that may be converted into or exchanged for our common shares of beneficial interest (“Shares”) or other equity or the cash value of Shares or other equity, in our target companies, generally in conjunction with one of our debt investments or through a co-investment with a financial sponsor, such as an institutional investor or private equity firm, or a finance company transaction (such as a joint venture). In addition, a portion of our portfolio may be composed of unsecured bonds, CLOs, other debt securities and derivatives, including total return swaps and credit default swaps. Depending on market conditions, we may increase or decrease our exposure to less senior portions of the capital structure or otherwise make opportunistic investments. 
 Investment Selection
 When identifying prospective investment opportunities, the Adviser currently intends to rely on fundamental credit analysis in order to minimize the loss of the Company’s capital. The Adviser expects to invest in companies possessing the following attributes, which it believes will help achieve our investment objective:
 6

Leading, Defensible Market Positions. The Adviser intends to invest in companies that it believes have developed strong positions within their respective markets and exhibit the potential to maintain sufficient cash flows and profitability to service their obligations in a range of economic environments. The Adviser will seek companies that it believes possess advantages in scale, scope, customer loyalty, product pricing, or product quality versus their competitors, thereby minimizing business risk and protecting profitability.
 Stable Companies with Positive Cash Flow. The Adviser intends to invest in established, stable companies which have demonstrated a record of profitability and cash flows over economic cycles. The Adviser believes such companies are well-positioned to maintain consistent cash flow to service and repay their obligations and maintain growth in their businesses or market share. The Adviser does not intend to invest in start-up companies, companies in turnaround situations or companies with speculative business plans.
 Proven Management Teams. The Adviser intends to focus on investments in which the target company has an experienced and high-quality management team with an established track record of success. The Adviser will typically require companies to have in place proper incentives to align management’s goals with the Company’s goals.
 Private Equity Sponsorship. Often the Adviser will seek to participate in transactions sponsored by what it believes to be high-quality private equity firms. The Adviser believes that a private equity sponsor’s willingness to invest significant sums of equity capital into a company is an implicit endorsement of the quality of the investment. Further, private equity sponsors of companies with significant investments at risk generally have the ability and a strong incentive to contribute additional capital in difficult economic times should operational issues arise, which could provide additional protections for our investments.
 Diversification. The Adviser will seek to invest broadly among companies and industries, thereby potentially reducing the risk of a downturn in any one company or industry having a disproportionate impact on the value of the Company’s portfolio.
 Viable Exit Strategy. In addition to payments of principal and interest, we expect the primary methods for the strategy to realize returns on our investments include refinancings, sales of portfolio companies, and in some cases initial public offerings and secondary offerings. While many debt securities in which we will invest have stated maturities of five to eight years, virtually all are redeemed or sold prior to maturity.  These securities often have call protection that requires an issuer to pay a premium if it redeems in the early years of an investment. The Investment Team regularly reviews investments and related market conditions in order to determine if an opportunity exists to realize returns on a particular investment.  We believe the Adviser’s ability to utilize the entire resources of GSO, including the public market traders and research analysts, allows the Adviser to gain access to current market information where the opportunity may exist to sell positions into the market at attractive prices.
Investment Process
 Our investment activities will be managed by our Adviser. The Adviser will be responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis.
 The investment professionals employed by GSO have spent their careers developing the resources necessary to invest in private companies. Our transaction process is highlighted below.

Sourcing and Origination
 In order to source transactions, the Adviser will utilize its significant access to transaction flow, along with its trading platform. The Adviser will seek to generate investment opportunities primarily through direct origination channels, and also through syndicate and club deals. With respect to GSO’s origination channel, the global presence of GSO generates access to a substantial amount of directly originated transactions with what we believe to be attractive investment characteristics. With respect to syndicate and club deals, GSO has built a network of relationships with commercial and investment banks, finance companies and other investment funds as a result of the long track record of its investment professionals in the leveraged finance marketplace. We believe that GSO’s strong reputation and longstanding relationships with its broad network will help drive substantial proprietary deal flow and provide a significant pipeline of investment opportunities for us.

Evaluation
 Initial Review.  The Investment Team will examine information furnished by the target company and external sources, including banks, advisors and rating agencies, if applicable, to determine whether the investment meets our basic investment criteria within the context of proper allocation of our portfolio among various issuers and industries, and offers an acceptable probability of attractive returns with identifiable downside risk. In the case of directly originated transactions, GSO conducts detailed due diligence investigations. For the majority of securities available on the secondary market, a comprehensive analysis is conducted and continuously maintained by a dedicated GSO research analyst, the results of which are available for the transaction team to review. 
 Credit Analysis/Due Diligence. Before undertaking an investment, the Investment Team will conduct a thorough and rigorous due diligence review of the opportunity to ensure the company fits our investment strategy, which may include: 

• | a full operational analysis to identify the key risks and opportunities of the target’s business, including a detailed review of historical and projected financial results;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a detailed analysis of industry and customer dynamics, competitive position, regulatory, tax and legal matters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | on-site visits and customer and supplier reference calls, if deemed necessary;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | background checks to further evaluate management and other key personnel;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a review by legal and accounting professionals, environmental or other industry consultants, if necessary;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | financial sponsor due diligence, including portfolio company and lender reference checks, if necessary; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a review of management’s experience and track record.
--+------------------------------------------------------

 Third parties will often be involved in the Adviser’s due diligence process, whether they are hired by the Adviser or by the lead sponsor in a transaction. Utilizing consultants to help evaluate a business and test an investment thesis is typically very beneficial. When possible, the Adviser will seek to structure transactions in such a way that our target companies are required to bear the costs of due diligence, including those costs related to any outside consulting work we may require.
 The foregoing initial assessment is then followed by extensive credit analysis, including asset valuation, financial analysis, cash flow analysis and scenario analysis, legal and accounting review, and comparable credit and equity analyses. A thorough assessment of structure and leverage of a transaction and how the particular investment fits into the overall investment strategy of the portfolio is conducted. GSO’s typical diligence process for an originated investment opportunity spans two to six months, from the initial screen through final approval and funding.  Depending on the deal, each deal team typically consists of three to four investment professionals, consisting of a portfolio manager, managing director, principal or vice president and associate and/or analyst.
 Investment Committee Process. The Investment Committee review process is multi-step and iterative, and occurs in parallel with the diligence and structuring of investments. The initial investment screening process involves an Investment Committee “Heads-Up” review presentation by the portfolio manager and members of the deal team. The Heads-Up review involves the production of a short memo with a focus on the following diligence items: an early diligence review of the underlying business fundamentals; expected return potential; expected investment size; assessment of key risks; and an appropriate initial diligence plan. At this point in the decision-making process, the Investment Committee will decide whether or not the Investment Team should proceed with deeper diligence on the investment opportunity.
 Once in-depth diligence has begun, the deal team will present updates at regularly-held Investment Committee meetings. The senior team reviews all activity for the prior meeting, with a focus on detailed updates of ongoing situations and in-depth review of all new investment opportunities. The type of diligence materials reviewed at these meetings for each company may include, but are not limited to:
  
• | Detailed historical financial performance
--+------------------------------------------


• | Financial models with detailed revenue drivers
--+-----------------------------------------------


o | This includes the construction of a base case, a downside case and specifically tailored cases. This process includes probability-weighted analysis and a range of outcomes analysis. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Quarterly liquidity analyses
--+-----------------------------


• | Industry analysis incorporating internal and external work from research analysts and industry consultants
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Competitive position and market share analysis
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | Customer analysis, including revenue, profitability and concentration risk
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pricing and volume analyses
--+----------------------------

 8

 
• | Detailed fixed vs. variable cost analysis, and line item analysis of cost of goods sold as well as selling, general and administrative expenses
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Public and private credit and equity comparable analysis
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | Accounting quality of earnings analysis
--+----------------------------------------


• | Legal due diligence
--+--------------------

 The ultimate results and findings of the investment analysis are compiled in comprehensive investment memoranda that are used as the basis to support the investment thesis and are utilized by the Investment Committee for final investment review and approval.  Each investment requires the consent of the Investment Committee, which may emphasize the following key criteria (among others) in making a decision:
  
• | Company Analysis: Does the company meet the investment criteria defined by the “GSO Scorecard”?: 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Leading market share position
--+------------------------------


o | Sustainable barriers to entry that drive pricing power
--+-------------------------------------------------------


o | High-quality management team
--+-----------------------------


o | Stable financials: strong free cash flow generation, high EBIT margins
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Conservative capital structure with underlying equity value
--+------------------------------------------------------------


o | Liquidity to withstand market cycles
--+-------------------------------------


• | Industry Analysis: Is there a favorable industry structure with respect to customers, suppliers and regulation?
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Due Diligence: Have we fully diligence each of the investment criteria specified by the GSO Scorecard? Have we completely vetted each of the risk factors identified throughout the diligence and Investment Committee process?
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Valuation: What is the intrinsic value of the business? How has the business historically generated returns on capital? Will these returns continue in the future? What growth opportunities does the business have, if any? Is there substantial equity value to support the capital structure? 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Risk of Principal Loss & Risk/Reward: What is the expected recovery in a severe downside case? Does the expected upside appropriately compensate for risk of loss? 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Return Hurdles: Is the investment expected to generate a rate of return that meets the Company’s objectives? 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exit Plan: Do we expect refinancings, a sale of the company, or other exit opportunities?
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monitoring
 Portfolio Monitoring. Active management of our investments is performed by the team responsible for making the initial investment.  The Adviser believes that actively managing an investment allows the Investment Team to identify problems early and work with companies to develop constructive solutions when necessary. The Adviser will monitor our portfolio with a focus toward anticipating negative credit events. In seeking to maintain portfolio company performance and help to ensure a successful exit, the Adviser will work closely with, as applicable, the lead equity sponsor, loan syndicator, portfolio company management, consultants, advisers and other security holders to discuss financial position, compliance with covenants, financial requirements and execution of the company’s business plan. In addition, depending on the size, nature and performance of the transaction, we may occupy a seat or serve as an observer on a portfolio company’s board of directors or similar governing body.
Exit
 In addition to payments of principal and interest, we expect the primary methods for the strategy to realize returns on its investments include refinancings, sales of portfolio companies, and in some cases initial public offerings and secondary offerings. While many debt securities in which we will invest have stated maturities of five to eight years, virtually all are redeemed or sold prior to maturity.  These securities often have call protection that requires an issuer to pay a premium if it redeems in the early years of an investment. However, there is no assurance that our investments will achieve realization events as a result of refinancings, sales of portfolio companies or public offerings and these realization events will become more unlikely when conditions in the loan and capital markets have deteriorated.
 The Investment Team regularly reviews investments and related market conditions in order to determine if an opportunity exists to realize returns on a particular investment.  We believe the Adviser’s ability to utilize the entire resources of GSO, including the public market traders and research analysts, allows the Adviser to gain access to current market information where the opportunity may exist to sell positions into the market at attractive prices.

Allocation of Investment Opportunities and Potential Conflicts of Interest
 GSO, including the Adviser, provides investment management services to other registered investment companies, investment funds, client accounts and proprietary accounts that GSO may establish (other than the Company) (collectively the “Other GSO Clients”). In addition, Blackstone provides investment management services to other registered investment companies, investment funds, client accounts and proprietary accounts that Blackstone may establish (together with the Other GSO Clients, the “Other Clients”).  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Adviser and Its Affiliates; Conflicts of Interest—There may be conflicts of interest related to obligations that the Adviser’s senior management and Investment Team have to other clients.”
 Co-Investment Relief
 We have received an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) that permits us, among other things, to co-invest with certain other persons, including certain affiliates of the Adviser and certain funds managed and controlled by the Adviser and its affiliates, subject to certain terms and conditions. Pursuant to such order, the board of trustees of the Company (the “Board”) has established objective criteria (“Board Criteria”) clearly defining co-investment opportunities in which the Company will have the opportunity to participate with one or more listed or private GSO-managed BDCs (including the Company, the “GSO BDCs”), and other public or private GSO funds that target similar assets. If an investment falls within the Board Criteria, GSO must offer an opportunity for the GSO BDCs to participate.  The GSO BDCs may determine to participate or not to participate, depending on whether GSO determines that the investment is appropriate for the GSO BDCs (e.g., based on investment strategy).  The co-investment would generally be allocated to us, any other GSO BDCs and the other GSO funds that target similar assets pro rata based on available capital in the applicable asset class.  If the Adviser determines that such investment is not appropriate for us, the investment will not be allocated to us, but the Adviser will be required to report such investment and the rationale for its determination for us to not participate in the investment to the Board at the next quarterly board meeting.

See the Consolidated Schedule of Investments as of December 31, 2018  in our consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Consolidated Schedule of Investments” for more information on these investments.
 As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding commitments to fund delayed draw term loans totaling $54.7 million. 
 Capital Resources and Borrowings
 As a RIC, we intend to distribute substantially all of our net income to our stockholders. We anticipate generating cash in the future from the issuance of Shares and cash flows from operations, including interest received on our debt investments.
 Additionally, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of shares senior to our Shares if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. As of December 31, 2018, our asset coverage was 227.8%. 
 Furthermore, while any indebtedness and senior securities remain outstanding, we must take provisions to prohibit any distribution to our Shareholders (which may cause us to fail to distribute amounts necessary to avoid entity-level taxation under the Code), or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. In addition, we must also comply with positive and negative covenants customary for these types of facilities.

 Warehousing Transactions
 We entered into two warehousing transactions whereby we agreed, subject to certain conditions, to purchase certain assets from parties unaffiliated with the Adviser. Such warehousing transactions were designed to assist us in deploying capital upon receipt of drawdown proceeds. One of these warehousing transactions relates primarily to originated or anchor investments in middle market loans (the “Middle Market Warehouse”).  The other warehouse related primarily to broadly syndicated loans (the “Syndicated Warehouse” and, together with the Middle Market Warehouse, the “Warehousing Transactions”) prior to the acquisition of the equity interests of the Syndicated Warehouse by us and merger of the Syndicated Warehouse with our wholly-owned subsidiary, as described below. See—“Item 1A.—Risk Factors—Risks Related to an Investment in the Shares—Risks related to the Warehousing Transactions.”
 Investment Advisory Agreement
 The Adviser provides management services to us pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Investment Advisory Agreement has been approved by the Board.  Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is responsible for the following: 

• | determining the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes in accordance with our investment objective, policies and restrictions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | identifying investment opportunities and making investment decisions for us, including negotiating the terms of investments in, and dispositions of, portfolio securities and other instruments on our behalf;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | monitoring our investments;
--+----------------------------


• | performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | exercising voting rights in respect of portfolio securities and other investments for us;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | serving on, and exercising observer rights for, boards of directors and similar committees of our portfolio companies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | negotiating, obtaining and managing financing facilities and other forms of leverage; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | providing us with such other investment advisory and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of capital.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Adviser’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities, and it intends to do so, so long as its services to us are not impaired.
 Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay our Adviser a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components—a management fee and an incentive fee.
 Management Fee
 The management fee is payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of (i) prior to an Exchange Listing, 0.75%, and (ii) following an Exchange Listing, 1.0%, in each case of the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. For the first calendar quarter in which the Company has operations, gross assets will be measured as the average of gross assets at the Initial Drawdown Date (as defined below) and at the end of such first calendar quarter. For purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, gross assets means our total assets determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), excluding undrawn commitments but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts. If an Exchange Listing occurs on a date other than the first day of a calendar quarter, the management fee shall be calculated for such calendar quarter at a weighted rate calculated based on the fee rates applicable before and after the Exchange Listing based on the number of days in such calendar quarter before and after the Exchange Listing.
 12

Incentive Fee
 The incentive fee will consist of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on a percentage of our income and a portion is based on a percentage of our capital gains, each as described below.
Incentive Fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
 The portion based on our income is based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns” means, as the context requires, either the dollar value of, or percentage rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediate preceding quarter from, interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses accrued for the quarter (including the management fee, expenses payable under the administration agreement entered into between us and the Administrator (the “Administration Agreement”), and any interest expense or fees on any credit facilities or outstanding debt and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the incentive fee). 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns include, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with pay-in-kind (“PIK”) interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation.
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediate preceding quarter, is compared to a “hurdle rate” of return of 1.5% per quarter (6.0% annualized).
 Prior to an Exchange Listing, we will pay the Adviser an incentive fee quarterly in arrears with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in each calendar quarter as follows:
  
• | no incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.5%;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 100% of the dollar amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than a rate of return of 1.76% (7.06% annualized). We refer to this portion of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 1.76%) as the “catch-up.” The “catch-up” is meant to provide the Adviser with approximately 15% of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds 1.76% in any calendar quarter; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 15% of the dollar amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceed a rate of return of 1.76% (7.06% annualized). This reflects that once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, 15% of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns thereafter are allocated to the Adviser.

Percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income

 Following an Exchange Listing, we will pay the Adviser an incentive fee quarterly in arrears with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in each calendar quarter as follows:

• | no incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.5%;

• | 100% of the dollar amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than a rate of return of 1.82% (7.27% annualized). The “catch-up” is meant to provide the Adviser with approximately 17.5% of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds 1.82% in any calendar quarter; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 17.5% of the dollar amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceed a rate of return of 1.82% (7.27% annualized). This reflects that once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, 17.5% of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns thereafter are allocated to the Adviser.

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns Following an Exchange Listing
 (expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets)
 

Percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
 Allocated to Quarterly Incentive Fee
 These calculations are prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any Share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the incentive fee hurdle rate and may result in a substantial increase of the amount of incentive fees payable to the Adviser with respect to Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a calendar quarter in which we incur an overall loss taking into account capital account losses. For example, if we receive Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in excess of the quarterly hurdle rate, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that calendar quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. If an Exchange Listing occurs on a date other than the first day of a calendar quarter, the incentive fee shall be calculated for such calendar quarter at a weighted rate calculated based on the fee rates applicable before and after the Exchange Listing based on the number of days in such calendar quarter before and after the Exchange Listing.
Incentive Fee on Capital Gains
 The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, is payable at the end of each calendar year (or at the time of an Exchange Listing) in arrears.
 Prior to an Exchange Listing, the amount payable equals:
  
• | 15% of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year (or upon an Exchange Listing), computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Following an Exchange Listing, the amount payable equals:
  
• | 17.5% of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If an Exchange Listing occurs on a date other than the first day of a fiscal year, a capital gains incentive fee shall be calculated as of the day before the Exchange Listing, with such capital gains incentive fee paid to the Adviser following the end of the fiscal year in which the Exchange Listing occurred. For the avoidance of doubt, such capital gains incentive fee shall be equal to 15% of our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception through the day before the Exchange Listing, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. Solely for purposes of calculating the capital gains incentive fee after an Exchange Listing, the Company will be deemed to have previously paid capital gains incentive fees prior to an Exchange Listing equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the actual aggregate amount of previously paid capital gains incentive fees for all periods prior to an Exchange Listing by (b) the percentage obtained by dividing (x) 17.5% by (y) 15%.
 14

Each year, the fee paid for the capital gains incentive fee is net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee for all prior periods. We will accrue, but will not pay, a capital gains incentive fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Adviser if we were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. In no event will the capital gains incentive fee payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement be in excess of the amount permitted by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), including Section 205 thereof.
 The fees that are payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement for any partial period will be appropriately prorated.
 Administration Agreement
 Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Administrator will provide, or oversee the performance of, administrative and compliance services, including, but not limited to, maintaining financial records, overseeing the calculation of net asset value (“NAV”), compliance monitoring (including diligence and oversight of our other service providers),  preparing reports to Shareholders and reports filed with the SEC, preparing materials and coordinating meetings of our Board, managing the payment of expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others and providing office space, equipment and office services. We will reimburse the Administrator for its costs, expenses and allocable portion of overhead (including compensation of personnel performing administrative duties) in connection with the services performed for us pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Administrator may delegate its obligations under the Administration Agreement to an affiliate or to a third party and we will reimburse the Administrator for any services performed for us by such affiliate or third party. The Administrator hired a sub-administrator to assist in the provision of administrative services. The sub-administrator will receive compensation for its provision of sub-administrative services under a sub-administration agreement.
Certain Terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement
 Each of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement has been approved by the Board.  Unless earlier terminated as described below, each of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement will remain in effect for a period of two years from the date it first becomes effective and will remain in effect from year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by a majority of the Board or by the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities and, in each case, a majority of the independent trustees. We may terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement or the Administration Agreement, without payment of any penalty, upon 60 days’ written notice.  The decision to terminate either agreement may be made by a majority of the Board or the Shareholders holding a majority outstanding voting securities, which means the lesser of (1) 67% or more of such company’s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company.  In addition, the Adviser may terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement or the Administrator may terminate the Administration Agreement, without payment of any penalty, upon 60 days’ written notice.  The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate within the meaning of the 1940 Act and related SEC guidance and interpretations in the event of its assignment.
 The Adviser and the Administrator shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission or any loss suffered by the Company in connection with the matters to which the Investment Advisory Agreement  and Administration Agreement, respectively, relate, provided that the Adviser and Administrator shall not be protected against any liability to the Company or its Shareholders to which the Adviser or Administrator would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations (“disabling conduct”). Each of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement will provide that, absent disabling conduct, each of our Adviser and our Administrator, as applicable, and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it will be entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of our Adviser’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement and our Administrator’s services under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as adviser or administrator for us. The Adviser and the Administrator shall not be liable under their respective agreements with us or otherwise for any loss due to the mistake, action, inaction, negligence, dishonesty, fraud or bad faith of any broker or other agent; provided, that such broker or other agent shall have been selected, engaged or retained and monitored by the Adviser or the Administrator in good faith, unless such action or inaction was made by reason of disabling conduct, or in the case of a criminal action or proceeding, where the Adviser or Administrator had reasonable cause to believe its conduct was unlawful.
Expense Support
 On December 12, 2018, we entered into an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement (the “Expense Support Agreement”) with the Adviser.  The Expense Support Agreement provides that, at such times as the Adviser determines, the Adviser may pay certain expenses of the Company, provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any interest expense of ours (each, an “Expense Payment”). Such Expense Payment will be made in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than forty-five days after a written commitment from the Adviser to pay such expense, and/or by an offset against amounts due from us to the Adviser or its affiliates. Following any calendar quarter in which Available Operating Funds (as defined in the Expense Support Agreement) exceed the cumulative distributions accrued to our Shareholders based on distributions declared with respect to record dates occurring in such calendar quarter (such amount referred to as the “Excess Operating Funds”), we shall pay such Excess Operating Funds, or a portion thereof (each, a 
 15

“Reimbursement Payment”), to the Adviser until such time as all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to us within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter have been reimbursed. The amount of the Reimbursement Payment for any calendar quarter shall equal the lesser of (i) the Excess Operating Funds in such quarter and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to us within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter that have not been previously reimbursed by us to the Adviser. The Expense Support Agreement provides additional restrictions on the amount of each Reimbursement Payment for any calendar quarter. The Adviser may waive its right to receive all or a portion of any Reimbursement Payment in any particular calendar quarter, so that such Reimbursement Payment may be reimbursable in a future calendar quarter.
 Distributions 
 We generally intend to distribute substantially all of our available earnings annually by paying distributions on a quarterly basis, as determined by the Board in its discretion. We cannot assure investors that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions (particularly during the early stages of our operations) or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. We anticipate that our distributions will generally be paid from post-offering taxable earnings, including interest and capital gains generated by our investment portfolio, and any other income, including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees, that we receive from portfolio companies. However, if we do not generate sufficient taxable earnings during a year, all or part of a distribution may constitute a return of capital. The specific tax characteristics of our dividends and other distributions will be reported to Shareholders after the end of each calendar year.
Dividend Reinvestment Plan
 We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan, pursuant to which we will reinvest all cash dividends declared by the Board on behalf of our Shareholders who do not elect to receive their dividends in cash as provided below. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or other distribution, then our Shareholders who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional Shares as described below, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. Distributions on fractional Shares will be credited to each participating Shareholder’s account to three decimal places.
 Prior to an Exchange Listing, a participating Shareholder will receive an amount of Shares equal to the amount of the distribution on that participant’s Shares divided by the most recent fiscal quarter-end NAV per Share that is available on the date such distribution was paid (unless the Board determines to use the NAV per Share as of another time).
 Following an Exchange Listing, a participating Shareholder will receive an amount of Shares equal to the amount of the distribution on that participant’s Shares divided by the market price per Share at the close of regular trading on the applicable stock exchange on the date of such distribution, subject to certain adjustments described in the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan.
 We intend to use newly issued Shares to implement the plan. Shares issued under the dividend reinvestment plan will not reduce outstanding Capital Commitments.
 No action is required on the part of a registered Shareholder to have his, her or its cash dividend or other distribution reinvested in our Shares. Shareholders can elect to “opt out” of the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan in their Subscription Agreements.  A Shareholder may elect to receive its entire dividend in cash at any time by notifying the Company’s transfer agent in writing. If, however, a Shareholder requests to change its election within 95 days prior to a distribution, the request will be effective only with respect to distributions after the 95-day period.
 There are no brokerage charges or other charges to Shareholders who participate in the plan.
 The Board may amend or supplement the terms of the dividend reinvestment plan at any time without Shareholder approval.  The plan may be terminated by the Company at any time upon notice in writing mailed to each Shareholder of record.
 Our Private Offering
 We are conducting a private offering (the “Private Offering”) of Shares to accredited investors (as defined in Regulation D under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”)) in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act. Shares will be offered for subscription continuously throughout the period during which the Private Offering remains open.  Shares will be offered for subscription continuously throughout the Initial Closing Period (as defined below) and may be offered from time to time thereafter.  At each closing of the Private Offering, each investor participating in that closing will make a capital commitment (a “Capital Commitment”) to purchase our Shares pursuant to a subscription agreement relating to the Shares (the “Subscription Agreement”). Investors will be required to fund drawdowns to purchase our Shares up to the amount of their respective Capital Commitments on an as-needed basis each time we deliver a notice to the investors.

We expect closings of the Private Offering will occur, from time to time, in the Adviser’s sole discretion, during the 12 month period following the initial closing of Capital Commitments (which initial closing took place on October 31, 2018) (the “Initial Closing Period”), but the Adviser may modify the Initial Closing Period if approved by the Board, which could extend the Initial Closing Period through up to two additional extensions for up to one year each. We may accept and draw down Capital Commitments from investors throughout the Initial Closing Period. 
 After the Initial Closing Period, we may permit one or more additional closings (“Subsequent Closings”) as additional Capital Commitments are obtained.  We currently do not expect to draw any Capital Commitments from Subsequent Closings (“Subsequent Capital Commitments”) until 100% of the Capital Commitments from the Initial Closing Period (“Initial Capital Commitments”) have been drawn down, unless otherwise determined by our Board.
 We commenced our loan origination and investment activities contemporaneously with the receipt of the initial drawdown from investors in the Private Offering (the “Initial Drawdown”) on November 20, 2018.  The proceeds from the Initial Drawdown and borrowings from our credit facilities provided us with the necessary capital to commence operations.  See “—Credit Facilities.” We have entered into Warehousing Transactions (as defined below) that provide for the purchase of certain investments in connection with our commencement of operations. See “—Warehousing Transactions.”  We anticipate raising additional equity capital for investment purposes through additional closings under the Private Offering.
 We have entered, and expect to continue to enter, into separate Subscription Agreements with a number of investors providing for the private placement of Shares pursuant to the Private Offering and may enter into additional Subscription Agreements from time to time. We will deliver drawdown requests at least ten business days prior to the required funding date. For Initial Capital Commitments, purchases of our Shares will generally be made first by holders with the largest percentage of their Initial Capital Commitments undrawn and then, once all holders have the same percentage of undrawn Initial Capital Commitments outstanding, pro rata in accordance with remaining Initial Capital Commitments of all investors.
 The offering price per Share at the Initial Drawdown Date was $25. Following the Initial Drawdown Date, Shares have been and will be offered on a private placement basis at a price based on our NAV per Share, which will be approved by our Board and at all times consistent with U.S. GAAP. Each offering has been and will be subject to the limitations of Section 23(b) under the 1940 Act (which generally prohibits us from issuing Shares at a price below the then-current NAV of the Shares as determined within 48 hours, excluding Sundays and holidays, of such issuance (taking into account any investment valuation adjustments from the latest quarterly valuation date in accordance with the Company’s valuation policy), subject to certain exceptions). In order to more fairly allocate organizational and offering expenses among all Shareholders, investors subscribing after the Initial Drawdown Date will be required to bear a pro rata portion of such expenses at the time of their first investment in the Company.
 The “Initial Drawdown Period” began when Initial Capital Commitments were made and will continue until the earlier of (i) an Exchange Listing (as defined below) and (ii) the two-year anniversary of the end of the Initial Closing Period. During the Initial Drawdown Period and any drawdown period applicable to Subsequent Capital Commitments, the Adviser may issue capital calls for any permitted Company purpose. Subject to the Share repurchase program described herein, the Company generally does not intend to return any drawn capital.
Key Person Event
 A “Key Person Event” will occur if, during the Initial Drawdown Period, fewer than five of Bennett Goodman, Dwight Scott, Brad Marshall, Louis Salvatore, Rob Petrini, Dan Smith and Robert Zable, or their respective Qualified Replacements (as defined below) (such persons collectively, the “Key Persons”), are actively involved in and devoting sufficient time to the business and affairs of the Company as deemed reasonably necessary by the Adviser. Upon the occurrence of a Key Person Event, the Company will send written notice of the Key Person Event to the Shareholders within ten business days of such occurrence.
 If during the forty-five day period following the sending of such written notice (the “Notice Period”) the Key Persons (who are the subject of such Key Person Event) have not been replaced by the Adviser with a Qualified Replacement (as defined below), the Company shall convene a meeting of the Company’s independent trustees to be held no later than thirty days following the expiration of the Notice Period for the purpose of determining whether the Initial Drawdown Period shall be continued (the “Key Person Meeting”).
 If a majority of the independent trustees vote in favor of the proposal, the Initial Drawdown Period will be continued and Shareholders will be obligated to fund drawdowns as if a Key Person Event had never occurred. Otherwise, the Initial Drawdown Period shall be deemed to have terminated as of the date of the Key Person Meeting, except that further drawdowns may be made to fund any proposed investment (including any follow-on investment and investments pursuant to an investment commitment) for which the Adviser has, on behalf of the Company, made a commitment, placed a bid (whether binding or not) in a competitive bidding situation or entered into a letter of intent, term sheet, memorandum of understanding or other similar document (whether or not such document created a legally binding obligation to proceed with such investment) or a definitive agreement to proceed with such transaction (collectively, “Actively Pursued Potential Investments”) if such Actively Pursued Potential Investment was being actively pursued as of such Key Person Event.
 17

“Qualified Replacement” shall mean a senior investment professional selected by the Adviser; provided that such replacement has been approved by either (i) a majority of the independent trustees or (ii) the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares of the Company, and upon either such approval, such nominee shall constitute a Qualified Replacement.
 While we expect most Subscription Agreements to reflect the terms and conditions summarized in the preceding paragraph, we reserve the right to enter into Subscription Agreements or other agreements that contain terms and conditions not found in the Subscription Agreements or other agreements entered into with other investors, subject to applicable law. 
 Term
 We currently expect to consummate an Exchange Listing by the four-year anniversary of the end of the Initial Closing Period, subject to market conditions. If we have not consummated an Exchange Listing by the earlier of (i) the five-year anniversary of the end of the Initial Drawdown Period, as may be extended for up to an additional one-year period pursuant to the Adviser’s recommendation with the approval of the Board and (ii) the ten year anniversary following the date of the initial closing, then, the Board (subject to market conditions and any necessary Shareholder approvals and applicable requirements of the 1940 Act) will use its commercially reasonable efforts to wind down, sell and/or liquidate and dissolve the Company in an orderly manner.
 An “Exchange Listing” is a quotation or listing of the Company’s securities on a national securities exchange (including through an initial public offering) or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets to, or a merger or other liquidity transaction with, an entity in which the Company’s Shareholders receive shares of a publicly-traded company which continues to be managed by the Adviser or an affiliate thereof.
 Prior to an Exchange Listing, if the Board determines that there has been a significant adverse change in the regulatory or tax treatment of the Company or our Shareholders that in its judgment makes it inadvisable for the Company to continue in its present form, then the Board will endeavor to restructure or change the form of the Company to preserve (insofar as possible) the overall benefits previously enjoyed by our Shareholders as a whole or, if the Board determines it appropriate (and subject to any necessary Shareholders approvals and applicable requirements of the 1940 Act), (i) cause the Company to change its form and/or jurisdiction of organization or (ii) wind down and/or liquidate and dissolve the Company. The Board may also seek to change our form and/or jurisdiction of organization for other reasons. The Board may, at any time and in its discretion, cause us to merge with another BDC, private fund, separately managed account or another investment vehicle without Shareholder approval, subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act.
 In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, each Share would be entitled to share ratably in all of our assets that are legally available for distribution after we paid or otherwise provide for all debts and other liabilities and subject to any preferential rights of holders of our Preferred Shares, if any Preferred Shares are outstanding at such time. For the purposes of this paragraph, a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into any other corporation or other entity, or a sale or conveyance of all or any part of our property or assets will not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up, voluntary or involuntary.
 Emerging Growth Company
 We are and we will remain an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act until the earlier of (a) the last day of the fiscal year (i) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of an Exchange Listing, (ii) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (iii) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the date of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (b) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. For so long as we remain an “emerging growth company” we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). We cannot predict if investors will find our Shares less attractive because we may rely on some or all of these exemptions. If some investors find our Shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Shares and our Share price may be more volatile.
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the 1933 Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We currently are and intend to continue taking advantage of such extended transition periods.
 Competition
 We compete for investments with other BDCs and investment funds (including private equity funds, mezzanine funds and CLO funds), as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and other sources of funding. Moreover, alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, have begun to invest in areas in which they have not traditionally invested, including making investments in middle market private U.S. companies. As a result of these new entrants, competition for investment opportunities in middle market private U.S. companies may intensify. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than we have. These 
 18

characteristics could allow our competitors to consider a wider variety of investments, establish more relationships and offer better pricing and more flexible structuring than we are able to do. We may lose investment opportunities if we do not match our competitors’ pricing, terms and structure. If we are forced to match our competitors’ pricing, terms and structure, we may not be able to achieve acceptable returns on our investments or may bear substantial risk of capital loss. A significant part of our competitive advantage stems from the fact that the market for investments in middle market private U.S. companies is underserved by traditional commercial banks and other financial sources. A significant increase in the number and/or the size of our competitors in this target market could force us to accept less attractive investment terms. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC.
