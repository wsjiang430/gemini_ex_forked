Strengths
Market Position
Mohawk’s fashionable and innovative products, successful participation in all sales channels, creative marketing programs and extensive sales resources have enabled the Company to build market leadership positions in multiple geographies, primarily North America, Brazil, Europe, Russia and Australasia, as well as export products to more than 170 countries. In North America, Mohawk’s largest marketplace, the Company has leveraged its brands, breadth of offering and award-winning merchandising to build strong positions across all product categories. In Europe and Russia, similar advantages have supported market leadership in ceramic, premium laminate and sheet vinyl. The 2018 acquisition of Godfrey Hirst provided the Company with the largest position in carpet to complement the leading hard surface presence in Australasia that had grown through the earlier acquisition of national distributors in both Australia and New Zealand. In 2018, the Company acquired Eliane, a leading ceramic tile manufacturer in Brazil, the world’s third largest ceramic market. The Eliane brand is highly regarded for innovative design and strength in high-end porcelain floor and wall tile. Eliane is Brazil’s largest ceramic tile exporter. The Company also has established a strong position in the fast-growing LVT market on both sides of the Atlantic following the 2015 acquisition of IVC and subsequent investments to expand production in both North America and Europe. 
Product Innovation
Mohawk drives performance through product innovation and improvements across all categories. In ceramic, this includes proprietary Reveal Imaging® printing that replicates the appearance of other surfaces, such as long planks with the visuals and texture of natural wood as well as tiles that mimic natural stone, cement, textiles and other alternatives. In Italy, the Company has recently begun manufacturing porcelain large scale slabs that replicate the look of stone but are harder and more durable. The slabs are being sold in the European and North American markets and are used for floors, walls and countertops. In the U.S., the Company has begun to manufacture quartz countertops that, along with its stone and porcelain slabs, represent a comprehensive array of surface options. In carpet, exclusive fiber technologies include the unique bio-based SmartStrand® and its brand extensions that represented the first super soft stain resistant products on the market and the patented ContinuumTM process that adds bulk and softness to polyester fiber, differentiating the Company’s products in this fast growing component of the carpet market. These fiber advantages have been extended into the Company’s rug production, as well, adding luxurious feel and performance enhancements to the Company’s design leadership. In laminate, the Company’s installation technology revolutionized the category, and the Company continues to deliver new innovations with more realistic visuals and surface embossing in register that precisely recreates the appearance of wood and water resistance that has extended the category into kitchens and baths. In wood flooring, the Company is introducing longer and wider planks in increasingly popular engineered collections, as well as introducing more fashion-forward stains, finishes and surface protection. The Company’s vinyl offerings reflect significant investments in leading-edge technology that yield incredibly realistic reproductions of stone, wood and other materials with embossed finishes that accentuate the beauty of the products. 
Operational Excellence
Mohawk’s highly efficient manufacturing and distribution assets serve as the foundation for successful growth. By leveraging continuous process improvement and automation, the Company’s operations drive innovation, quality and value. Through its commitment to sustainability practices, the Company has also optimized natural resources and raw materials. Since 2013, the Company has invested approximately $4 billion to expand capacity, introduce differentiated new products and improve efficiencies. In particular, the Company’s capital investments have improved recently acquired businesses by upgrading their product offerings, expanding their distribution and improving their productivity. For more than a decade, Mohawk’s training and development programs have been ranked among the best by Training magazine, and Forbes designated Mohawk as one of the Best Large U.S. Employers from 2016 through 2018.
Sustainability
The Company believes that it is the industry leader in sustainable products and processes. The Company’s extensive use of recycled content in its products includes the annual use of over 6.2 billion plastic bottles to create polyester carpet fiber and more than 42 million pounds of tires to produce decorative crumb rubber mats. In all, the Company diverts more than 6.5 billion pounds of waste from landfills each year, with 47 of the Company’s manufacturing sites internally certified as Zero Process Waste to Landfill facilities. The Company’s commitment to sustainability extends beyond its products to resource utilization, including a 442-million gallon reduction in water use since 2015, lower greenhouse gas emissions and increased energy efficiency. The

Company also produces energy through solar panels, windmills and a waste to energy program using scrap material. The Company’s commitment to safety and wellness helps to retain a talented workforce. The Company currently operates 19 on-site, near-site or virtual Healthy Life Centers to assist employees with management of chronic conditions as well as the treatment of acute illness.

Industry and Competition
The Company is the largest flooring manufacturer in a fragmented industry composed of a wide variety of companies ranging from small, privately-held firms to large multinationals. In 2017, the U.S. floor covering industry reported $25.4 billion in sales, up approximately 4.8% over 2016’s sales of $24.5 billion. In 2017, the primary categories of flooring in the U.S., based on sales, were carpet and rugs (45.4%), resilient (includes sheet vinyl and LVT) and rubber (17.0%), ceramic tile (14.3%), wood (13.7%), stone (5.7%) and laminate (3.9%). In 2017, the primary categories of flooring in the U.S., based on square feet, were carpet and rugs (51.2%), resilient (includes sheet vinyl and LVT) and rubber (21.2%), ceramic tile (14.3%), wood (7.2%), laminate (4.6%) and stone (1.5%).  Each of these categories is influenced by the residential and commercial construction, and residential and commercial remodeling end-use markets. These markets are influenced by many factors including changing consumer preferences, consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, interest rates, inflation, availability of credit, turnover in housing and the overall strength of the economy.
The principal methods of competition within the floor covering industry generally are product innovation, style, quality, price, performance technology and service. In each of the markets, price and market coverage are particularly important when competing among product lines. The Company actively seeks to differentiate its products in the marketplace by introducing innovative products with premium features that provide a superior value proposition. The Company’s investments in manufacturing technology, computer systems and distribution network, as well as the Company’s marketing strategies and resources, contribute to its ability to compete on the basis of performance, quality, style and service, rather than price.
Global Ceramic Segment
Globally, the ceramic tile industry is significantly fragmented. Certain regions around the world have established sufficient capacity to allow them to meet domestic needs in addition to exporting product to other markets where their design and/or technical advantages may drive consumer preferences. Some mature markets have seen industry consolidation driven by mergers and acquisitions, however most markets are comprised of many relatively small manufacturers all working with similar technologies, raw materials and designs. During 2017, the estimated global capacity for ceramic tile was 146 billion square feet, with selling prices varying widely based on a variety of factors, including supply within the market, materials used, size, shape and design. While the Company operates ceramic manufacturing facilities in eight countries, the Company has leveraged advantages in technology, design, brand recognition and marketing to extend exports of its products to approximately 160 countries. As a result of this global sales strategy, the Company faces competition in the ceramic tile market from a large number of foreign and domestic manufacturers, all of which compete for sales of ceramic tile to customers through multiple residential and commercial channels. The Company believes it is the largest manufacturer, distributor and marketer of ceramic tile in the world. The Company also believes it is the largest manufacturer, distributor and marketer of ceramic tile in specific markets, including the U.S., Europe and Russia, as well as maintaining leading positions in the Mexican and Brazilian markets. The Company has leveraged the advantages of its scale, product innovation and unique designs in these markets to solidify its leadership position, however the Company continues to face pressures in these markets from imported ceramic products as well as alternate flooring categories.
Flooring NA Segment
The North American flooring industry is highly competitive, with an increasing variety of product categories, shifting consumer preferences and pressures from imported products, particularly in the rug and hard surface categories. Based on industry publications, in 2017, the U.S. flooring industry had carpet and rug sales in excess of $11.5 billion out of the overall $25.4 billion market. The Company believes it is the largest producer of rugs and the second largest producer of carpet in the world based on its 2017 net sales. The Company differentiates its carpet and rug products in the market place through proprietary fiber systems, state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies and unique styling as well as leveraging the strength of some of the oldest and best known brands in the industry. The Company also believes it is the largest manufacturer and distributor of laminate flooring in the U.S. as well as one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of solid and engineered wood flooring.  The Company’s leading position in laminate flooring is driven by the strength of its premium brands as well as technical innovations such as water resistance, realistic visuals, beveled edges, deeply embossed in register surfaces and patented installation technologies. The U.S. resilient industry is highly competitive, and according to industry publications, grew over 17% in 2017. Based on industry publications, the U.S. flooring industry for LVT and sheet vinyl in 2017 had market sales of $4.5 billion of the overall flooring market. The Company believes that it is one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of LVT and sheet vinyl in the U.S. The Company’s sheet vinyl operations produce fiberglass backed products, which have proven more popular with consumers in the past several years.

In addition, the Company believes it has a competitive advantage in its laminate flooring markets as a result of the Company’s industry-leading water resistance, realistic visuals and embossed in register surfaces as well as patented installation technologies, all of which allow the Company to distinguish its products in the areas of design, performance, installation and assembly. In wood flooring, the Company has extended the strength of its well-known laminate brands and its installation technologies to add value to its wood collections. The Company faces competition in the non-U.S. vinyl flooring channel from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers, but believes it has a competitive advantage in its LVT and sheet vinyl markets due to industry-leading design, patented technologies, brand recognition and vertical integration. The Company has elevated the performance of its sheet vinyl collections and is now aggressively placing the product in commercial applications. After initially extending its geographic footprint by acquiring national hard surface distributors in Australia and New Zealand, the Company acquired Godfrey Hirst in 2018, making the Company the largest manufacturer of carpet in both countries. The Company is integrating its soft and hard surface businesses to provide a comprehensive offering to residential and commercial customers in the region. In Australia and New Zealand, the Company faces competition from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers, but believes it has a competitive advantage in its carpet and hard surface offering due to industry-leading design, patented technologies, brand recognition and vertical integration.
