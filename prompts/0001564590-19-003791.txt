 Item 1. BUSINESS
Introduction
 Granite Construction Company was originally incorporated in 1922. In 1990, Granite Construction Incorporated was formed as the holding company for Granite Construction Company and its wholly owned and consolidated subsidiaries and was incorporated in Delaware. Unless otherwise indicated, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Company” and “Granite” refer to Granite Construction Incorporated and its wholly owned and consolidated subsidiaries.
 We deliver infrastructure solutions for public and private clients primarily in the United States. We are one of the largest diversified infrastructure companies in the United States. Within the public sector, we primarily concentrate on heavy-civil infrastructure projects, including the construction of streets, roads, highways, mass transit facilities, airport infrastructure, bridges, trenchless and underground utilities, power-related facilities, water-related facilities, utilities, tunnels, dams and other infrastructure-related projects. Within the private sector, we perform site preparation and infrastructure services for residential development, energy development, commercial and industrial sites, and other facilities, as well as provide construction management professional services.  
 On June 14, 2018, we completed the $349.8 million acquisition of Layne Christensen Company (“Layne”), a U.S.-based global water management, infrastructure services and drilling company in a stock-for-stock merger which was comprised of $321.0 million in Company common stock and $28.8 million in cash to settle all outstanding stock options, restricted stock awards and unvested performance shares of Layne. In addition to issuances of Granite common stock and the settlement of various equity awards, we assumed $191.5 million in convertible notes at fair value. Layne is a leader in water management and drilling and therefore this acquisition significantly enhances Granite’s presence in the water infrastructure market. Layne has a network of 52 offices located throughout North and Latin America. See Note 2 and Note 15 of “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of the acquisition and the assumed convertible notes, respectively. 
 In addition, on April 3, 2018, we acquired LiquiForce, a privately owned company which provides sewer lining rehabilitation services to public and private sector water and wastewater customers in both Canada and the U.S. We acquired LiquiForce for $35.9 million in cash primarily borrowed under our revolving credit facility. See Note 15 of “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of our revolving credit facility. 
 Layne will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Granite Construction Incorporated, and its results are reported in the newly formed Water and Mineral Services operating group in the Water, Specialty and Materials segments. LiquiForce results are reported in the Water and Mineral Services operating group in the Water segment.
 Operating Structure
 During the third quarter of 2018, we revised our reportable segments, which are the same as our operating segments, as a result of a change in how our chief operating decision maker (our Chief Executive Officer) regularly reviews financial information to allocate resources and assess performance. This change is consistent with our strategic, end-market diversification strategy. Our new reportable segments which correspond to this end-market focus are: Transportation, Water, Specialty and Materials. The end-market segments Transportation, Water and Specialty replace the Construction and Large Project Construction reportable segments with the composition of our Materials segment remaining unchanged except for the addition of proprietary sanitary and storm water rehabilitation products including cured-in-place pipe felt and fiberglass-based lining tubes related to the acquisition of Layne. Prior-year information has been recast to reflect this change. See Note 22 of “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information about our reportable business segments.
 In addition to business segments, we review our business by operating groups. Our operating groups are defined as follows: (i) California; (ii) Northwest, which primarily includes offices in Alaska, Arizona, Nevada, Utah and Washington; (iii) Heavy Civil, which primarily includes offices in California, Florida, New York and Texas; (iv) Federal which primarily includes offices in California, Colorado, Texas and Guam; (v) Midwest (formerly Kenny less the underground business), which primarily includes offices in Illinois and (vi) Water and Mineral Services (which includes LiquiForce, Layne and the underground business of the former Kenny operating group), which primarily includes offices across the Unites States, Canada and Latin America.
 Transportation: Revenue from our Transportation segment was $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion (59.5% and 65.1% of our total revenue) in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Transportation segment focuses on construction and rehabilitation of roads, pavement preservation, bridges, rail lines, airports and marine ports for use mostly by the general public.
 Water: Revenue from our Water segment was $338.3 million and $133.7 million (10.2% and 4.5% of our total revenue) in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Water segment focuses on water-related construction and water management solutions for municipal agencies, commercial water suppliers, industrial facilities and energy companies. It also provides trenchless cured-in-place pipe rehabilitation.
 Specialty: Revenue from our Specialty segment was $626.6 million and $615.8 million (18.9% and 20.6% of our total revenue) in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Specialty segment focuses on construction of various complex projects including infrastructure / site development, mining, public safety, tunnel and power projects.

In addition to our bid-build projects, we utilize alternative procurement methods of project delivery including, but not limited to, design-build, construction management/general contractor and construction management at-risk. Unlike traditional bid-build projects where owners first hire a design firm or design a project themselves and then put the project out to bid for construction, design-build projects provide the owner with a single point of responsibility and a single contact for both final design and construction. Although design-build projects carry additional risk as compared to traditional bid-build projects, the profit potential can also be higher. Under the construction management/general contractor and construction management at-risk methods of delivery, we contract with owners to assist the owner during the design phase of the contract with construction efficiencies, with the understanding that we will negotiate a contract on the construction phase when the design nears completion. Revenue from alternative procurement method projects represented 34.1%, 39.9% and 40.6% of construction related revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 We participate in joint ventures with other construction companies. Joint ventures are typically used for large, technically complex projects, including design-build projects, where it is necessary or desirable to share risk and resources. Joint venture partners typically provide independently prepared estimates, shared financing and equipment, and often bring local knowledge and expertise. For more information see the “Joint Ventures” section below.
 Materials: Revenue from our Materials segment to third parties was $376.8 million and $292.8 million (11.4% and 9.8% of our total revenue) in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Materials segment focuses on production of aggregates, asphalt and construction related materials as well as proprietary sanitary and storm water rehabilitation products including cured-in-place pipe felt and fiberglass-based lining tubes for both internal use and for sale to third parties. We have significant aggregate reserves that we own or lease through long-term leases. Sales to our construction projects represented 29.5% of our combined internal and external Materials sales during 2018, and ranged from 29.5% to 38.5% over the last five years. The remainder is sold to third parties.
Business Strategy
 Our business strategy is to consistently deliver ideas, innovations, products and services to our clients to power today’s mobile society by executing entrepreneurial market strategies that leverage the benefits of our company-wide resources and our core values. Our most fundamental objective is to increase long-term shareholder value as measured by the appreciation of the value of our common stock over a period of time, as well as dividend payouts. In alphabetical order, the following are key factors in our ability to achieve this objective:
 Decentralized Profit Centers - Each of our operating groups is established as an individual profit center which encourages entrepreneurial activity while allowing the operating groups to benefit from centralized administrative, operational expertise and support functions.
 Dedicated Construction Equipment - We own and lease a large fleet of well-maintained heavy construction equipment. Dedicated access to a large pool of construction equipment enables us to compete more effectively by ensuring availability and maximizing returns on investment of the equipment.
 Diversification - To mitigate the risks inherent in the construction business as the result of general economic factors, we pursue projects: (i) in both the public and private sectors; (ii) in diverse end markets such as federal, rail, power, water and renewable energy markets; (iii) for a wide range of clients from the federal government to small municipalities and from large corporations to individual homeowners; (iv) in diverse geographic markets; (v) that are construction management/general contractor, design-build and bid-build; (vi) at fixed price, time and materials, cost reimbursable and fixed unit price; and (vii) of various sizes, durations and complexity. In addition to pursuing opportunities with traditional project funding, we continue to evaluate other sources of project funding (e.g., public and private partnerships).
 Employee Development - We believe that our employees are the primary factor for the successful implementation of our business strategies. Significant resources are employed to attract, develop and retain extraordinary and diverse talent and fully promote each employee’s capabilities.
 Operational Excellence - We have a continual focus on Operational Excellence, which includes the following:
  
• | Code of Conduct - We believe in maintaining high ethical standards through an established code of conduct and an effective company-wide compliance program, while being guided by our core values at all times.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sustainability - Our focus on sustainability encompasses many aspects of how we conduct ourselves and practice our Core Values. We believe sustainability is important to our clients, employees, shareholders, and communities, and is also a long-term business driver. By focusing on specific initiatives that address social, environmental and economic challenges, we can minimize risk and increase our competitive advantage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Productivity - We strive to use our resources efficiently to deliver work on time and on budget.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Quality - We believe in satisfying our clients, mitigating risk, and driving improvement by performing work right the first time.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety - We believe the safety of our employees, the public and the environment is a moral obligation as well as good business. By identifying and concentrating resources to address jobsite hazards, we continually strive to eliminate our incident rates and the costs associated with accidents.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Performance-Based Incentives - Managers are incentivized with cash compensation and restricted stock unit equity awards, payable upon the attainment of pre-established annual financial and non-financial metrics.

Risk-Balanced Growth - We intend to grow our business by working on many types of infrastructure projects, as well as by expanding into new geographic areas and end markets organically and through acquisitions. Growth opportunities are evaluated relative to their incremental impact to the execution risk and profitability profile of our operating portfolio.
 Selective Bidding - We focus our resources on bidding jobs that meet our selective bidding criteria, which include analyzing the risk of a potential job relative to: (i) available personnel to estimate and prepare the proposal as well as to effectively manage and build the project; (ii) the competitive environment; (iii) our experience with the type of work and with the owner; (iv) local resources and partnerships; (v) equipment resources; and (vi) the size, complexity and expected profitability of the job.
 Vertical Integration - We own and lease aggregate reserves and own processing plants and liner tube manufacturing facilities that are vertically integrated into our construction operations. By ensuring availability of these resources and providing quality products, we believe we have a competitive advantage in many of our markets, as well as a source of revenue and earnings from the sale of construction materials and liner tubes to third parties.
Raw Materials
 We purchase raw materials, including but not limited to, aggregate products, cement, diesel and gasoline fuel, liquid asphalt, natural gas, propane, resin and steel from numerous sources. Our aggregate reserves supply a portion of the raw materials needed in our construction projects. The price and availability of raw materials may vary from year to year due to market conditions and production capacities. We do not foresee a lack of availability of any raw materials over the next twelve months.
Seasonality
 Our operations are typically affected more by weather conditions during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year which may alter our construction schedules and can create variability in our revenues, profitability and the required number of employees.
Customers
 Customers in our Transportation, Water and Specialty segments are predominantly in the public sector and include certain federal agencies, state departments of transportation, local transit authorities, county and city public works departments, school districts and developers, utilities and private owners of industrial, commercial and residential sites. Customers of our Materials segment include internal usage by our own construction projects, as well as third-party customers. Our third-party customers include, but, are not limited to, contractors, landscapers, manufacturers of products requiring aggregate materials, retailers, homeowners, farmers and brokers.
 During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our largest volume customer, including both prime and subcontractor arrangements, was the California Department of Transportation (“Caltrans”). Revenue recognized from contracts with Caltrans during 2018, 2017 and 2016 represented $282.9 million (8.5% of total revenue), $281.7 million (9.4% of total revenue) and $222.4 million (8.8% of total revenue), respectively, which was primarily in the Transportation segment.
 Contract Backlog
 Our contract backlog consists of the revenue we expect to record in the future on awarded contracts, including 100% of our consolidated joint venture contracts and our proportionate share of unconsolidated joint venture contracts. We generally include a project in our contract backlog at the time it is awarded and to the extent we believe contract execution and funding is probable. Certain government contracts where funding is appropriated on a periodic basis are included in contract backlog at the time of the award when it is probable the contract value will be funded and executed. Certain contracts contain contract options that are exercisable at the option of our customers without requiring us to go through an additional competitive bidding process or contain task orders that are signed under master contracts under which we perform work only when the customer awards specific task orders to us. Awarded contracts that include unexercised contract options and unissued task orders are included in contract backlog to the extent option exercise or task order issuance is probable.
 Substantially all of the contracts in our contract backlog may be canceled or modified at the election of the customer; however, we have not been materially adversely affected by contract cancellations or modifications in the past (see “Contract Provisions and Subcontracting”). Many projects are added to contract backlog and completed within the same fiscal year and, therefore, may not be reflected in our beginning or year-end contract backlog. Contract backlog by segment is presented in “Contract Backlog” under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Our contract backlog was $3.7 billion at both December 31, 2018 and 2017 and did not yet include approximately $700 million in project wins that will be added to contract backlog as task orders are approved. Approximately $2.3 billion of the December 31, 2018 backlog is expected to be completed during 2019.

Equipment
 At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we owned the following number of construction equipment and vehicles:
  
December 31, | 2018 | | 2017
----------------------------------------------+------+-------+-----
Heavy construction equipment | | 2,928 | | 1,905
Trucks, truck-tractors, trailers and vehicles | | 5,395 | | 3,618

 
Our portfolio of equipment includes backhoes, barges, bulldozers, cranes, excavators, loaders, motor graders, pavers, rollers, scrapers, trucks, special equipment for pipeline rehabilitation, drilling rigs and tunnel boring machines that are used in all of our segments. We pool certain equipment to maximize utilization. We continually monitor and adjust our fleet size so that it is consistent with the size of our business, considering both existing contract backlog and expected future work. We lease or rent equipment to supplement our portfolio of equipment in response to construction activity cycles. In 2018 and 2017, we spent $58.5 million and $43.6 million, respectively, on purchases of construction equipment and vehicles.
 Employees
 On December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 2,700 salaried employees who work in project, functional and business unit management, estimating and clerical capacities, plus approximately 3,000 hourly employees. The total number of hourly personnel is subject to the volume of construction in progress and is seasonal. During 2018, the number of hourly employees ranged from approximately 2,100 to 4,500 and averaged approximately 3,500. Five of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Granite Construction Company, Granite Construction Northeast, Inc., Granite Infrastructure Constructors, Inc., Kenny Construction Company and Layne Christensen Company, are parties to craft collective bargaining agreements in many areas in which they operate.
 We believe our employees are our most valuable resource, and our workforce possesses a strong dedication to and pride in our company. Our managerial and supervisory personnel have an average of approximately 11 years of service with Granite.
 Competition
 Competitors in our Transportation, Specialty and Water segments typically range from small, local construction companies to large, regional, national and international construction companies. We compete with numerous companies in individual markets; however, there are few, if any, companies which compete in all of our market areas. Many of our Transportation, Specialty and Water segment competitors have the ability to perform work in either the private or public sectors. When opportunities for work in one sector are reduced, competitors tend to look for opportunities in the other sector. This migration has the potential to reduce revenue growth and/or increase pressure on gross profit margins.
 We own and/or have long-term leases on aggregate resources that we believe provide a competitive advantage in certain markets for the Transportation, Specialty and Water segments.
 Competitors in our Materials segment typically range from small local materials companies to large regional, national and international materials companies. We compete with numerous companies in individual markets; however, there are few, if any, companies which compete in all of our market areas. 
 Factors influencing our competitiveness include price, estimating abilities, knowledge of local markets and conditions, project management, financial strength, reputation for quality, aggregate materials availability, and machinery and equipment. Historically, the construction business has not required large amounts of capital for the smaller size construction work, which can result in relative ease of market entry for companies possessing acceptable qualifications. By contrast, larger size construction work typically requires large amounts of capital that may make entry into the market by future competitors more difficult. Historically, the required amount of capital has not had a significant impact on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Although the construction business is highly competitive, we believe we are well positioned to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate.
 Contract Provisions and Subcontracting
 Contracts with our customers are primarily “fixed unit price” or “fixed price.” Under fixed unit price contracts, we are committed to providing materials or services at fixed unit prices (for example, dollars per cubic yard of concrete placed or cubic yard of earth excavated). While the fixed unit price contract shifts the risk of estimating the quantity of units required for a particular project to the customer, any increase in our unit cost over the expected unit cost in the bid, whether due to inflation, inefficiency, incorrect estimates or other factors, is borne by us unless otherwise provided in the contract. Fixed price contracts are priced on a lump-sum basis under which we bear the risk that we may not be able to perform the work for the specified contract amount. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our contract backlog was 64.0% and 66.9% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The percentage of fixed unit price contracts in our contract backlog was 30.8% and 29.8% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. All other contract types represented 3.9% and 3.3% of our contract backlog at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

With the exception of contract change orders and affirmative claims, which are typically sole-source, our construction contracts are primarily obtained through competitive bidding in response to solicitations by both public agencies and private parties and on a negotiated basis as a result of solicitations from private parties. Project owners use a variety of methods to make contractors aware of new projects, including posting bidding opportunities on agency websites, disclosing long-term infrastructure plans, advertising and other general solicitations. Our bidding activity is affected by such factors as the nature and volume of advertising and other solicitations, contract backlog, available personnel, current utilization of equipment and other resources and competitive considerations. Our contract review process includes identifying risks and opportunities during the bidding process and managing these risks through mitigation efforts such as contract negotiation, bid/no bid decisions, insurance and pricing. Contracts fitting certain criteria of size and complexity are reviewed by various levels of management and, in some cases, by the Executive Committee of our Board of Directors. Bidding activity, contract backlog and revenue resulting from the award of new contracts may vary significantly from period to period.
 There are a number of factors that can create variability in contract performance as compared to the original bid. Such factors can positively or negatively impact costs and profitability, may cause higher than anticipated construction costs and can create additional liability to the contract owner. The most significant of these include:
  
• | the completeness and accuracy of the original bid;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | costs associated with scope changes;
--+-------------------------------------


• | changes in costs of labor and/or materials;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | extended overhead and other costs due to owner, weather and other delays;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | subcontractor performance issues;
--+----------------------------------


• | changes in productivity expectations;
--+--------------------------------------


• | site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes from original design on design-build projects;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a change in the availability and proximity of equipment and materials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to fully and promptly recover on affirmative claims and back charges for additional contract costs; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the customer’s ability to properly administer the contract.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 The ability to realize improvements on project profitability at times is more limited than the risk of lower profitability. For example, design-build contracts carry additional risks such as those associated with design errors and estimating quantities and prices before the project design is completed. We manage this additional risk by including contingencies to our bid amounts, obtaining errors and omissions insurance and obtaining indemnifications from our design consultants where possible. However, there is no guarantee that these risk management strategies will always be successful.
 Most of our contracts, including those with the government, provide for termination at the convenience of the contract owner, with provisions to pay us for work performed through the date of termination. We have not been materially adversely affected by these provisions in the past. Many of our contracts contain provisions that require us to pay liquidated damages if specified completion schedule requirements are not met, and these amounts could be significant.
 We act as prime contractor on most of our construction projects. We complete the majority of our projects with our own resources and subcontract specialized activities such as electrical and mechanical work. As prime contractor, we are responsible for the performance of the entire contract, including subcontract work. Thus, we may be subject to increased costs associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated. Based on our analysis of their construction and financial capabilities, among other criteria, we typically require the subcontractor to furnish a bond or other type of security to guarantee their performance and/or we retain payments in accordance with contract terms until their performance is complete. Disadvantaged business enterprise regulations require us to use our good faith efforts to subcontract a specified portion of contract work done for governmental agencies to certain types of disadvantaged contractors or suppliers. As with all of our subcontractors, some may not be able to obtain surety bonds or other types of performance security.
 Joint Ventures
 We participate in various construction joint ventures of which we are a limited member (“joint ventures”) in order to share expertise, risk and resources for certain highly complex projects. Generally, each construction joint venture is formed as a partnership or limited liability company to accomplish a specific project and is jointly controlled by the joint venture partners. We select our joint venture partners (“partner(s)”) based on our analysis of their construction and financial capabilities, expertise in the type of work to be performed and past working relationships, among other criteria. The joint venture agreements typically provide that our interests in any profits and assets, and our respective share in any losses and liabilities, that may result from the performance of the contract are limited to our stated percentage interest in the project.

7
 

Under each joint venture agreement, one partner is designated as the sponsor. The sponsoring partner typically provides all administrative, accounting and most of the project management support for the project and generally receives a fee from the joint venture for these services. We have been designated as the sponsoring partner in certain of our current joint venture projects and are a non-sponsoring partner in others.
 We consolidate joint ventures where we have determined that through our participation we have a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810, Consolidation, and related standards. Where we have determined we are not the primary beneficiary of a joint venture but do exercise significant influence, we account for our share of the operations of unconsolidated construction joint ventures on a pro rata basis in revenue and cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations and in equity in construction joint ventures in the consolidated balance sheets. We account for non-construction unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures and include our s
hare of the operations in equity in income of affiliates in the consolidated statements of operations and in investment in affiliates in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 We also participate in various “line item” joint venture agreements under which each partner is responsible for performing certain discrete items of the total scope of contracted work. The revenue for these discrete items is defined in the contract with the project owner and each joint venture partner bears the profitability risk associated only with its own work. There is not a single set of books and records for a line item joint venture. Each partner accounts for its items of work individually as it would for any self-performed contract. We account for our portion of these contracts as revenues and cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations and in relevant balances in the consolidated balance sheets.
 The agreements with our partner(s) for both construction joint ventures and line item joint ventures define each partner’s management role and financial responsibility in the project. The amount of operational exposure is generally limited to our stated ownership interest. However, due to the joint and several nature of the performance obligations under the related owner contracts, if any of the partners fail to perform, we and the remaining partners, if any, would be responsible for performance of the outstanding work (i.e., we provide a performance guarantee). We estimate our liability for performance guarantees for our unconsolidated and line item joint ventures and include them in accrued expenses and other current liabilities with a corresponding increase in equity in construction joint ventures in the consolidated balance sheets. We reassess our liability when and if changes in circumstances occur. The liability and corresponding asset are removed from the consolidated balance sheets upon completion and customer acceptance of the project. Circumstances that could lead to a loss under these agreements beyond our stated ownership interest include the failure of a partner to contribute additional funds to the venture in the event the project incurs a loss or additional costs that we could incur should a partner fail to provide the services and resources that it had committed to provide in the agreement. We are not able to estimate amounts that may be required beyond the remaining cost of the work to be performed. These costs could be offset by billings to the customer or by proceeds from our partners’ corporate and/or other guarantees.
 At December 31, 2018, there was $3.1 billion of construction revenue to be recognized on unconsolidated and line item construction joint venture contracts, of which $1.0 billion represented our share and the remaining $2.1 billion represented our partners’ share. See Note 10 of “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for more information.
 Insurance and Bonding
 We maintain general and excess liability, construction equipment, workers’ compensation and medical insurance; all in amounts consistent with industry practice and as part of our overall risk management strategy. Further, our policies are held with financially stable coverage providers, often in a layered or quota share arrangement which reduces the likelihood of an interruption or impact to operations.
 In connection with our business, we generally are required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide an additional measure of security for our performance under certain public and private sector contracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds depends upon our capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise and external factors, including the capacity of the overall surety market. Surety companies consider such factors in light of the amount of our contract backlog that we have currently bonded and their current underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. The capacity of the surety market is subject to market-based fluctuations driven primarily by the level of surety industry losses and the degree of surety market consolidation. When the surety market capacity shrinks it results in higher premiums and increased difficulty obtaining bonding, in particular for larger, more complex projects throughout the market. To help mitigate this risk, we employ a co-surety structure involving three sureties. Although we do not believe that fluctuations in surety market capacity have significantly affected our ability to grow our business, there is no assurance that it will not significantly affect our ability to obtain new contracts in the future (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors”).

Anti-corruption and Bribery 
 We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits U.S. and other business entities from making improper payments to foreign government officials, political parties or political party officials. We are also subject to the applicable anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, thus potentially exposing us to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions. The anti-corruption provisions of the FCPA are enforced by the Department of Justice while other state or federal agencies may seek recourse against the Company for issues related to FCPA. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requires strict compliance with certain accounting and internal control standards set forth under the FCPA. Failure to comply with the FCPA and other laws can expose us and/or individual employees to potentially severe criminal and civil penalties. Such penalties may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We devote resources to the development, maintenance, communication and enforcement of our Code of Conduct, our anti-bribery compliance policies, our internal control processes and compliance related policies. We strive to conduct timely internal investigations of potential violations and take appropriate action depending upon the outcome of the investigation.
 Environmental Regulations
 Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to discharges to air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, the handling of underground storage tanks and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. Certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance and others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, impose strict, retroactive, joint and several liability upon persons responsible for releases of hazardous substances. We continually evaluate whether we must take additional steps at our locations to ensure compliance with environmental laws. While compliance with applicable regulatory requirements has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past, there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future. In addition, our aggregate materials operations require operating permits granted by governmental agencies. We believe that tighter regulations for the protection of the environment and other factors will make it increasingly difficult to obtain new permits and renewal of existing permits may be subject to more restrictive conditions than currently exist.
 The California Air Resource Board requires California equipment owners/operators to reduce diesel particulate and nitrogen oxide emissions from in-use off-road diesel equipment and to meet progressively more restrictive emission targets from 2010 to 2022 by retrofitting equipment with diesel emission control devices or replacing equipment with new engine technology as it becomes available. Over the past few years we have been proactively replacing our fleet prior to the 2022 deadline to be in compliance and do not expect significant future costs.
 As is the case with other companies in our industry, some of our aggregate products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica, a common mineral. Also, some of our construction and material processing operations release, as dust, crystalline silica that is in the materials being handled. Excessive, prolonged inhalation of very small-sized particles of crystalline silica has allegedly been associated with respiratory disease (including Silicosis). During 2016, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) implemented new and more stringent occupational exposure thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust. In addition, the Mine Safety and Health Administration is proposing the identical rule as implemented by OSHA. We have implemented dust control procedures to measure compliance with requisite thresholds and to verify that respiratory protective equipment is made available as necessary. We also communicate, through safety data sheets and other means, what we believe to be appropriate warnings and cautions to employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive, prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors”). The scope of new exposure limits indicates that additional engineering controls, beyond providing respirators will be required to reduce potential exposure in response to the reduced exposure limits. The OSHA General Industry and Construction Standards were phased in during late 2017 and were fully implemented in 2018. Expenses related to this implementation were immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
