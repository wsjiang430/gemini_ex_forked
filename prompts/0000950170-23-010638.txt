 Item 1. Business.

CareMax Inc. (“CareMax” or the “Company”), f/k/a Deerfield Healthcare Technology Acquisitions Corp. (“DFHT”), a Delaware corporation, was originally formed in July 2020 as a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination involving one or more businesses. On December 18, 2020, DFHT entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) with CareMax Medical Group, L.L.C., a Florida limited liability company (“CMG”), the entities listed in Annex I to the Business Combination Agreement (the “CMG Sellers”), IMC Medical Group Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“IMC”), IMC Holdings, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“IMC Parent”), and Deerfield Partners, L.P. Upon completion (the “Closing”) of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement and the related financing transactions on June 8, 2021 (the “Business Combination”), DFHT acquired 100% of the equity interests in CMG and 100% of the equity interests in IMC, with CMG and IMC becoming wholly owned subsidiaries of DFHT, and the name of the combined company was changed to CareMax, Inc. Unless the context otherwise requires, “CareMax”, “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer, for periods prior to the completion of the Business Combination, to CMG and its subsidiaries, and, for periods upon or after the completion of the Business Combination, to CareMax, Inc. and its subsidiaries, together with its affiliated professional corporations or limited liability companies (“affiliated professional contractors”). Certain subsidiaries of CareMax, Inc. have contracts with our affiliated professional contractors, which are separate legal entities that provide physician services.
Overview
 
As of December 31, 2021, CareMax operated 45 multi-specialty medical centers throughout Florida, primarily serving the Medicare Advantage population. In addition, CareMax recently opened two additional medical care centers in Memphis, Tennessee and one additional medical care center in New York City, New York for a total of 48 centers.
 
CareMax’s medical centers offer 24/7 access to care through employed providers and provide a comprehensive suite of high-touch health care and social services to its patients, including primary care, specialty care, telemedicine, health & wellness, optometry, dental, pharmacy and transportation. CareMax’s differentiated healthcare delivery model is focused on care coordination with vertically integrated ambulatory care and community-centric services. The goal of CareMax is to intercede as early as possible to manage chronic conditions for its patient members in a proactive, holistic, and tailored manner to provide a positive influence on patient outcomes and a reduction in overall healthcare costs. CareMax specifically focuses on providing access to high quality care in underserved communities, with approximately 60% of its Medicare Advantage patients being dual-eligible (meaning eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid) and low-income subsidy eligible as of December 31, 2021.
 
While CareMax’s primary focus is providing care to Medicare-eligible seniors who are mostly over the age of 65, CareMax also provides services to children and adults through Medicaid programs as well as through commercial insurance plans. Nearly all of CareMax’s Medicare patients are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan run by private insurance companies on behalf of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). With Medicare Advantage, the patient receives the same coverage as original Medicare, including emergency care, and most plans also include prescription drug coverage. In many cases, Medicare Advantage plans offer even more than original Medicare, including dental, vision, hearing and wellness programs.
 
CareMax’s comprehensive, high touch approach to health care delivery is powered by its CareOptimize technology platform. CareOptimize is a proprietary end-to-end technology platform that aggregates data and analyzes that data using proprietary algorithms and machine learning to support more informed care delivery decisions and to focus care decisions on preventative chronic disease management and the social determinants of health. CareMax believes that CareOptimize is designed to drive better outcomes and lower costs. The CareOptimize technology platform also provides CareMax with a national reach beyond Florida. As of December 31, 2021, the CareOptimize platform was used by approximately 20,000 providers in more than 30 states. CareOptimize was also used by IMC prior to the Business Combination, which has supported the integration and operation of the combined company. CareMax has shifted from selling the CareOptimize platform to new outside customers for a software subscription fee and is instead focused on providing the software to affiliated practices of its managed service organization (“MSO”) to further improve financial, clinical, and quality outcomes from the affiliated providers. As of December of 2021, this MSO serviced more than 100 independent physician associations (“IPAs”).
 

CareMax's Key Differentiators
 
Vertically Integrated Model Provides a “One Stop Shop” Solution.
 
CareMax is focused on serving the Medicare Advantage population, including patients that live in medically underserved communities that face significant social barriers to accessing care. CareMax’s vertically-integrated, one-stop-shop solution is able to break through these barriers by focusing on whole-person health that includes primary care, specialty care, dental, optometry, pharmacy and transportation services, as well as through its wellness centers at each location that offer health educational classes, fitness programs and social services.
 ​
 CareOptimize Proprietary Technology Platform Enables Value Based Care. 

CareMax’s proprietary end-to-end technology platform, CareOptimize, aggregates and analyzes data using proprietary algorithms and machine learning to support point of care guidance and automated interventions. This process is designed to improve provider efficiency by enabling providers to provide consistent and coordinated care while improving outcomes and lowering costs. We believe that the breadth of the installation base of CareOptimize provides insights into which national markets would be a strong fit for CareMax’s medical centers.
 
Value-Based Relationships.

CareMax’s value-based capitation contracts incentivize CareMax to provide high-quality care rather than driving a high volume of services. This has historically resulted in higher unit economics than fee-for-services practices. Because plan premiums are enhanced when a contracted plan achieves high quality scores (STARS program), CareMax is incentivized to deliver high quality of care to its members. In 2021, on a consolidated basis, pro forma for all closed business combinations as of December 31, 2021, CareMax achieved the highest quality rating possible, 5 STARS.
 ​
 Multi-Faceted Growth Initiatives.

CareMax has a history of de novo construction of new medical centers, acquisitions of small practices which are then migrated into existing medical centers, and scaled acquisitions. We believe this history of expansion in our core markets in Florida provides a framework to implement our growth strategies as we seek to further expand our operations in new markets in Florida and other states.
 ​
 MSO Services.

In addition to owned medical centers, CareMax’s MSO services supports IPAs through the CareOptimize software and services. The IPAs allow for growth in new markets that can precede CareMax de novo medical center openings with limited capital outlay. In addition, these IPAs present a pipeline of future acquisitions, with CareMax having acquired four medical practices that were previously within an IPA.
 ​
 Focus on Underserved Communities.
 
CareMax primarily locates medical centers in underserved communities, resulting in a higher number of dual eligible patients (approximately 60% as of December 31, 2021). These markets were historically avoided by primary care providers due to the challenges of working in these communities and the historically lower fee for service rates for government payors, which has reduced competition in many expansion markets. Furthermore, dual eligible patients receive higher reimbursement due to the correlation between socioeconomic status, comorbidities and barriers to care. With CareMax’s Whole Person Health model, CareMax has shown the available economics from effectively treating this population.
 ​
 Affordable Housing Locations.
 
CareMax has piloted a medical center inside an affordable senior housing partnership, which experienced accelerated growth. CareMax intends to continue this strategy both within its existing footprint and expansion markets, including through its collaboration with The Related Companies, L.P. (“Related”), one of the largest private owners of affordable housing in the United States with an affordable housing footprint spanning over 55,000 units in 24 states.
 ​


Medicaid and Commercial patients.
 
CareMax also services Medicaid and commercial patients. This provides an incumbent patient-provider relationship when existing Medicaid and commercial patients turn 65 and receive Medicare, which provides an in-house pipeline of Medicare beneficiaries not available to some peers.
 ​
 Home Health and Mobile Clinic.
 
CareMax’s employed home health providers and mobile clinic service patients in their homes and in the community. This assists with seeing patients who may be unable or unwilling to come to the medical centers, thus allowing CareMax to continue to medically care for these patients. In addition, the mobile clinic provides disaster recovery capabilities to allow patients to continue to be seen should a natural disaster render the medical centers inaccessible.
 ​
 CareMax's Growth Story
 
CareMax’s Growth strategy is based on seeking growth through multiple channels, including:
 
Growth in Existing Clinics. CareMax’s 45 multi-specialty medical centers are located in strategically important Florida markets. According to data published by CMS and the Kaiser Family Foundation ("KFF"), Miami-Dade, Broward, Orange, Osceola, Lake, Seminole and Hillsborough counties have a population of 1.5 million Medicare eligibles, and 1.0 million in Medicare Advantage enrollment, equating to a 63% market penetration for Medicare Advantage as of December 2021. CareMax has approximately 33,500 Medicare Advantage members in its existing centers, which leaves sufficient capacity to double membership in its current centers. Growth in existing centers has historically led to increased financial performance at a center level by positively affecting center margins. For example, CareMax’s centers that opened prior to 2017 have shown an increase in Platform Contribution Margin, which is revenue less external provider costs and cost of care (excluding depreciation and amortization), divided by risk-based revenues, from breakeven at approximately 50% capacity to a 20% Platform Contribution Margin at 70% capacity. With an average capacity of 1,650 patients, our 45 centers as of December 31, 2021 can support approximately 75,000 Medicare-Equivalent Member (“MCREM”) patients. As we add patients to our existing centers, we expect these patients to contribute incremental economics to CareMax as we leverage our fixed cost base at each center. The additional de novo centers we expect to open in 2022 will also increase our capacity. We believe that we currently serve approximately 2% of the total patients in the markets where we currently have centers. As a result, there is significant opportunity to expand in our existing markets through the acquisition of new patients.
 
Open De Novo Clinics in New Markets by Leveraging Strategic Relationships. While CareMax historically operated only in Florida, we recently opened our first medical care center in New York and our first two medical care centers in Tennessee. We also plan to expand in additional markets, including Louisiana. CareMax has entered into a collaboration agreement with Anthem, Inc., a national health benefits company (“Anthem”), through which CareMax plans to open approximately 50 centers across eight priority states. Additionally, CareMax has entered into a collaboration with Related, pursuant to which Related will advise CareMax on opening new medical centers nationwide, including but not limited to within and proximate to affordable housing communities that may be owned by Related.

We estimate that the core addressable market for our services is approximately 1,533,000 Medicare eligible patients in our target demographic. We believe this market represents approximately $18.4 billion of annual healthcare expenditures based on multiplying an average annual revenue of $12,000 per member, which is derived from our experience and industry knowledge and which we believe represents a reasonable assumption, by the number of Medicare eligible patients in our target markets. Our existing market today represent a small fraction of this massive market opportunity. Based upon our experience to date, we believe our innovative care model can scale nationally, and we therefore expect to selectively and strategically expand into new geographies. As we continue this expansion, our success will depend on the competitive dynamics in those markets, and our ability to attract patients and deploy our care model in those markets. Through CareOptimize’s clients, which are spread across more than 30 states, we already understand the healthcare dynamics in communities where we are looking to expand. This gives management a high degree of confidence that the CareMax care model can have similar clinical and financial outcomes as we have seen historically in South Florida in other locations.
 
Expand MSO Network. CareMax’s Five Star Quality Rating and payor agnosticism, coupled with the CareOptimize technology platform, has attracted assignments of additional MSO membership from health plans, health systems and physicians. CareMax expects to continue to pursue expansion of its MSO network to provide a lower cost member acquisition strategy.
 
Execute Opportunistic M&A. Since the Business Combination in June of 2021, CareMax has engaged in strategic M&A activity to expand its footprint and grow its membership base. In connection with the Business Combination, CareMax acquired IMC, which owned and operated 13 medical clinics and wellness centers. Subsequently, CareMax acquired Senior Medical Associates, LLC (“SMA”), which operated 10 medical centers across Broward County, Florida, with approximately 5,000 Medicare Advantage members, the assets

of Unlimited Medical Services of Florida, LLC (“DNF”), which operated six medical centers in the Orlando, Florida, with more than 4,000 Medicare Advantage members, and the assets of Advantis Physician Alliance, LLC (“Advantis”), which operated three medical centers across Hillsborough County, Florida, with approximately 1,000 Medicare Advantage members. In addition, the Company acquired another small practice, which added two additional medical centers. CareMax intends to continue to leverage its existing relationships, including CareOptimize and its MSO, to identify practice acquisition targets that can support growth.
 
Engage in Direct Contracting Strategy. CMS recently began a Direct Contracting Entity model, which is a set of voluntary payment model options that creates three payment model options for participants to take on risk and earn rewards, and provides them with choices related to cash flow, beneficiary alignment, and benefits enhancements. CareMax elected not to participate in Direct Contracting in 2021 due to the infancy of the program (with unclear returns) and over 70% of beneficiaries in Miami Dade County, Florida, are enrolled in Medicare Advantage. For 2022, CareMax contracted with Better Health d/b/a ConcertoCare to utilize its Direct Contracting Entity in exchange for a 1% share of all payments from Medicare. We believe this will allow CareMax to incrementally enter into the novel Direct Contracting program with room to grow based on CareMax’s initial results and also the results of its peers. CareMax is currently exploring whether to apply for the new ACO REACH program, which will be replacing Direct Contracting in 2023.
 
CareMax’s History

Co-founded by Carlos de Solo and Alberto de Solo in 2011, CareMax evolved to serve the needs of Medicare Advantage patients by providing a comprehensive suite of high-touch health care and social services to its patients through its medical centers and technology platform, CareOptimize. Prior to the Business Combination, CareMax owned and operated 11 multi-specialty medical centers throughout Miami-Dade and Broward Counties in South Florida that provide clinical care, ancillary care services, and health and wellness services. CareMax also established a full-risk MSO. As of December of 2021, this MSO serviced more than 100 IPAs.
 
Prior to the Business Combination, IMC owned and operated 13 medical clinics and wellness centers strategically located in Miami-Dade, Broward and Orange Counties in Florida that provide clinical care, ancillary care services and health and wellness services to more than 48,000 members of Medicare Advantage, Medicaid and commercial insurance plans. While IMC’s primary focus was providing care to Medicare-eligible seniors who are mostly over the age of 65, IMC also provided services to children and adults through Medicaid programs as well as through commercial insurance plans.
 
CareOptimize was formed in 2016 as a result of the combination of CareMax with Quirk Healthcare Solutions, which was founded in 2005 by Ben Quirk, Chief Strategy Officer for CareMax and CareOptimize, to develop strategies and systems in support of government initiatives and healthcare trends.

The U.S. Healthcare System
 
Market Overview
 
The senior population of the United States is expected to grow up to five times faster than other segments of the population, with seniors expected to represent approximately 21% of the population by 2030 according to the 2017 National Population Projections based on the U.S. Census. This aging population is expected to drive growth in the already large Medicare market, which was $829.5 billion in 2020, and is projected by CMS to grow at 7.6% per year through 2028. According to CMS, Medicare spending in the United States is projected to outpace overall healthcare spending in the United States, with healthcare representing the largest component of U.S. GDP at approximately 19.7% in 2020. As a result, the penetration of Medicare Advantage programs relative to all other Medicare programs is forecasted to increase to more than 30 million members through 2025, according to CMS. Value-based primary care is recognized as one of the best ways to lower healthcare spending, particularly as Medicare Advantage increases its share of the Medicare market. Value-based, patient-centered medical home models have garnered bipartisan support and are expected to continue to grow in popularity irrespective of changes in presidential administration. CareMax believes that its model of care is poised for growth in the Medicare market.
 
Unsustainable and rising healthcare costs
 
Healthcare spending in the United States reached $4.1 trillion in 2020 according to CMS, representing approximately 19.7% of U.S. GDP, an all-time high or $12,530 per person. National health expenditures are projected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.4% per year from 2019 to 2028 according to CMS, 1.1 percentage points faster than gross domestic product per year on average.
 
Healthcare expenditures are particularly concentrated in the Medicare-eligible population due to the high rate of chronic conditions. While representing only 15% of the United States population, the 65 and older age group accounted for 34% of all healthcare spending in 2014, with an average spend of $19,098 per person, three times higher than for working adults and five times higher than for children.
 

Healthcare expenditures are also particularly high for populations with chronic conditions, such as diabetes and obesity. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, chronic disease accounts for approximately 75% of aggregate healthcare spending in the United States. Two-thirds of the Medicare population lives with two or more chronic health conditions, and treatment of these conditions represents 96% of Medicare spending.
 
Prevalence of wasteful spending and sub-optimal outcomes
 
A 2019 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association estimated that approximately 25% of all healthcare spending is for unnecessary services, excessive administrative costs, fraud and other problems creating waste, implying approximately $760 billion to $935 billion of annual wasteful spending at current levels.
 
In 2020, hospital care accounted for the largest portion of healthcare spending in the United States, representing approximately 31% of the total. Proper management of chronic conditions can significantly reduce the incidence of acute episodes, which are the main drivers of trips to the emergency room and hospitalization, particularly among the elderly. According to CMS, in 2020, approximately 38% of Medicare expenditures (including both Medicare Part A spend and Medicare Part B institutional spend), or approximately $319 billion, were dedicated to hospitalization.

Emergency department overutilization is a common symptom of patients, particularly elderly patients, who often do not understand how to navigate an overly complex healthcare system. Because elderly patients are more likely to have chronic and complex conditions, they are often admitted to the hospital for expensive treatment following these unnecessary emergency room visits.
 
Despite high levels of spending, the United States healthcare system struggles to produce better health outcomes and to keep doctors and patients satisfied. Life expectancy in the United States was 77.0 years in 2020, compared to 82.1 years in comparable developed countries, and patient satisfaction with the healthcare system is low.
 
New payment structures have begun to address the problem
 
Policymakers and healthcare experts generally acknowledge the fundamental challenges and opportunities for improvement in the delivery of healthcare in the United States. Historically, healthcare delivery was centered around reactive care to acute events, which resulted in the development of a fee-for-service payment model. By linking payments to volume of encounters and pricing for higher complexity interventions, the fee-for-service model does not reward prevention, but rather unintentionally incentivizes the treatment of acute care episodes as they occur.
 
Policymakers have taken note of the negative impacts created by the fee-for-service model and have realized that an aging United States population with high prevalence of chronic disease requires a new payment structure. They have responded by creating programs like Medicare Advantage and pushing for transitions to value-based reimbursements.
 
Medicare Advantage
 
Medicare Advantage works as an alternative to traditional fee-for-service Medicare. In Medicare Advantage, CMS pays health plans a monthly sum per member to manage all health expenses of a participating member. This provides the health plans with an incentive to deliver lower-cost, high-quality care.
 
Value-based payments
 
Value-based refers to the goal of incentivizing healthcare providers to simultaneously increase quality while lowering the cost of care. In January 2015, HHS announced a goal of tying 30% and 50% of all Medicare payments to value through alternative payment models by the end of 2016 and 2018, respectively. In addition, while not a policy-setting body, the Health Care Payment Learning & Action Network, an active group of public and private healthcare leaders, indicated in October of 2019 its desire to move 100% of Medicare payments to being tied to value- based care by 2025. Additionally, CMS began using a Direct Contracting Model in 2021 for value-based payment arrangements directly with 53 provider groups for their current Medicare fee-for-service patients similar to the value-based contracts that we enter into with our Medicare Advantage partners. Effective January 2023, ACO REACH program is replacing the Direct Contracting Model.
 
The trend toward value-based payment systems has been supported at both the patient and policymaker level. Medicare Advantage has been well received since it was introduced, with penetration among Medicare beneficiaries increasing from 13% in 2004 to 42% in 2021, according to KFF. By 2030, the Congressional Budget Office projects that Medicare Advantage penetration will increase to approximately 51%.
 

Legacy Healthcare Delivery Infrastructure Has Been Slow to Transition from Reactive and Episodic Care to Proactive and Comprehensive Care Models
 
In order for shifts to value-based payment models to drive meaningful results, there must be a corresponding shift in care delivery models. To date, such care delivery models have been slow to develop. While there has been significant investment by providers, payors and technology companies in developing solutions to drive higher quality and lower cost of care, these investments have not resulted in meaningful change within a healthcare delivery infrastructure that remains optimized for the fee-for-service model.
 
In order to maintain economically viable practices in a fee-for-service payment model, typical primary care providers need to see an ever-increasing number of patients per day with limited support from staff, which limits the time providers are able to spend with each patient during office visits. In addition, financial constraints further limit the ability of primary care providers to invest in technology and other capabilities that would enable them to have more personalized patient engagement and prevent primary care providers from providing their patients with many of the supplemental services that they need, such as home-based primary care, medication management and behavioral health services that are often not reimbursed at a sufficient level to enable providers to offer these services.
 
Many payors have been early adopters of value-based payment models, but their ability to influence the care delivery model is limited. Any particular payor represents a small portion of the average provider’s panel, making it difficult for the payor to gain sufficient provider mindshare to meaningfully influence the way that any one provider delivers care. Some payors attempt to solve this problem by directly investing in provider assets; however, the provider assets available for investment are primarily optimized for the legacy fee-for-service model.
 
There is demand for technology-driven disruption that would shift the healthcare system to a value-based model. However, technology-based solutions alone have been unable to drive significant change without also addressing the constraints on providers’ time and resources.
 
Advancements in technology have disrupted multiple industries when the technology was thoughtfully applied and integrated. These new business models, systems and approaches have replaced legacy offerings and driven significant changes in consumer behavior. We believe that an integrated, value-based care platform enabled by data and technology has the potential to similarly revolutionize the healthcare industry.
 
CareMax Medical centers
 
The foundation of CareMax’s model is its medical centers. A typical medical center ranges in size from approximately 5,250 to 15,000 feet with the capacity for three to five full clinical care teams, depending on size. Each clinical care team can provide high-touch preventive care to up to 600 Medicare Advantage members.
Once fully-staffed with four full clinical care teams, each medical center can provide care to up to 2,400 members. It typically takes about 12 to 18 months to complete the buildout of each medical center and about six more months for each medical center to gain sufficient membership to reach break-even, which typically ranges between 250 and 500 members per center, depending upon payor allocation and capacity of the center.
 
CareMax’s currently operational medical centers are located throughout Miami Dade, Broward, Orange, Osceola, Lake Seminole and Hillsborough counties in Florida and the Company recently opened two medical centers in Memphis, Tennessee and one medical center in New York City, New York. A fleet of approximately 150 vans provides transportation for members between their homes and the medical centers, wellness centers, and other medical appointments outside of the medical center. Medications can be delivered directly to members’ homes from CareMax’s central fill pharmacy, negating the burden of an additional trip to a retail pharmacy for members, which may otherwise provide a barrier to medication compliance. Medical personnel are available to serve members in their homes following discharge from the hospital or if travel to a medical center is burdensome for a member. Each medical center typically includes an optical shop to provide patients with frames and lenses made in-house at the CareMax optical lab, a pharmacy dispensary supplied by CareMax’s owned central fill pharmacy, and nonpharmacological pain management, such as massage therapy and acupuncture, through the wellness center. Almost all of CareMax’s medical centers include health and wellness centers that offer health educational classes, fitness programs, and social services intended to address the social barriers to accessing care faced by many of CareMax’s Medicare Advantage members. In Florida, each wellness center includes an ACCESS center, licensed by the Florida Department of Children and Families, that is able to connect members with additional social services, such as food and housing assistance. Each wellness center typically extends these social services to the surrounding community through community outreach personnel, who host health fairs and events open to non-members. As a result, each CareMax medical center is a “one-stop-shop” health and welfare solution for members.
 
CareMax’s Clinical Care Teams



CareMax utilizes a team-based approach. Each clinical care team is led by a primary care physician, who may work with a physician’s assistant or registered nurse and each of which is supported by a medical assistant to deliver value-based, coordinated care. As a medical center grows, CareMax increases the number of clinical care teams serving members. Each of CareMax’s clinical care teams is trained in preventive and comprehensive care designed to address the whole person and provide a comprehensive, high touch approach to health care delivery.
 
Each of CareMax’s team members has a specific role to play in delivering CareMax’s care model, as described below:
 

Primary Care Physician | Leads the clinical care team and implements CareMax’s comprehensive, high touch approach to health care 
Physician’s Assistant or Registered Nurse Practitioner | Edu cate and manage clinical needs between visits and provide group education on chronic disease management
Medical Assistant | Manage clinical workflows and act as guides for patient visits 

 
Supporting each clinical care team at each center are the following additional care and service providers:
 

Phlebotomist | Front Desk | Access Representative 
Pharmacy Technician | Referral Coordinator | Community Sales Representative 
Administrator | Transportation Dispatches | Wellness Staff & Massage Therapist

 
Additional care and service providers allow members to receive laboratory services, ultrasounds, electrocardiograms, x-rays, and limited procedures, such as joint injections, centrally at a medical center. Specialty providers, ranging from cardiology, dermatology, pulmonology, gastroenterology, podiatry, psychiatry, pain management, optometry, ophthalmology, and dental, are also available to members at each medical center.
 
Additionally, CareMax’s medical centers are supported by a centralized office which contains a 24/7 inbound call center, member outreach outbound call center, referrals processing, medical records and clinical documentation reviewers. Members are guided through the entirety of the healthcare system by referrals and care coordinators who handle the appointment scheduling and medical record retrieval that would otherwise be the responsibility of the member to coordinate, thereby addressing another potential barrier to care for most members.
 
CareOptimize
 
CareOptimize is CareMax’s technology platform that powers its comprehensive, high touch approach to health care delivery. CareOptimize is a proprietary end-to-end technology platform that does the following:
 
 Aggregates Data. CareOptimize collects health-related data from CareMax members and the patients served by healthcare organizations in the CareOptimize network from a broad set of sources, including state level health information exchanges, payor claims data, laboratory results, eligibility data and data gathered from remote monitoring, such as through CareBox. CareOptimize is designed to structure and sort these data sets to develop a comprehensive understanding of member and patient medical and social attributes.
 
 Data Analytics. CareOptimize utilizes proprietary algorithms and machine learning to support more informed care delivery decisions and to focus care decisions on preventative chronic disease management and the social determinants of health. CareMax uses these analytics and data science to generate insights that CareMax and the healthcare organizations in the CareOptimize network use in care decisions for members and patients.
 
​  Informed Care Decisions. Based on the data and analysis, CareOptimize saves time for providers and improves the consistent and coordinated application of care delivery;
 
 CareOptimize offers providers curated patient data accessible by providers during office visits, which allows providers to review medical histories more easily, identify relevant data points, and reduce the administrative burden of the practice of medicine;
 
 CareOptimize alerts providers to changes in conditions between visits, making interventions between visits possible without the need for a patient to contact the provider, thereby reducing another potential barrier for care;
 
 CareOptimize will identify where a patient may have not yet completed preventative tests;
 
 CareOptimize helps providers to identify specialists convenient to patients’ geography; and



 CareOptimize may identify care events, such as hospitalizations, or other care provided outside the care network, to give providers a complete picture of a patients’ medical status.
 
As a result, CareOptimize stratifies risk for providers and helps providers build meaningful relationships with patients.
 
CareMax’s Impact
 
For CareMax’s Medicare Advantage members, many of whom suffer from one or more chronic conditions and are dual-eligible and low-income subsidy eligible, CareMax’s vertically integrated ambulatory care and community-centric services provides coordinated care and better health outcomes.
 
CareMax believes that the benefit of its vertically integrated ambulatory care and community-centric services became apparent during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. While other healthcare organizations experienced significant loss of fee-for-service revenue from declines in in-person visits, CareMax was able to convert 90% of in-person visits to real-time audio/video telehealth sessions. Where members faced technological barriers to accessing telehealth, CareMax provided tablets to those members. In order to support continued in-person visits, all CareMax employees, staff and members were provided with personal protective equipment and other medical supplies. CareMax clinical teams were also staggered with alternating schedules and staffing redundancies to prevent disruption in member care in the event of an employee infection. Consistent with CareMax’s commitment to whole person wellness, during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, CareMax coordinated a number of social supports for members, including the delivery of over 2,300 meals to members per day, weekly check-in calls to members that also supported COVID-19 related education and virtual exercise and wellness classes and virtual social activities to reduce member loneliness and maintain community among members.
 
Capitation arrangements
 
From its founding, CareMax has focused its business on Medicare Advantage or similar capitation arrangements, which CareMax believes aligns provider incentives with both quality and efficiency of care. Under capitation arrangements, payors pay a fixed per patient per month (“PPPM”) amount for every plan member that selects CareMax as its primary care provider. Each member who selects CareMax as primary thus becomes a patient, giving CareMax a significant portion of the responsibility and risk for managing patient care. CareMax believes this approach to care management improves the quality of care for patients and the potential profitability for efficient care providers.
 
The PPPM rates for CareMax’s capitation arrangements are determined as a percent of the premium the Medicare Advantage plan receives from CMS for CareMax’s at-risk patients. Those premiums are determined via the Medicare Advantage plans’ competitive bidding process with CMS and are based upon the cost of care in a local market and the average utilization of services by the patients enrolled. Medicare pays capitation using a “risk adjustment model,” which compensates providers based on health status (acuity) of each individual patient. Payors with higher acuity patients receive more, and those with lower acuity patients receive less. Under the risk adjustment model, capitation is paid on an interim basis based on enrollee data submitted for the preceding year and is adjusted in subsequent periods after the final data is compiled. As premiums are adjusted via the risk adjustment model, CareMax’s PPPM payments will change in unison with how CareMax’s payors’ premiums change with CMS. In certain contracts, PPPM fees also include adjustments for items such as performance incentives or penalties based on the achievement of certain clinical quality metrics as contracted with payors.
 
Following the Business Combination, CareMax also serves Medicaid patients under capitation arrangements. Similar to the capitation arrangements with Medicare Advantage plans, under Medicaid plans, CareMax is allocated an agreed percentage of the premium the Medicaid plan receives from Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration (“AHCA”). Premiums are determined by Florida’s AHCA and base rates are adjusted annually using historical utilization data projected forward by a third-party actuarial firm. The rates are established based on specific cohorts by age and sex and geographical location. AHCA uses a “zero sum” risk adjustment model that establishes acuity for certain cohorts of patients and quarterly, depending on the scoring of that acuity, may shift premiums from health plans with lower acuity members to health plans with higher acuity members.
 
The premiums paid under capitation are often higher than under fee-for-service arrangements.
 Consequently, the revenue and, when costs for providing service are effectively managed, profit opportunity available under a capitation arrangement are more attractive.
 
CareMax believes that the advantages, savings and efficiencies made possible by the capitation model are most pronounced when the care demands of the population are the most severe and require the most coordination, such as for older patients and patients with chronic, complex and follow-on diseases that CareMax serves. While organized coordination of care is central to the capitation model,

it is also well suited to the implementation of preventive care and disease management over the long term. The capitation model gives practitioners a financial incentive to control costs by improving the overall health of their patient population by managing chronic conditions, offering preventive care and avoiding expensive hospital stays and emergency department visits. Although capitation arrangements involve a certain degree of risk that patients’ medical expenses will exceed the capitation amount, CareMax believes that it has the scale, comprehensive medical delivery resources, infrastructure and care management knowledge to spread this risk across a large patient population. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — Under most of our agreements with health plans, we assume some or all of the risk that the cost of providing services will exceed our compensation.”
 
Fee-for-service arrangements
 
Under traditional fee-for-service reimbursement models, payors pay a specified amount for each service or procedure performed during a patient visit. As a result, compensation under fee-for-service arrangements is closely tied to the volume of patient visits and procedures performed, thus offering limited financial incentive to focus on cost containment and preventative care. As of December 31, 2021, less than 1% of CareMax’s revenue was derived from fee-for-service arrangements.
 
Payor Relationships
 
CareMax’s ability to consistently attract patients across multiple geographic markets depends on its ability to contract with payors in each market. By opening centers in locations where CareMax’s current payors have large numbers of insured Medicare members, CareMax believes it is creating net benefits for payors, as CareMax is able to reduce unnecessary costs and consistently raise the quality of the payors’ plans, driving Medicare quality bonuses that increase their revenue.
 
As of December 31, 2021, CareMax had contractual relationships with 30 payors. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — Our revenues and operations are dependent upon a limited number of key payors, the loss of any of which could adversely affect our business.” While length of contract and economic terms are often negotiated, payors generally use form contracts that contain usual and customary terms and conditions. CareMax’s contracts with payors provide for terms of varying lengths with annual renewals following the initial term; however, certain of these payor contracts also permit the payor to terminate the contract for convenience upon 60 to 90 days’ notice to CareMax. CareMax’s agreements with each payor may also include terms and conditions to incentivize CareMax and facilitate its ability to provide quality care to that plan’s members, such as care coordination or stabilization fees, quality adjustments, marketing support and other usual and customary provisions.
 
The contracts governing CareMax’s relationships with payors include key terms which may include the period of performance, revenue rates, advanced billing terms, service level agreements, termination clauses and right of first refusal clauses. Typically, these contracts provide for a monthly PPPM payment to CareMax determined as a percentage of the Medicare Advantage premium received by the applicable plan. The specified percentage varies depending on the plan and the terms of the particular contract. In some cases, CareMax’s contracts also include other shared medical savings arrangements. In addition, certain of CareMax’s contracts provide that if CareMax fails to meet specified implementation targets, it may be subject to financial penalties.
 
Most of CareMax’s contracts include cure periods for certain breaches, during which time CareMax may attempt to resolve any issues that would trigger a payor’s ability to terminate the contract. Certain of CareMax’s contracts may be terminated immediately by the payor if CareMax loses applicable licenses, goes bankrupt, loses liability insurance, becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy or receives an exclusion, suspension or debarment from state or federal government authorities. Additionally, if a payor were to lose applicable licenses, go bankrupt, lose liability insurance, become insolvent, file for bankruptcy or receive an exclusion, suspension or debarment from state or federal government authorities, CareMax’s contract with such payor could in effect be terminated. The loss, termination or renegotiation of any contract could negatively impact CareMax’s results. In addition, as payors’ businesses respond to market dynamics and financial pressures, and as they make strategic business decisions in respect of the lines of business they pursue and programs in which they participate, CareMax expects that certain of its payors will, from time to time, seek to restructure their agreements with CareMax. See “Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — The termination or non-renewal of the Medicare Advantage (“MA”) contracts held by the health plans with which we contract, or the termination or non-renewal of our contracts with those plans, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and our results of operations.” The contracts with CareMax’s payors impose other obligations on CareMax. For example, CareMax typically agrees that all services provided under the payor contract and all employees providing such services will comply with the payor’s policies and procedures. In addition, in most instances, CareMax has agreed to indemnify CareMax’s payors against certain third-party claims, which may include claims that CareMax’s services infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties.
 
Regulation
 
CareMax’s operations and those of its affiliated physician entities are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations require CareMax to meet various standards relating to, among other things, billings and

reports to government payment programs, primary care medical centers and equipment, dispensing of pharmaceuticals, management of centers, personnel qualifications, maintenance of proper records, and quality assurance programs and patient care. If any of CareMax’s operations or those of its affiliated physicians are found to violate applicable laws or regulations, CareMax could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on CareMax’s business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price, including:
 
 suspension or termination of CareMax’s participation in government and/or private payment programs;
 
 refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable payment program requirements dating back to the applicable statute of limitation periods;
 
 loss of CareMax’s licenses required to operate healthcare facilities or administer pharmaceuticals in the jurisdictions in which CareMax operates;
 
 criminal or civil liability, fines, damages or monetary penalties for violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, Civil Monetary Penalties Law of the Social Security Act, Stark Law, the federal False Claims Act (the “FCA”) and/or state analogs to these federal enforcement authorities, or other regulatory requirements;
 
 enforcement actions by governmental agencies and/or state law claims for monetary damages by patients who believe their health information has been used, disclosed or not properly safeguarded in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws, including with respect to violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by Subtitle D of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, also known as Title XIII of Division A and Title IV of Division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and the regulations promulgated thereunder;
 
 mandated changes to CareMax’s practices or procedures that significantly increase operating expenses or decrease CareMax’s revenue;
 
 imposition of and compliance with corporate integrity agreements that could subject CareMax to ongoing audits and reporting requirements as well as increased scrutiny of CareMax’s billing and business practices which could lead to potential fines, among other things;
 
 termination of various relationships and/or contracts related to CareMax’s business, including joint venture arrangements, contracts with payors, real estate leases and provider employment arrangements;
 
 changes in and reinterpretation of rules and laws by a regulatory agency or court, such as state corporate practice of medicine laws, that could affect the structure and management of CareMax’s business and its affiliated physician practice corporations;
 
 negative adjustments to government payment models including, but not limited to, Medicare Parts A, B and C and Medicaid; and
 
 harm to CareMax’s reputation, which could negatively impact CareMax’s business relationships, the terms of payor contracts, CareMax’s ability to attract and retain patients and physicians, CareMax’s ability to obtain financing and CareMax’s access to new business opportunities, among other things.
 
CareMax expects that CareMax’s industry will continue to be subject to substantial regulation, the scope and effect of which are difficult to predict. CareMax’s activities could be subject to investigations, audits and inquiries by various government and regulatory agencies and private payors with whom CareMax contracts at any time in the future. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Regulation.” Adverse findings from such investigations and audits could bring severe consequences that could have a material adverse effect on CareMax’s business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price. In addition, private payors could require pre-payment audits of claims, which can negatively affect cash flow, or terminate contracts for repeated deficiencies.
 
There is no requirement in the jurisdictions in which CareMax currently operates for a risk-bearing provider to register as an insurance company and CareMax has not registered as such in any of the jurisdictions in which CareMax currently operates, however, CareMax anticipates that such registration will be required in certain of CareMax’s planned expansion markets.
 

Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
 
Federal civil and criminal penalties may be imposed violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include imprisonment, fines and exclusion of the provider from future participation in the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are punishable by imprisonment for up to ten years, fines of up to $100,000 per kickback or both. Larger fines can be imposed upon corporations under the provisions of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the Alternate Fines Statute. Individuals and entities convicted of violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are subject to mandatory exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs for a minimum of five years. Civil penalties for violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute include up to $100,000 in monetary penalties per violation, repayments of up to three times the total payments between the parties to the arrangement and suspension from future participation in Medicare and Medicaid. Court decisions have held that the statute may be violated even if only one purpose of remuneration is to induce referrals. The Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to clarify that a defendant does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or have the specific intent to violate it. In addition, the ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that any claims for items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may be considered false or fraudulent for purposes of the FCA, as discussed below.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute includes statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that protect certain arrangements. Compliance with these exceptions and safe harbors are voluntary. Business transactions and arrangements that are structured to comply fully with an applicable safe harbor will generally be considered outside the ambit of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. However, transactions and arrangements that do not satisfy all elements of a relevant safe harbor do not necessarily violate the law. When an arrangement does not satisfy a safe harbor, the arrangement must be evaluated on a facts and circumstances basis in light of the parties’ intent and the arrangement’s potential for abuse. Arrangements that do not satisfy a safe harbor may be subject to greater scrutiny by enforcement agencies. If any of CareMax’s business transactions or arrangements were found to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, CareMax could face, among other things, criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other state and federal healthcare programs. Any findings that CareMax has violated these laws, or even accusations of the same, could have a material adverse impact on CareMax’s business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price.
 
As part of HHS’s Regulatory Sprint to Coordinated Care (“Regulatory Sprint”), the Office of Inspector General (the “OIG”) of HHS issued a request for information in August 2018 seeking input on regulatory provisions that may act as barriers to coordinated care or value-based care. Specifically, the OIG sought to identify ways in which it might modify or add new safe harbors to the Anti-Kickback Statute (as well as exceptions to the definition of “remuneration” in the beneficiary inducements provision of the Civil Monetary Penalty statute) to foster arrangements that promote care coordination and advance the delivery of value-based care, while also protecting against harms caused by fraud and abuse. Numerous federal agencies have requested comments and information from the public and have published proposed regulations as part of the Regulatory Sprint on areas that have historically been viewed as barriers to innovative care coordination arrangements.
 
On November 20, 2020, the OIG released final rules clarifying and revising the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors. The new rules are intended to reduce regulatory barriers, accelerate the shift in service reimbursement from volume to value-based payments, and advance coordinated care across healthcare settings. OIG’s final rule adds seven new safe harbor provisions for certain coordinated care and value- based arrangements, modifies four existing safe harbor protections, and codifies one new exception under the civil monetary penalty prohibitions against beneficiary inducements related to telehealth technologies furnished to certain in-home dialysis patients.
 
In coordination with the exceptions under the Stark Law, OIG established three “new safe harbors for remuneration exchanged between or among participants in a value-based arrangement.” OIG also finalized a new safe harbor related to patient engagement tools and supports furnished by a participant in a value-based enterprise to a patient in a target patient population, and a safe harbor for participants in CMS-sponsored model arrangements and model patient incentives (e.g., Medicare Shared Savings Program) to provide greater predictability and uniformity across models. The other safe harbor provisions include cybersecurity technology, tools, and related services, and electronic health records (“EHR”) items and services, along with revisions to safe harbors addressing personal services arrangements, warranties, and local transportation.
 
These changes in federal regulations are anticipated to make a significant impact on health care providers and other stakeholders. These and similar changes may cause OIG, CMS or other regulators to change the parameters of rules and regulations that CareMax must follow and thus impact CareMax’s business, results of operations and financial condition.



Risk Bearing Provider Regulation
 
Certain of the jurisdictions where CareMax currently operates or may choose to operate in the future regulate the operations and financial condition of risk bearing providers like CareMax and its affiliated providers. These regulations can include capital requirements, licensing or certification, governance controls and other similar matters. While these regulations have not had a material impact on CareMax’s business to date, as CareMax continues to expand, these rules may require additional resources and capitalization and add complexity to CareMax’s business.
Stark Law
 
The Stark Law prohibits a physician who has a financial relationship, or who has an immediate family member who has a financial relationship, with entities providing Designated Health Services (“DHS”) from referring Medicare patients to such entities for the furnishing of DHS, unless an exception applies.
 
Although uncertainty exists, federal agencies and at least two courts have taken the position that the Stark Law also applies to Medicaid. DHS is defined to include clinical laboratory services, physical therapy services, occupational therapy services, radiology services including magnetic resonance imaging, computerized axial tomography scans, and ultrasound services, radiation therapy services and supplies, durable medical equipment and supplies, parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment, and supplies, prosthetics, orthotics and prosthetic devices and supplies, home health services, outpatient prescription drugs, inpatient and outpatient hospital services and outpatient speech-language pathology services. The types of financial arrangements between a physician and an entity providing DHS that trigger the self-referral prohibitions of the Stark Law are broad and include direct and indirect ownership and investment interests and compensation arrangements. The prohibition applies regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. Unlike the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law is a strict liability violation where unlawful intent need not be demonstrated.
 
The Stark Law prohibits any entity providing DHS that has received a prohibited referral from presenting, or causing to be presented, a claim or billing for the services arising out of the prohibited referral. Similarly, the Stark Law prohibits an entity from “furnishing” a DHS to another entity in which it has a financial relationship when that entity bills for the service. The Stark Law also prohibits self-referrals within an organization by its own physicians, although broad exceptions exist that cover employed physicians and those referring DHS that are ancillary to the physician’s practice to the physician group.
 
If the Stark Law is implicated, the financial relationship must fully satisfy a Stark Law exception. There are a number of exceptions to the self-referral prohibition, including exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, such as employment contracts, leases, professional services agreements, and risk sharing arrangements, amongst others. If an exception is not satisfied, then the parties to the arrangement could be subject to sanctions. Sanctions for violation of the Stark Law include denial of payment for claims for services provided in violation of the prohibition, refunds of amounts collected in violation of the prohibition, a civil penalty of up to $15,000 for each service arising out of the prohibited referral, a civil penalty of up to $100,000 against parties that enter into a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law prohibition, civil assessment of up to three times the amount claimed and potential exclusion from the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Amounts collected on claims related to prohibited referrals must be reported and refunded generally within 60 days after the date on which the overpayment was identified. Furthermore, Stark Law violations and failure to return overpayments in a timely manner can form the basis for FCA liability, as discussed below.
 
If CMS or other regulatory or enforcement authorities determine that claims have been submitted for referrals by CareMax that violate the Stark Law, CareMax would be subject to the penalties described above. In addition, it might be necessary to restructure existing compensation agreements with CareMax’s physicians. Any such penalties and restructuring or other required actions (including mere accusations) could have a material adverse effect on CareMax’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 
In 2018, CMS issued a request for information seeking input on how to address any undue regulatory impact and burden of the Stark Law. CMS placed the request for information in the context of the Regulatory Sprint and stated that it identified aspects of the Stark Law that pose potential barriers to coordinated care. CMS has since issued a sweeping set of new regulations that introduce significant new value-based terminology, safe harbors and exceptions to the Stark Law. Those or other changes implemented by CMS may change the parameters of Stark Law exceptions that CareMax relies on and thus impact CareMax’s business, results of operations and financial condition. On November 20, 2020, CMS and OIG issued new exceptions to promote coordinated services among healthcare providers and emphasize value-based payment and collaborative care. In the final rule, CMS finalized three new exceptions and definitions for certain value-based compensation arrangements between or among physicians, providers and suppliers, and amended the existing exception for EHR items. When it comes to value-based arrangements, CMS codified three “new, permanent exceptions to the physician self-referral law.” The specific activities of the parties involved in these compensation relationships will be key to determining whether the proposed value-based arrangement qualifies for an exception under the Stark Law.
 

CMS also added two new exceptions — one for certain arrangements under which a physician receives limited remuneration for items or services actually provided by the physician, and the other, aligned with OIG, for donations of cybersecurity technology that includes hardware, software, and related services. The final rule also includes commentary and insight into how CMS now interprets numerous defined terms and various requirements scattered throughout the Stark Law.
 
The definition of DHS under the Stark Law does not include physician services. Because most services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries provided in CareMax’s centers are physician services, CareMax’s services generally do not implicate the Stark Law referral prohibition. However, certain ancillary services CareMax may provide, including certain diagnostic testing, may be considered DHS. CareMax also refers Medicare beneficiaries to third parties for the provision of DHS and CareMax’s financial relationships with those third parties must satisfy a Stark Law exception.
 
CareMax has entered into several types of financial relationships with physicians, including compensation arrangements. If CareMax’s centers were to bill for a DHS service and the financial relationships with the physician did not satisfy an exception, CareMax could be required to change CareMax’s practices, face civil penalties, pay substantial fines, return certain payments received from Medicare and beneficiaries or otherwise experience a material adverse effect as a result of a challenge to payments made pursuant to referrals from these physicians under the Stark Law.
 
Fraud and Abuse under State Law
 
States also have laws similar to or more strict than the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and Stark Law that may affect CareMax’s ability to receive referrals from physicians with whom CareMax has financial relationships. State laws of this nature are significant, particularly if they apply to all payors and not just to government-funded healthcare programs. Some states have laws prohibiting physicians from holding financial interests in various types of medical facilities to which they refer patients. These state prohibitions may differ from the Stark Law’s prohibitions and exceptions may apply to a broader or narrower range of services and financial relationships. Some of these laws could potentially be interpreted broadly as prohibiting physicians who hold shares of CareMax’s publicly traded stock or are physician owners from referring patients to CareMax’s centers if the centers perform services for their patients or do not otherwise satisfy an exception to the law. State statutes and regulations also may require physicians or other healthcare professionals to disclose to patients any financial relationship the physicians or healthcare professionals have with a healthcare provider that is recommended to patients.
 
Some state anti-kickback laws include civil and criminal penalties. Some of these laws include exemptions that may be applicable to CareMax’s physician relationships or for financial interests limited to shares of publicly traded stock. Some, however, may include no explicit exemption for certain types of agreements and/or relationships entered into with physicians. These laws and regulations vary significantly from state to state, are often vague and, in many cases, have not been interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies. Exclusions and penalties, if applied to us, could result in significant loss of reimbursement to us, thereby significantly affecting CareMax’s financial condition.
 
If these laws are interpreted to apply to physicians who hold equity interests in CareMax’s centers or to physicians who hold CareMax’s publicly traded stock, and for which no applicable exception exists, CareMax may be required to terminate or restructure CareMax’s relationships with these physicians. Violations of these state laws may result in prohibition of payment for services rendered, loss of licenses, fines, criminal penalties, administrative sanctions, refund requirements and exclusions from government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, which could have a material adverse effect on CareMax’s business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price.
 
Similarly, states may have beneficiary inducement prohibitions and consumer protection laws that may be triggered by the offering of inducements, incentives and other forms of remuneration to patients and prospective patients. Violations range from civil to criminal and could have a material adverse effect on CareMax’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting
 
The laws and regulations relating to the practice of medicine vary from state to state and many states prohibit general business corporations, such as CareMax, from practicing medicine, employing physicians to practice medicine, controlling physicians’ medical decisions or engaging in some practices such as splitting professional fees with physicians. While CareMax believes that it is in substantial compliance with state laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting, other parties may assert that CareMax is engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or unlawful fee-splitting. Were such allegations to be asserted successfully before the appropriate judicial or administrative forums, CareMax could be subject to adverse judicial or administrative penalties, certain contracts could be determined to be unenforceable and CareMax may be required to restructure CareMax’s contractual arrangements. The laws of other states do not prohibit non-physician entities from employing physicians to practice medicine but may retain a ban on some types of fee-splitting arrangements.



Violations of the corporate practice of medicine vary by state and may result in physicians being subject to disciplinary action, as well as to forfeiture of revenues from payors for services rendered. For lay entities, violations may also bring both civil and, in more extreme cases, criminal liability for engaging in medical practice without a license. Some of the relevant laws, regulations and agency interpretations in states with corporate practice of medicine restrictions have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation. In limited cases, courts have required management services companies to divest or reorganize structures deemed to violate corporate practice restrictions. Third-party payors may also seek to terminate their contracts with, or recoup past amounts paid from, CareMax arising out of CareMax’s alleged violation corporate practice or fee-splitting laws. Moreover, state laws are subject to change. Any allegations or findings that CareMax has violated these laws could have a material adverse impact on CareMax’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
The False Claims Act
 
The FCA is a means of policing false bills or false requests for payment in the healthcare delivery system. Among other things, the FCA authorizes the imposition of up to three times the government’s damages and significant per claim civil penalties on any “person” ​(including an individual, organization or company) who, among other acts:
 
 knowingly presents or causes to be presented to the federal government a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval;
 
 knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim;
 
 knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay the government, or knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or
 
 conspires to commit the above acts.
 
The federal government has used the FCA to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and fraud allegedly perpetrated against Medicare and state healthcare programs, including but not limited to coding errors, billing for services not rendered, the submission of false cost or other reports, billing for services at a higher payment rate than appropriate, billing for items or services provided by entities or individuals that are not appropriate licensed, billing for care that is not considered medically necessary and false reporting of risk-adjusted diagnostic codes to Medicare Advantage plans. The penalties for a violation of the FCA range from $5,500 to $11,000 (adjusted for inflation) for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages caused by each false claim, which can be as much as the amounts received directly or indirectly from the government for each such false claim. On June 20, 2020, the Department of Justice issued a final rule announcing adjustments to FCA penalties, under which the per claim penalty range increased to a range from $11,665 to $23,331 for penalties assessed after June 19, 2020, so long as the underlying conduct occurred after November 2, 2015.
 
The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act (“FERA”), enacted on May 20, 2009, greatly expanded the reach of the FCA by eliminating the prior requirement that a false claim be presented to a federal official, or that such a claim directly involve federal funds. FERA clarifies that liability attaches whenever an individual or entity makes a false claim to obtain money or property, any part of which is provided by the government, without regard to whether the individual or entity makes such claim directly to the federal government. Consequently, under FERA, liability attaches when such false claim is submitted to an agent acting on the government’s behalf or with a third party contractor, grantee or other recipient of such federal money or property. Additionally, under FERA, individuals and entities violate the FCA by knowingly retaining historic improper payments (overpayments/overprovisions) even if the individual or entity did not make claim for such payments. The ACA requires that overpayments be reported and returned within 60 days after the overpayment is identified or the corresponding cost report was due.
 
An overpayment impermissibly retained could subject CareMax to liability under the FCA, exclusion from government healthcare programs and penalties under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty statute. As a result of these provisions, CareMax’s procedures for identifying and processing overpayments may be subject to greater scrutiny.
 
In addition to actions being brought under the FCA by government officials, the FCA also allows a private individual with direct knowledge of fraud to bring a whistleblower, or qui tam, lawsuit on behalf of the government for violations of the FCA. The ACA also broadens the direct knowledge requirement so that the private individual is not required to have direct knowledge of the allegations, but must provide information to the government before it is publicly disclosed and that is independent of and materially adds to any publicly disclosed allegations. In that event, the whistleblower is responsible for initiating a lawsuit that sets in motion a chain of events that may eventually lead to the recovery of money by the government.
 

The ACA provides that claims tainted by a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false for purposes of the FCA. Some courts have held that filing claims or failing to refund amounts collected in violation of the Stark Law can form the basis for liability under the FCA. In addition to the provisions of the FCA, which provide for civil enforcement, the federal government can use several criminal statutes to prosecute individuals and entities who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. Any allegations or findings that CareMax has violated the FCA could have a material adverse impact on CareMax’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
In addition to the FCA, various states have adopted their own analogs of the FCA. States are becoming increasingly active in using their false claims laws to police the same activities listed above, particularly with regard to Medicaid fee-for-service and Managed Medicaid programs.
 
Civil Monetary Penalties Statute
 
The Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a, authorizes the imposition of civil monetary penalties, assessments and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a variety of prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to:
 
 presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that the individual or entity knows or should know are for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent;
 
 offering remuneration to a federal health care program beneficiary that the individual or entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive health care items or services from a particular provider;
 
 arranging contracts with an entity or individual excluded from participation in the federal health care programs;
 
 violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute;
 
 making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim for payment for items and services furnished under a federal health care program;
 
 making, using or causing to be made any false statement, omission or misrepresentation of a material fact in any application, bid or contract to participate or enroll as a provider of services or a supplier under a federal health care program; and
 
 failing to report and return an overpayment owed to the federal government.
 
Substantial civil monetary penalties may be imposed under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Statute and may vary depending on the underlying violation. In addition, an assessment of not more than three times the total amount claimed for each item or service may also apply and a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal and state health care programs. In addition, exclusion from the Medicare program may be imposed for violations.
 
CareMax could be exposed to a wide range of allegations to which the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Statute would apply. CareMax performs monthly checks on CareMax’s employees, affiliated providers and certain affiliates and vendors using government databases to confirm that these individuals have not been excluded from federal programs. However, should an individual become excluded and CareMax fails to detect it, a federal agency could require CareMax to refund amounts attributable to all claims or services performed or sufficiently linked to an excluded individual, assess significant penalties or, worse case scenario, exclude CareMax from participating in the Medicare program. Likewise, CareMax’s patient programs, which can include enhancements, incentives, benefits and additional care coordination not otherwise covered by third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid), could be alleged to be intended to influence the patient’s choice in obtaining services or the amount or types of services sought. Thus, CareMax cannot foreclose the possibility that CareMax will face allegations subject to the Civil Monetary Penalty Statute with the potential for a material adverse impact on CareMax’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
HIPAA and Other Data Privacy Laws
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by as amended by Subtitle D of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, also known as Title XIII of Division A and Title IV of Division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, collectively “HIPAA”, as well as a number of other federal and state privacy and information security laws, extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information,” or “PHI” and require covered entities, including health plans and most health care providers, to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Additional security requirements apply to electronic PHI. These regulations also provide patients with substantive rights with respect to

their health information. As a HIPAA covered entity, CareMax is required to enter into written agreements with certain contractors, known as business associates, to whom CareMax discloses PHI. Covered entities may be subject to penalties for, among other activities, failing to enter into a business associate agreement where required by law or as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity and acting within the scope of the agency. In instances where CareMax acts as a business associate to a covered entity, there is the potential for additional liability beyond CareMax’s status as a covered entity.
 
Covered entities must notify affected individuals of breaches of unsecured PHI without unreasonable delay but no later than 60 days after discovery of the breach by a covered entity or its agents. Reporting must also be made to the HHS Office for Civil Rights and, for breaches of unsecured PHI involving more than 500 residents of a state or jurisdiction, to the media. All impermissible uses or disclosures of unsecured PHI are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the PHI has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require CareMax to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving personal information without regard to the probability of the information being compromised.
 
Violations of HIPAA by providers like CareMax, including, but not limited to, failing to implement appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, have resulted in enforcement actions and in some cases triggered settlement payments or civil monetary penalties. Penalties for impermissible use or disclosure of PHI were increased by the HITECH Act by imposing tiered penalties of more than $50,000 per violation and up to $1.5 million per year for identical violations. In addition, HIPAA provides for criminal penalties of up to $250,000 and ten years in prison, with the severest penalties for obtaining and disclosing PHI with the intent to sell, transfer or use such information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm. Further, state attorneys general may bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. CareMax follows and maintains a HIPAA compliance plan, which CareMax believes complies with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations, but there can be no assurance that OCR or other regulators will agree. There can be no assurance that CareMax will not be the subject of an investigation (arising out of a reportable breach incident, audit or otherwise) alleging non-compliance with HIPAA regulations in CareMax’s maintenance of PHI. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations impose and will continue to impose significant costs on CareMax in order to comply with these standards.
 
In addition, certain states have proposed or enacted legislation that will create new data privacy and security obligations for certain entities, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act that went into effect January 1, 2020.
 
In addition, there are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security concerns and CareMax remains subject to federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to alleged privacy and data security violations. The California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which came into effect January 1, 2020, was recently amended and expanded by the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) passed on November 3, 2020. Most of the CPRA’s substantive provisions will not take effect until January 1, 2023, however, the CPRA’s expansion of the “Right to Know” impacts personal information collected on or after January 1, 2022. Companies must still comply with the CCPA during the ramp up period before the CPRA goes into effect. The CCPA and CPRA, among other things, create new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also created a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. It remains unclear what, if any, additional modifications will be made to the CPRA by the California legislature or how it will be interpreted.
 
In addition to the laws discussed above, CareMax may see more stringent state and federal privacy legislation in 2021 and beyond, as the increased cyber-attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic have once again put a spotlight on data privacy and security in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. CareMax cannot predict where new legislation might arise, the scope of such legislation, or the potential impact to CareMax’s business and operations.
 
HIPAA also created two federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 
Healthcare reform
 
In March 2010, broad healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the United States through the ACA. Although many of the provisions of the ACA did not take effect immediately and continue to be implemented, and some have been and may be modified before or during their implementation, the reforms could continue to have an impact on CareMax’s business in a number of ways. CareMax cannot

predict how employers, private payors or persons buying insurance might react to federal and state healthcare reform legislation, whether already enacted or enacted in the future, nor can CareMax predict what form many of these regulations will take before implementation.
 
Other aspects of the 2010 healthcare reform laws may also affect CareMax’s business, including provisions that impact the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These and other provisions of the ACA remain subject to ongoing uncertainty due to developing regulations and clarifications, including those described above, as well as continuing political and legal challenges at both the federal and state levels.
 
While there may be significant changes to the healthcare environment in the future, the specific changes and their timing are not yet apparent. As a result, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the future with respect to the exchanges and other core aspects of the current health care marketplace. Future elections may create conditions for Congress to adopt new federal coverage programs that may disrupt CareMax’s current commercial payor revenue streams. While specific changes and their timing are not yet apparent, such changes could lower CareMax’s reimbursement rates or increase CareMax’s expenses. Any failure to successfully implement strategic initiatives that respond to future legislative, regulatory, and executive changes could have a material adverse effect on CareMax’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
CMS and state Medicaid agencies also routinely adjust the risk adjustment factor which is central to payment under Medicare Advantage and Managed Medicaid programs in which CareMax participates. The monetary “coefficient” values associated with diseases that CareMax manages in its population are subject to change by CMS and state agencies. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on CareMax’s financial condition.
 
Other regulations
 
CareMax’s operations are subject to various state hazardous waste and non-hazardous medical waste disposal laws. Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations require employers to provide workers who are occupationally subject to blood or other potentially infectious materials with prescribed protections. These regulatory requirements apply to all healthcare facilities, including primary care centers, and require employers to make a determination as to which employees may be exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials and to have in effect a written exposure control plan. In addition, employers are required to provide or employ hepatitis B vaccinations, personal protective equipment and other safety devices, infection control training, post-exposure evaluation and follow-up, waste disposal techniques and procedures and work practice controls. Employers are also required to comply with various record-keeping requirements.
 
Federal and state law also governs the dispensing of controlled substances by physicians. For example, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act governs the distribution of drug samples. Physicians are required to report relationships they have with the manufacturers of drugs, medical devices and biologics through the Open Payments Program database. Any allegations or findings that CareMax or its providers have violated any of these laws or regulations could have a material adverse impact on CareMax’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
In addition, while none of the jurisdictions in which CareMax currently operates have required it, certain jurisdictions in which CareMax may desire to do business in the future have certificate of need programs regulating the establishment or expansion of healthcare facilities, including primary care centers. These regulations can be complex and time-consuming. Any failure to comply with such regulatory requirements could adversely impact CareMax’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Intellectual Property
 
CareMax’s continued growth and success depend, in part, on its ability to protect its intellectual property and internally developed technology, including CareOptimize. CareMax primarily protects its intellectual property through a combination of copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights (including confidentiality, non-disclosure and assignment-of-invention agreements with CareMax’s employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which CareMax conducts business). CareMax does not currently hold a patent or other registered or applied for intellectual protection for the CareOptimize platform, and instead relies upon non-registered rights, including trade secrets, contractual provisions and restrictions on access, to protect its intellectual property rights in CareOptimize.

However, these intellectual property rights and procedures may not prevent others from competing with CareMax. CareMax may be unable to obtain, maintain and enforce CareMax’s intellectual property rights, and assertions by third parties that CareMax violates their intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on CareMax’s business, financial condition and results of operations. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — If we are unable to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property protection for our technology or if the scope of our intellectual property protection is not sufficiently broad, particularly with respect to the CareOptimize platform, others may be able to develop and commercialize technology substantially similar to ours, and

our ability to successfully commercialize our technology may be adversely affected” and “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — Third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
 
Insurance
 
CareMax maintains insurance and excess coverage for property and general liability, professional liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, workers’ compensation, cybersecurity and other coverage in amounts and on terms believed adequate by management, based on CareMax’s actual claims experience and expectations for future claims. CareMax also utilizes stop-loss insurance for its patients, protecting CareMax for medical claims per episode in excess of certain levels which vary depending on the applicable payor. Future claims could, however, exceed CareMax’s applicable insurance coverage. CareMax provides malpractice insurance for the physician practicing at CareMax centers.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 31, 2021, CareMax had approximately 1,270 employee team members, including approximately 100 primary care providers. CareMax’s physicians and other care providers are paid salaries or contracted flat rates in order to incentive them to provide high quality care rather than volume of care.
 
This base compensation for providers is then overlaid with bonuses for quality and member satisfaction. CareMax considers its relationship with its employees to be good. None of CareMax’s employees are represented by a labor union or party to a collective bargaining agreement.
 
Seasonality
 
Our ability to grow our patient population with capitation arrangements is dependent in part on our ability to successfully enroll MA patients during the annual enrollment period. During the annual enrollment period, we must convince new MA patients to select us as their primary care provider and existing patients to not select another provider. CareMax typically sees large increases in ACA patients during the first quarter as a result of the annual enrollment period. CareMax’s operational and financial results will experience some variability depending upon the time of year in which they are measured. This variability is most notable in the following areas:
 
Per-Patient Revenue
 
CareMax’s revenue derived from at-risk patients is a function of the percent of premium CareMax has negotiated with its payors as well as its ability to accurately and appropriately document the acuity of a patient. CareMax experiences some seasonality with respect to its per-patient revenue as it will generally decline over the course of the year. In January of each year, CMS revises the risk adjustment factor for each patient based upon health conditions documented in the prior year, leading to an overall increase in per-patient revenue. As the year progresses, CareMax’s per-patient revenue declines as new patients join CareMax typically with less complete or accurate documentation (and therefore lower risk-adjustment scores) and patient mortality disproportionately impacts CareMax’s higher-risk (and therefore greater revenue) patients.
 
Medical costs
 
Medical costs vary seasonally depending on a number of factors, but most significantly the weather. Certain illnesses, such as the influenza virus, are far more prevalent during colder months of the year, which result in an increase in medical expenses during these time periods. CareMax therefore expects to see higher levels of per-patient medical costs in the first and fourth quarters. Medical costs also depend upon the number of business days in a period. Shorter periods will have lesser medical costs due to fewer business days. Business days can also create year-over-year comparability issues if one year has a different number of business days compared to another. CareMax also expects to experience an impact should there be a pandemic such as COVID-19, which may result in increased or decreased total medical costs depending upon the severity of the infection, the duration of the infection and the impact to the supply and availability of healthcare services for CareMax’s patients.
 
Our Competition
 
The U.S. healthcare industry is highly competitive. We compete with local and national providers of primary care services, including Leon Medical Centers locally in Florida and ChenMed, CanoHealth and Oak Street Health on a national level, for, among other things, recruitment of physicians and other medical and non-medical personnel, individual patients and IPAs. Because of the low barriers of entry into the primary care business and the ability of physicians to own primary care centers and/or also be medical directors for their

own centers, competition for growth in existing and expanding markets is not limited to large competitors with substantial financial resources. There have also been increasing indications of interest from non-traditional providers and others to enter the primary care space and/or develop innovative technologies or business activities that could be disruptive to the industry. For example, payors have and may continue to acquire primary care and other provider assets. Our growth strategy and our business could be adversely affected if we are not able to continue to acquire or open new medical centers, expand our healthcare providers serviced by CareOptimize, recruit qualified physicians, or attract new members and retain our existing members. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — We face significant competition from primary care facilities and other healthcare services providers. Our failure to adequately compete could adversely affect our business.”
