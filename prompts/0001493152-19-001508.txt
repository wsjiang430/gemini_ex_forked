ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
As used in this Annual Report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company” refer to Verb Technology Company, Inc., a Nevada corporation.
 
Corporate Overview – Formation, Corporate Changes and Material Mergers and Acquisitions
 
Organization
 
Cutaia Media Group, LLC (“CMG”) was organized as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 12, 2012. On May 19, 2014, CMG merged into bBooth, Inc. and bBooth, Inc., thereafter, changed its name to bBooth (USA), Inc., effective as of October 16, 2014. The operations of CMG and bBooth (USA), Inc., became known as, and are referred to in this Annual Report as, “bBoothUSA.”
 
On October 16, 2014, bBoothUSA was acquired by Global System Designs, Inc. (“GSD”), pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement entered into with GSD (the “Share Exchange Agreement”). GSD was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 27, 2012. The acquisition was accounted for as a reverse merger transaction. In connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement, GSD’s management was replaced by bBoothUSA’s management, and GSD changed its name to bBooth, Inc.
 
Effective April 21, 2017, we changed our corporate name from bBooth, Inc. to nFüsz, Inc. The name change was effected through a parent/subsidiary short-form merger of nFüsz, Inc., our wholly-owned Nevada subsidiary, formed solely for the purpose of the name change, with and into us. We were the surviving entity. To effectuate the name-change merger, we filed Articles of Merger and a Certificate of Correction (relative to the effective date of the name-change merger) with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada on April 4, 2017, and April 17, 2017, respectively. The name-change merger became effective on April 21, 2017. Our board of directors approved the name-change merger, which resulted in the name change on that date. In accordance with Section 92A.180 of the Nevada Revised Statutes (the “NRS”), stockholder approval of the merger was not required.
 
On November 8, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Sound Concepts, Inc., a Utah corporation (“Sound Concepts”), NF Merger Sub, Inc., a Utah corporation (“Merger Sub 1”), NF Acquisition Company, LLC, a Utah limited liability company (“Merger Sub 2”), the shareholders of Sound Concepts (the “Sound Concepts Shareholders”), the shareholders’ representative (the “Shareholder Representative”), and us, pursuant to which we will acquire Sound Concepts (the “Sound Concepts Acquisition”) through a two-step merger, consisting of merging Merger 1 Sub with and into Sound Concepts, with Sound Concepts surviving the “first step” of the merger as our wholly-owned subsidiary (and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub 1 will cease) and, immediately thereafter, merging Sound Concepts with and into Merger Sub 2, with Merger Sub 2 surviving the “second step” of the merger, such that, upon the conclusion of the “second step” of the merger, the separate corporate existence of Sound Concepts will cease and Merger Sub 2 will continue its limited liability company existence under Utah law as the surviving entity and as our wholly-owned subsidiary (collectively, the “Merger”). On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of Sound Concepts’ capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Sound Concepts Capital Stock”) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a proportionate share of $25,000,000 of value (the “Closing Merger Consideration”), to be payable through a combination of a cash payment by us of $15,000,000 (the “Acquisition Cash Payment”) and the issuance of shares of our Common Stock with a fair market value of $10,000,000 (the “Acquisition Stock”). The Closing Merger Consideration is not subject to any closing working capital adjustment or post-closing working capital adjustment. We expect the Sound Concepts Acquisition to close in the first quarter of 2019. However, we cannot provide any assurance as to the actual timing of completion of the Sound Concepts Acquisition, or whether the Sound Concepts Acquisition will be completed at all.

Effective February 1, 2019, we changed our corporate name from nFüsz, Inc. to Verb Technology Company, Inc. The name change was effected through a parent/subsidiary short-form merger of Verb Technology Company, Inc., our wholly-owned Nevada subsidiary, formed solely for the purpose of the name change, with and into us. We were the surviving entity. To effectuate the name-change merger, we filed Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada on January 31, 2019. The name-change merger became effective on February 1,, 2019. Our board of directors approved the name-change merger, which resulted in the name change on that date. In accordance with Section 92A.180 of the NRS, stockholder approval of the name-merger was not required.
 
On February 1, 2019, we implemented a 1-for-15 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of our common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”). The Reverse Stock Split became effective upon commencement of trading of our Common Stock on February 4, 2019. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every fifteen (15) shares of our pre-Reverse Stock Split Common Stock were combined and reclassified into one share of our Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding options, warrants, and convertible securities were also reduced by a factor of fifteen] as of February 1, 2019. All historical share and per-share amounts reflected throughout our consolidated financial statements and other financial information in this Annual Report have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. The par value per share of our Common Stock was not affected by the Reverse Stock Split.
 
Our Business
 
We are an applications services provider, marketing cloud-based business software products under the brand name “Tagg” on a subscription basis. Our flagship product, TaggCRM, is a Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”) application that is distinguishable from other CRM programs because it utilizes interactive video as the primary means of communication between sales and marketing professionals and their clients or prospects. TaggCRM allows our users to create, distribute, and post interactive videos that contain on-screen clickable “Taggs” which are interactive icons, buttons, and other on-screen elements, that, when clicked, allow their prospects and customers to respond to our users’ call to action in real-time, in the video, while the video is playing, without leaving or stopping the video. For example, our technology allows a prospective customer or a prospect the ability to click on a product they see featured in a video and buy it, or to click on a calendar icon in the video to make an appointment with a salesperson, among many other features and functionality. Tagg videos can be distributed via email or text messaging and can be posted on social media. Our users report increased sales conversion rates compared to traditional, non-interactive video.
 
We developed the proprietary patent-pending interactive video technology that serves as the basis for all of our cloud, Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) Tagg applications. Our Tagg applications are accessible on all mobile and desktop devices and no software download is required to view the Tagg interactive videos. The Tagg applications also provide detailed analytics in the application dashboard that reflect when the videos were viewed, by whom, how many times, for how long, and what interactive Taggs were clicked-on in the video, among other things, all of which assist our users in focusing their sales and marketing efforts by identifying which clients or prospects have interest in the subject matter of the video. TaggCRM users receive a text message immediately notifying them that a customer prospect received their video and additional text messages notifying them when that customer or prospect watched the video and shared the video so they can follow-up in real-time.
 
Our Tagg application platform can accommodate any size sales or marketing campaign, and it is enterprise-class scalable to meet the needs of today’s global organizations.
 
Our TaggMED application is designed for physicians and other healthcare providers to create more efficient and effective interactive communications with patients. Patients are able to avoid unnecessary and inconvenient visits to their physicians’ or other healthcare providers’ offices by viewing and responding to interactive videos through in-video, on-screen clicks that are designed to assess the patient’s need for an office visit. If the patient’s responses to the interactive video indicate that an office visit is either necessary or desirable, the patient can schedule the office visit right in through video in real time. Patients can also download and print prescriptions, care instructions, and other physician distributed documents right from and through the video. TaggMED is offered on a subscription basis.

Our TaggEDU application is designed for teachers and school administrators for more effective communications with students, parents, and faculty. TaggEDU allows teachers to deliver interactive video lessons to students that are both more engaging and more effective. TaggEDU allows teachers to communicate with students through their mobile devices and computers to deliver lessons and tests/quizzes on the screen and in the Tagg video. The analytics capabilities of TaggEDU available on the application dashboard of the teacher or school administrator allow them to track which students watched the lesson, when, for how long, how many times, and track and report on test/quiz results. TaggEDU is offered on a subscription basis.
 
Our TaggLIVE application is also part of our proprietary interactive Tagg video applications portfolio. TaggLIVE is a Facebook application that works in conjunction with Facebook Live, allowing users of Facebook Live to place clickable Taggs on the screens of everyone watching their Facebook Live broadcasts in real time. Viewers can click the on-screen Taggs to purchase products and services placed there and offered by the person utilizing our TaggLIVE Facebook application. TaggLIVE is scheduled for release in the first quarter of 2019.

Marketing
 
We utilize our own proprietary interactive video platform as the foundation of our ongoing marketing initiatives. Our initiatives include daily, broad-based social media engagement by a dedicated team of full-time employees and outside consultants; management of our interactive video-based website; interactive video-based email campaigns, television commercials, among many other ongoing initiatives designed to increase awareness of our products and services and drive conversion and adoption rates.
 
As part of our partnership agreement with Microsoft, we will have access to their “Go-To-Market Services” and technical resources to help us market and sell our integrated products to Microsoft customers, as well as other Microsoft partners and systems integrators in Microsoft’s network all over the world.
 
On December 21, 2018, we entered into an agreement with Major Tom Agency, Inc., a premier digital marketing agency with offices in New York, Toronto and Vancouver, to design, launch and manage a comprehensive national marketing campaign for us. The campaign is expected to launch in late February 2019.


Competition
 
CRM software generated more than $40.7 billion in sales revenue throughout the world in 2017, has grown to become the largest software segment, overtaking data management software, and is expected to reach more than $80 billion in sales revenue by 2025. We are active in the CRM applications industry. We believe that CRM applications that incorporate our proprietary Tagg interactive video technology provide significant competitive advantages over the CRM applications offered by the long-term leaders in the field: Salesforce.com, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP SE, and Adobe Inc. (“Adobe”), which collectively account for approximately 40% of industry sales. These companies, as well as many others, have numerous differences in feature sets and functionality, but all share certain basic attributes. Most of them were designed before the advent and proliferation of mobile phones, social media, and the technology behind the current ubiquity of video over the internet and more recently on mobile devices. While many of them have attempted to incorporate video capabilities into their respective CRM platforms, sometimes in ‘‘bolt-on’’ fashion, it is our opinion that none of them has done so in an effective manner, and certainly none of them utilizes interactive video technology similar to ours, which places clickable calls to action right in the video, including into users’ pre-existing sales and product videos. In addition, Tagg interactive videos are viewable on both mobile and desktop devices regardless of operating system and without the need to download a proprietary player or program.
 
These differences serve to highlight the reasons we have chosen not only to develop our own stand-alone SaaS cloud CRM platform, but also to incorporate and integrate our interactive video technology into the platforms of many of these large, long-term leaders in the CRM industry. This allows them to offer Tagg interactive video capabilities to their large enterprise clients and customers as an upgrade feature to their CRM platform subscriptions. The viability of this strategy is evidenced by the partnerships we currently enjoy with Oracle NetSuite and Adobe Marketo, as well as new partnerships with Salesforce.com. and Microsoft, among others. Nevertheless, the market share, marketing strength, and competitive advantages of our competitors may preclude our obtaining any material share of this market.

Intellectual Property
 
Our policy is to protect our technology by, among other things, trade secret protection and copyrights. We primarily rely upon trade secrets and copyrighted proprietary software, code, and know-how to protect our Tagg interactive video technology platform and associated applications. We have taken security measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, to the extent possible. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not prove to be adequate and our competitors may independently develop technology or products that are similar to ours or that compete with ours. Trade secret and copyright laws afford only limited protection for our technology and products. The laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Third parties may also design around our proprietary rights, which may render our protected technology and products less valuable, if the design around is favorably received in the marketplace.
 
We recently filed a patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or “PTO,” with respect to our interactive video technology. Our patent application may not result in an issued patent in a timely manner, or at all. Any patents that may be issued in the future may not protect commercially important aspects of our technology. Furthermore, the validity and enforceability of such patents issued in the future may be challenged by third parties and could be invalidated or modified by the PTO. Third parties may independently develop technology that is not covered by our patents, that is similar to, or competes with, our technology. In addition, our intellectual property may be infringed or misappropriated by third parties, particularly in foreign countries where the laws and governmental authorities may not protect our proprietary rights as effectively as those in the United States.
 
In addition, if any of our products or technology is covered by third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, we could be subject to various legal actions. We cannot assure you that our technology platform and products do not infringe patents held by others or that they will not in the future. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement, invalidity, misappropriation, or other claims.
 
Research and Development
 
We incurred $980,000 and $375,000 of research and development expenses during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These funds were primarily used for development of our Tagg interactive video CRM software.
Suppliers
 
We currently rely on a full-time, dedicated, external team of experienced professionals for the coding and maintenance of our software. We believe we have mitigated the associated risks of managing an external team of software development professionals by incorporating internal management and oversight, as well as appropriate systems, protocols, controls, and procedures and ensuring that we have access to additional qualified professionals to provide like or complementary services.
Dependence on Key Customers
 
Based on our current business and anticipated future activities as described in this Annual Report, we do not have, and do not expect to have, any significant customer concentration. Accordingly, we do not expect to be dependent on any key customers.
Government Regulation
 
Government regulation is not of significant concern for our business nor is government regulation expected to become an impediment to the business in the near- or mid-term as management is currently unaware of any planned or anticipated government regulation that would have a material impact on our business. Our management believes it currently possesses all requisite authority to conduct our business as described in this Annual Report.
Employees
 
As of February 1, 2019, we had 10 full-time statutory employees, and 14 full-time consultants and contractors. We also employ consultants and contractors on an as-needed-basis to provide specific expertise in areas of software design, development and coding, content creation, audio and video editing, video production services, and other business functions, including marketing and accounting. None of our employees or consultants, are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have had no labor-related work stoppages and believe our relationship with our employees, consultants, and consultants, both full-time and part-time, is good.
