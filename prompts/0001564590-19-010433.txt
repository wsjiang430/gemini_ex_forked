General
 We offer lifestyle-oriented general merchandise and consumer products and services through a portfolio of global consumer brands comprised of the Anthropologie, Bhldn, Free People, Terrain and Urban Outfitters brands and our Food and Beverage division. We have achieved compounded annual sales growth of approximately 5% over the past five years, with sales of approximately $4.0 billion during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019.
 We operate under two reportable segments – Retail and Wholesale. Our Retail segment contains the Anthropologie, Bhldn, Free People, Terrain and Urban Outfitters brands and our Food and Beverage division. We have over 48 years of experience creating and managing retail stores that offer highly differentiated collections of fashion apparel, accessories and home goods, among other things, in inviting and dynamic store settings. Our core strategy is to provide unified environments that establish emotional bonds with the customer, primarily through Company-owned stores but also through franchised or third-party operated stores. In addition to retail stores, we offer our products and services directly to our customers through our websites, mobile applications, catalogs, customer contact centers and digital businesses.
 The Food and Beverage division includes various casual dining concepts.
 We operate a Wholesale segment under the Free People, Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters brands. The Wholesale segment sells through department and specialty stores worldwide, digital businesses and our Retail segment. The Wholesale segment primarily designs, develops and markets apparel, intimates, activewear and home goods.

 Our omni-channel strategy enhances our customers’ brand experience by providing a seamless approach to the customer shopping experience. All available Company-owned shopping channels are fully integrated, including stores, websites, mobile applications, catalogs and customer contact centers. Our investments in areas such as marketing campaigns and technology advancements are designed to generate demand for the omni-channel and not the separate store or digital channels. Store sales are primarily fulfilled from that store’s inventory, but may also be shipped from any of our fulfillment centers or from a different store location if an item is not available at the original store. Digital orders are primarily shipped to our customers through our fulfillment centers, but may also be shipped from any store, or a combination of fulfillment centers and stores depending on the availability of particular items. Digital orders may also be picked up at a store location, and customers may also return certain merchandise purchased through digital channels at store locations. As our customers continue to shop across multiple channels, we have adapted our approach towards meeting this demand. Due to the availability of like product in a variety of shopping channels, we source these products utilizing single stock keeping units (“SKUs”) based on the omni-channel demand rather than the demand of the separate channels. These and other technological capabilities allow us to better serve our customers and help us complete sales that otherwise may not have occurred due to out-of-stock positions. We manage and analyze our performance based on a single omni-channel rather than separate channels and believe that the omni-channel results present the most meaningful and appropriate measure of our performance.
 Our fiscal year ends on January 31. All references to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on January 31 in those years. For example, our fiscal 2019 ended on January 31, 2019.

In addition to individual brand stores, we operate expanded format stores that include multiple Anthropologie Group brands, allowing us to present an expanded assortment of products in certain categories. Our stores are located in specialty centers, upscale street locations and enclosed malls. We plan to open approximately three Anthropologie Group stores and close approximately seven Anthropologie Group stores due to lease expiration, globally, in fiscal 2020. The Anthropologie Group is at or close to our desired maximum store count in the United States and Canada. We plan for future store growth to come from expansion internationally, which may include opening stores in new and existing markets or entering into franchise or joint venture agreements. We plan for future digital channel growth to come from expansion domestically and internationally, including enhancing our presence in third-party digital marketplaces, such as Tmall in China and through our franchise partners. The Anthropologie Group operates websites and mobile applications in North America and Europe that capture the spirit of its brands by offering a similar yet broader selection of merchandise as found in its stores, offers catalogs in North America and Europe that market select merchandise, most of which is also available in Anthropologie brand stores, and partners with a third-party digital marketplace to offer a limited selection of merchandise, which is available in Asia. The Anthropologie Group’s North American and European Retail segment net sales accounted for approximately 38.6% and 1.7% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2019.

 As of January 31, 2019, we operated 135 Free People stores, of which 127 were located in the United States, six were located in Canada and two were located in Europe. We plan to open approximately ten new Free People stores and close approximately three Free People stores due to lease expiration, globally, in fiscal 2020. Free People is approaching our desired maximum store count in the United States and Canada. We plan for future store growth to come from expansion internationally, which may include opening stores in new and existing markets or entering into additional franchise or joint venture agreements. We plan for future digital channel growth to come from expansion domestically and internationally, including enhancing our presence in third-party digital marketplaces, such as Tmall in China and through our franchise partners.

Free People also offers a catalog that markets select merchandise, most of which is also available in our Free People stores, and partners with third-party digital marketplaces to offer a limited selection of merchandise, which is available in Asia. Free People’s North American and European Retail segment net sales accounted for approximately 11.6% and less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales, respectively, for fiscal 2019.
 Food and Beverage. In February 2016, we acquired six restaurants as part of our acquisition of the Vetri Family group of restaurants, which were combined with our existing restaurants to form our Food and Beverage division. The Food and Beverage division focuses on a dining experience that provides excellence in food, beverage and service. As of January 31, 2019, we operated 13 restaurants, all of which were located in the United States. We plan to open approximately two new restaurants in fiscal 2020. The Food and Beverage division net sales accounted for less than 1.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019.
 Wholesale Segment
 The Wholesale segment consists of the Free People, Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters brands. The Wholesale segment was established in 1984 with the Free People brand to develop, in conjunction with Urban Outfitters, private label apparel lines of young women’s casual wear that could be effectively sold at attractive prices in Urban Outfitters stores and later began selling to department and specialty stores worldwide. The Anthropologie wholesale division, established in fiscal 2018, designs and sells home goods to select department stores. The Urban Outfitters wholesale division, established in fiscal 2019, designs and sells the BDG apparel collection to select department stores. We display our wholesale products in certain department stores using a shop-within-shop sales model. We believe that the shop-within-shop model allows for a more complete merchandising of our products, which allows us to differentiate ourselves from our competition and further strengthens each brand’s image. During fiscal 2019, the Wholesale segment’s range of young women’s contemporary casual apparel, intimates, FP Movement activewear and shoes under the Free People brand, home goods, including gifts, tabletop and textiles, under the Anthropologie brand and the BDG apparel collection under the Urban Outfitters brand were sold through approximately 2,200 department and specialty stores worldwide, including Macy’s, Nordstrom, Dillard’s, Selfridge’s, John Lewis, digital businesses and our Retail segment. We monitor the styles and products that are popular with our wholesale customers to give us insight into current fashion trends, helping us to better serve our retail customers. Wholesale sales and showroom facilities are 
 3

located in London, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York City. Our Wholesale segment net sales accounted for approximately 8.8% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019.
 Store Environment
 We create a unified environment in our stores that establishes an emotional bond with the customer. Every element of the environment is tailored to the aesthetic preferences of our target customers. Through creative design, much of the existing retail space is modified to incorporate a mosaic of fixtures, finishes and revealed architectural details. In our stores, merchandise is integrated into a variety of creative vignettes and displays designed to offer our customers an entire look at a distinct lifestyle. This dynamic visual merchandising and display technique provides the connection among the store design, the merchandise and the customer. Essential components of the ambiance of each store may include playing music that appeals to our target customers, using unique signage and employing a staff that understands and identifies with the target customer.
 Our Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie Group and Free People stores are primarily located in upscale street locations, free-standing locations, enclosed malls and specialty centers. We plan for our store environment and location strategy to remain consistent over the next several years.Buying and Design Operations
 Maintaining a constant flow of fresh and fashionable merchandise for our Retail segment is critically important to our ongoing performance. We maintain our own buying groups that select and develop products to satisfy our target customers and provide us with the appropriate amount and timing of products offered. Our buyers stay in touch with the evolving tastes of their target customers by shopping at major trade markets, attending national and regional trade shows and staying current with mass media influences, including social media, music, video, film, magazines and pop culture.
 Our buyers and designers play an important role in our ability to identify and deliver the latest fashion trends to our customers. The success of our brands relies upon our ability to attract, train and retain talented, highly motivated buying and design employees. In addition to management training programs for both newly hired and existing employees, we have a number of retention programs that offer qualitative and quantitative performance-based incentives.
 Merchandise
 Our Urban Outfitters brand offers a wide array of eclectic merchandise, including women’s and men’s fashion apparel, activewear, intimates, footwear, accessories, home goods, electronics and beauty. Our Anthropologie brand product offerings include women’s casual apparel, accessories, intimates, shoes, home furnishings, a diverse array of gifts and decorative items and beauty and wellness. Our Bhldn brand offers a curated collection of heirloom quality wedding gowns, bridesmaid frocks, party dresses, assorted jewelry, headpieces, footwear, lingerie and decorations. Our Terrain brand product offerings include lifestyle home, garden and outdoor living products, antiques, live plants, flowers, wellness products and accessories. Our Free People brand offers a showcase for casual women’s apparel, intimates, FP Movement activewear, shoes, accessories, home products, gifts and beauty and wellness. Our merchandise is continuously updated to appeal to our target customers’ changing tastes and is supplied by a large number of domestic and foreign vendors, with new shipments of merchandise arriving at our stores and fulfillment centers almost daily.
 The wide breadth of merchandise offered by our brands includes a combination of national third-party brands, private label product designed in collaboration with third-party brands and exclusive merchandise developed and designed internally by our brands. This combination allows us to offer fashionable merchandise and to differentiate our product mix from that of traditional department stores, as well as that of other specialty and digital retailers. Private label and exclusive merchandise generally yields higher gross profit margins than third-party branded merchandise, and helps to keep our product offerings current and unique.
 The ever-changing mix of products available to our customers allows us to adapt our merchandise to prevailing fashion trends, and together with the inviting atmosphere and experience of our stores and websites, encourages our core customers to visit our shopping channels frequently.
 We select price points for our merchandise that are consistent with the spending patterns of our target customers. As such, our stores carry merchandise at a wide range of price points that may vary considerably within product categories.
 Store Operations
 We have organized our retail store operations by brand into geographic areas or districts that each have a district leader. District leaders are responsible for several stores and monitor and supervise individual store leaders. Each store leader is responsible for overseeing the daily operations of one of our stores. In addition to a store leader, the staff of a typical store includes a combination of some or all of the following positions: a visual merchandising manager, several department managers and full and part-time sales and visual staff. The staff of a typical Anthropologie brand store may also include a customer care manager who helps tailor the shopping experience to the needs of Anthropologie’s target customers. An expanded format Anthropologie Group store may also include a bridal and event manager, appointment stylist, a bridal category specialist and merchandise care and maintenance staff to support the Bhldn and Terrain brands.

An essential requirement for the success of our stores is our ability to attract, train and retain talented, highly motivated store leaders, visual merchandising managers and other key employees. In addition to management training programs for both newly hired and existing employees, we have a number of retention programs that offer qualitative and quantitative performance-based incentives to district-level leaders, store leaders and full-time sales associates.
 Marketing and Promotion
 We believe we have highly effective marketing tools in our websites, mobile applications, catalogs, email campaigns and social media. We refresh this media as frequently as daily to reflect the most cutting edge changes in fashion and culture. We also believe that highly visible store locations, broad merchandise selection and creative and visual presentation within our stores, on our websites and on our mobile applications entice our customers to explore these channels and purchase merchandise. Consequently, we rely on these elements, as well as the brand recognition created by our direct marketing activities, to draw customers to our omni-channel operations, rather than traditional forms of advertising such as print, radio and television media. Marketing activities for each of our brand’s retail stores may include special event promotions and a variety of public relations activities designed to create community awareness of our stores and products. We plan for our catalog circulation to decrease in fiscal 2020 as we increase our emphasis on digital marketing. Loyalty programs offer customers access to member-only benefits and rewards, which promotes brand loyalty. We also are active in social media and blogs. We believe that the traditional method of a one-way communication to customers is no longer enough. We believe that by starting a conversation and interacting directly with our customers, most notably via Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube, Tumblr and our own mobile applications, we are more effective at understanding and serving their fashion needs. We also believe that our blogs continue this conversation. Not only do our blogs allow us to communicate what inspires us, they also allow our customers to tell us what inspires them. This fosters our relationships with our customers and encourages them to continue shopping with us.
Customer Loyalty Programs
 The Urban Outfitters brand offers UO Rewards, a customer loyalty program designed to create authentic, lasting relationships with customers by rewarding devoted members with reward coupons, exclusive offers and unique experiences. Members can earn and accumulate points based on purchase activity and engaging with the brand through social media. Upon reaching the specified point threshold, members are issued a reward coupon which can be redeemed for both in-store and online purchases.
The Anthropologie brand offers AnthroPerks. AnthroPerks is a customer loyalty program that is all about our customer. The program is designed to deliver benefits and experiences to help make her shopping journey in-store and online easier and more inspirational. Members are given free shipping benefits, birthday discounts, receipt look up, exclusive offers, early access to special collections and invitations to “only at Anthro” experiences. 
 Suppliers
 To serve our target customers and to recognize changes in fashion trends and seasonality, we purchase merchandise from numerous foreign and domestic vendors, the majority of which is settled in U.S. dollars. We also have arrangements with agents and third-party manufacturers to produce our private label merchandise. To keep our future inventory levels lean and maintain a lower merchandise weeks of supply on hand, we plan to continue to quicken our supply chain capabilities and place more frequent merchandise orders at lower quantities. To the extent that our vendors are located overseas or, in the case of third-party vendors, rely on overseas sources for a large portion of their merchandise, any event causing a disruption of imports, such as the imposition of increased security or regulatory requirements applicable to imported goods, war, public health concerns, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, port security considerations or labor disputes, financial or political instability in any of the countries in which merchandise we purchase is manufactured, the effects of Brexit, changes to U.S. or foreign trade policies, including the enactment of tariffs, border adjustment taxes, or increases in duties or quotas, disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials, increases in the cost of fuel or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could adversely affect our business. During fiscal 2019, we purchased merchandise from approximately 5,500 vendors located throughout the world. No single vendor or manufacturer accounted for more than 10% of merchandise purchased during that time. While certain of our vendors have limited financial resources and production capabilities, we do not believe that the loss of any one vendor would have a material adverse effect on our business.
Company Operations
 Distribution. We own a 291,000 square foot distribution center in Gap, Pennsylvania that receives and distributes approximately half of our retail store merchandise in North America. We also lease a 214,500 square foot distribution center located in Reno, Nevada that receives and distributes the remaining half of our retail store merchandise.
 We own and operate a 1,000,000 square foot fulfillment center in Gap, Pennsylvania. Primary operations at the center include Retail and Wholesale segment fulfillment services, including inventory warehousing, receiving and customer shipping.
 We also own and operate a 463,000 square foot fulfillment center located in Reno, Nevada. This center is used primarily to house and distribute merchandise to our western United States digital customers.
 5

In fiscal 2019, we began construction on an approximately 956,000 square foot fulfillment center in Indiana, Pennsylvania, which we will own and operate. The center will primarily store and distribute certain home furnishings merchandise.
 In fiscal 2019, we signed a lease for a 309,000 square foot fulfillment center located in Bristol, Pennsylvania. Construction is expected to be completed, and operations to commence, by mid-fiscal 2020. The center will primarily support our digital sales channel.
 We lease separate distribution and fulfillment centers each located in Rushden, England. Our 98,000 square foot distribution center supports our entire European store base and our 142,000 square foot fulfillment center primarily provides fulfillment services for our European Retail segment and global Wholesale segment customers. We are nearing maximum capacity at these centers and are exploring expansion opportunities.
 We utilize certain third-party logistics providers to store and distribute certain home furnishings merchandise. In fiscal 2020, we signed an agreement with a third-party logistics provider in China to store and distribute merchandise sold through our partnership with a third-party digital marketplace.
 Information Systems. We recognize the need for high-quality information to manage merchandise planning, buying, inventory management and control functions and have therefore invested in a retail software package that meets our processing and reporting requirements. We utilize point-of-sale register systems connected by a secure data network to our home offices. Additionally, our stores have mobile point-of-sale devices that have virtually the same functionality as our cash registers. These systems provide for register efficiencies, timely customer checkout and instant back office access to register information, as well as daily updates of sales, inventory data and price changes. In fiscal 2019, we launched self-checkout registers in certain retail locations and plan to expand this initiative to additional retail locations in fiscal 2020. Our digital channel, which includes our websites, mobile applications and catalogs, maintains separate software systems that manage the merchandise and customer information for our in-house customer contact center and fulfillment functions. Our Wholesale segment uses a separate software system for customer service, order entry, production planning and inventory management. We have a second fully redundant data center located in our Reno fulfillment center that functions as a disaster recovery site for our digital, data communication and other business critical systems.
Competition
 Our Retail and Wholesale segments compete with individual and chain fashion specialty stores as well as department stores, both in stores and online, in highly competitive domestic and international markets. Our Retail segment competes on the basis of, among other things, the location of our stores, website, mobile application and catalog presentation, website and mobile application design, the breadth, quality, style, price and availability of our merchandise and the level of customer service offered. Although we believe that the eclectic mix of products and the unique store and digital experiences offered by our Retail segment help differentiate us, it also means that our stores compete against a wide variety of smaller, independent specialty retailers, as well as department stores and national specialty chains. Some of our competitors have substantially greater name recognition as well as financial, marketing and other resources. Our Anthropologie Group and Free People stores also face competition from small boutiques that offer an individualized shopping experience similar to the one we strive to provide to our target customers. In addition, some of our third-party vendors offer products directly to consumers and certain of our competitors.
 Along with certain Retail segment competitive factors noted above, other key factors for our digital channel include website and mobile application availability, the effectiveness of our customer lists and the speed and accuracy of our merchandise delivery. Additionally, our digital channel competes against numerous websites, mobile applications and catalogs, which may have a greater volume of circulation and web traffic or more effective marketing through online media and social networking sites.
 Our Wholesale segment competes with numerous wholesale companies on the basis of quality, price, performance and fashion of our merchandise offerings. Many of our Wholesale segment competitors have a wider product distribution network. In addition, certain of our wholesale competitors have greater name recognition and greater financial, marketing and other resources than us.
 Trademarks and Service Marks
 We are the registered owner in the United States of certain service marks and trademarks, including, but not limited to “Urban Outfitters,” “Anthropologie,” “Free People,” “Bhldn,” “Terrain,” “Vetri” and “BDG.” Each mark is renewable indefinitely, contingent upon continued use at the time of renewal. In addition, we currently have pending registration applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office covering certain other marks. We also own marks that have been registered in foreign countries, and have applications for marks pending in additional foreign countries. We regard our marks as important to our business due to their name recognition with our customers. We are not aware of any valid claims of infringement or challenges to our right to use any of our marks in the United States.
Employees
 As of January 31, 2019, we employed approximately 24,000 people, approximately 40% of whom were full-time employees. The number of part-time employees fluctuates depending on seasonal needs. Of our total employees, approximately 1% work in the 
 6

Wholesale segment and the remaining 99% work in our Retail segment. Except in certain international locations, our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are excellent.
 Financial Information about Operations
 We aggregate our operations into two reportable segments, the Retail segment and the Wholesale segment. See Note 16, “Segment Reporting,” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Financial Information about Geographical Areas
 See Note 16, “Segment Reporting,” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding net sales and long-lived assets from domestic and foreign operations.
Seasonality
 Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations in net sales and net income, with a more significant portion typically realized in the second half of each year predominantly due to the year-end holiday period. Historically, and consistent with the retail industry, this seasonality also impacts our working capital requirements, particularly with regard to inventory. See Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Seasonality and Quarterly Results for additional information.
