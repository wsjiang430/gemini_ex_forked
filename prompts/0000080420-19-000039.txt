Item 1. Business
Overview
Powell Industries, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 2004 as a successor to a Nevada company incorporated in 1968. The Nevada company was the successor to a company founded by William E. Powell in 1947, which merged into the Company in 1977. We are headquartered in Houston, Texas, and our major subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned, include: Powell Electrical Systems, Inc.; Powell (UK) Limited; Powell Canada Inc. and Powell Industries International, B.V.
Our website is powellind.com. We make available, free of charge on or through our website, copies of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as is reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Additionally, all of our reports filed with the SEC are available via their website at http://www.sec.gov.
We develop, design, manufacture and service custom-engineered equipment and systems which (1) distribute, control and monitor the flow of electrical energy and (2) provide protection to motors, transformers and other electrically powered equipment. Our principal products include integrated power control room substations (PCRs®), custom-engineered modules, electrical houses (E-Houses), traditional and arc-resistant distribution switchgear and control gear, medium-voltage circuit breakers, monitoring and control communications systems, motor control centers and bus duct systems. These products are designed for application voltages ranging from 480 volts to 38,000 volts and are used in oil and gas refining, onshore and offshore oil and gas production, petrochemical, liquid natural gas terminals, pipeline, terminal, mining and metals, light rail traction power, electric utility, pulp and paper and other heavy industrial markets. Our product scope includes designs tested to meet both U.S. and international standards, under both the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and International Electrotechnical Commission. We assist customers by providing value-added services such as spare parts, field service inspection, installation, commissioning, modification and repair, retrofit and retrofill components for existing systems and replacement circuit breakers for switchgear that is obsolete or that is no longer produced by the original manufacturer. We seek to establish long-term relationships with the end users of our systems as well as the design and construction engineering firms contracted by those end users. We believe that our culture of safety and focus on customer satisfaction, along with our financial strength, allow us to continue to capitalize on opportunities in the industries we serve.
References to Fiscal 2019, Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 used throughout this Annual Report relate to our fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Customers and Markets
Our principal customers are typically sophisticated users of large amounts of electrical energy that typically require a complex combination of electrical components and systems. These customers' industries include oil and gas refining, onshore and offshore oil and gas production, petrochemical, pipeline, terminal, mining and metals, light rail traction power, electric utility, pulp and paper and other heavy industrial markets. Specific to the oil and gas sector, we serve both the upstream and downstream end markets. Within the downstream segment, our primary customers typically are engaged in refining activities and/or leveraging natural gas feedstocks for the production of petrochemical or Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) products. We have developed strong relationships with our customers over the years and strive to maintain our position as a preferred service provider to solve our customers' complex electrical needs.
Products and services are principally sold directly to the end user or to an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm on behalf of the end user. Each project is specifically engineered and manufactured to meet the exact specifications and requirements of the individual customer. Powell’s expertise is in the design and engineering, manufacturing, project management and integration of the various systems into a single custom-engineered deliverable. We market and sell our products and services, which are typically awarded in competitive bid situations, to a wide variety of customers, governmental agencies, markets and geographic regions. Contracts often represent large-scale and complex projects with an individual customer. By their nature, these projects are typically nonrecurring. Thus, multiple and/or continuous projects of similar magnitude with the same customer may vary. As such, the timing of large project awards may cause material fluctuations in our revenues and gross profits.
Occasionally our contracts may operate under a consortium or teaming arrangement. Typically, we enter into these arrangements with reputable companies that we have conducted business with previously. These arrangements are generally made to leverage competitive positioning or where scale and/or size dictates the use of such arrangement.

Due to the nature and timing of large projects, a significant percentage of our revenues in a given period may result from one specific contract or customer. Although we could be adversely impacted by a significant reduction in business volume from a particular industry, we do not believe the loss of any specific customer would have a material adverse effect on our business. However, from time to time, an individual manufacturing facility may have significant volume from one particular customer that would be material to that facility. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in Fiscal 2019, Fiscal 2018 or Fiscal 2017.  
Competition 
We strive to be the supplier of choice for custom-engineered system solutions and services to a variety of customers and markets. Our activities are predominantly in the oil and gas and electric utility industries, but also include other markets where customers need to manage, monitor and control large amounts of electrical energy. The majority of our business is in support of capital investment projects that are highly complex and competitively bid. Our customized systems are designed to meet the specifications of our customers. Each system is designed, engineered and manufactured to the specific requirements of the particular application. We consider our engineering, project management, systems integration and technical support capabilities vital to the success of our business.
We believe our products and services, integration capabilities, technical and project management strengths, application engineering expertise and specialty contracting experience, together with our responsiveness and flexibility to the needs of our customers and our financial strength, give us a sustainable competitive advantage in our markets. We compete with a small number of multinational competitors that sell to a broad industrial and geographic market, as well as smaller, regional competitors that typically have limited capabilities and scope of supply. Some of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater global resources such as engineering, manufacturing and marketing. Our principal competitors include ABB, Eaton, Schneider and Siemens. The competitive factors used during bid evaluation by our customers vary from project to project and may include technical support and application expertise, engineering and manufacturing capabilities, equipment rating, delivered value, scheduling and price. While projects are typically non-recurring, a significant portion of our business is from repeat customers and many times involves third-party EPC firms hired by the end user and with whom we also have long, established relationships. Ultimately, our competitive position is dependent upon our ability to provide quality custom-engineered products, services and systems on a timely basis at a competitive price.
Backlog
Backlog represents management's estimate of the remaining unsatisfied performance obligation from work to be performed on our firm orders under uncompleted contracts and customer purchase orders, including approved change orders as well as new contractual agreements on which work has not begun. Our backlog will be recognized as revenue as we complete the remaining performance obligations. Our backlog does not include service- and maintenance-type contracts for which we have the rights to invoice as services are performed. Typically, our contracts may have an early termination for convenience clause at the discretion of our customers; however, most of these contracts typically provide for the reimbursement of our costs incurred and a reasonable margin in the event of such early termination. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodology used by other companies. 
Our backlog at September 30, 2019 totaled $419.0 million compared to $260.9 million at September 30, 2018. Backlog improved primarily due to increased demand from our customers in our core oil and gas and petrochemical markets. We anticipate that approximately $344.6 million of Fiscal 2019 ending backlog will be fulfilled during our fiscal year ending September 30, 2020. Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results as orders in our backlog may be cancelled or modified by our customers and may not be indicative of continuing revenue performance over future fiscal quarters.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
The principal raw materials used in our operations include steel, copper and aluminum and various electrical components. Material costs represented 47% of revenues in Fiscal 2019, Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017. Unanticipated changes in material requirements, market conditions and disruptions in the supply chain or price increases could impact production costs and affect our consolidated results of operations.

Our supply base for certain key components and raw materials is limited. Changes in our design to accommodate similar components from other suppliers could be implemented to resolve a supply problem related to a sole-sourced component. In this circumstance, supply problems could result in delays in our ability to meet commitments to our customers. We believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally sufficient, and we do not believe a temporary shortage of materials will cause any significant adverse impact in the future. While we are not dependent on any one supplier for the majority of our raw materials, we are highly dependent on our suppliers in order to meet commitments to our customers. While we have not experienced significant or unusual issues in the purchase of key raw materials or components in the past three fiscal years, we continue to monitor the availability and price of components and raw materials on a regular basis, as well as any potential impact on our operations. 
Our business is subject to the effects of changing material prices. During the last three fiscal years, we have not experienced significant price volatility for raw materials or component parts used in the production of our products. While the cost outlook for commodities used in the production of our products is not certain, we believe we can manage this volatility through contract pricing adjustments, with material-cost predictive estimating and by actively pursuing internal cost reduction efforts. We did not enter into any derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to commodity price changes in Fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017.
Employees
At September 30, 2019, we had 2,312 full-time employees located primarily in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. Our employees are not represented by unions, and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good. Periodically, demand for qualified personnel increases in certain geographic areas due to increased construction or economic activity. We continue to monitor our demand for skilled and unskilled labor and provide training and competitive compensation packages in an effort to attract and retain skilled employees.
Intellectual Property
While we hold various patents, trademarks, servicemarks, copyrights and licenses, we do not consider any individual intellectual property to be material to our consolidated business operations.
