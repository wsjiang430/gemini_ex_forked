Item 1. BUSINESS
General
NACCO Industries, Inc. (“NACCO” or the “Company”) is the public holding company for The North American Coal Corporation.  The North American Coal Corporation and its affiliated companies (collectively, “NACoal”) operate surface mines that supply coal primarily to power generation companies under long-term contracts, and provide other value-added services to natural resource companies.  In addition, its North American Mining ("NAM") business operates and maintains draglines and other equipment under contracts with sellers of aggregates.  NACoal’s service-based business model aligns its operating goals with customers’ objectives.  
Additional information relating to financial and operating data on a segment basis (including NACCO and Other) is set forth under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Part II of this Form 10-K and in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K.
NACCO was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1986 in connection with the formation of a holding company structure for a predecessor corporation organized in 1913. As of December 31, 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 2,400 employees, including approximately 2,000 employees at the Company’s unconsolidated mining operations.
The Company makes its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports available, free of charge, through its website, www.nacco.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Significant Events
During 2018, 2017 and 2016, NACoal expanded its NAM business by adding several new customers.
On September 29, 2017, the Company spun-off Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company ("HBBHC"), a former wholly owned subsidiary. As a result of the spin-off, NACCO stockholders received one share of HBBHC Class A common stock and one share of HBBHC Class B common stock for each share of NACCO Class A or Class B common stock owned on the record date for the spin-off. The financial position, results of operations and cash flows of HBBHC are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the date of the spin-off. 
On September 28, 2017, prior to the spin-off, HBBHC paid NACCO a one-time $35.0 million cash dividend. This payment was in addition to $3.0 million in dividends HBBHC paid to NACCO from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017.
On June 28, 2017, Southern Company and its subsidiary, Mississippi Power, suspended operations involving the coal gasifier portion of the Kemper County energy facility. Liberty Fuels Company, LLC ("Liberty"), an unconsolidated mining operation, was the sole supplier of coal to fuel the gasifier under its contract with Mississippi Power. Liberty ceased all mining and delivery of lignite in 2017 and commenced mine reclamation in 2018.
On January 1, 2017, Bisti Fuels Company, LLC ("Bisti"), an unconsolidated mining operation, became the contract miner at Navajo Transitional Energy Company's ("NTEC's") Navajo Mine.
Centennial Natural Resources, LLC ("Centennial") ceased active mining operations at the end of 2015. During 2016 and 2017, the Company's NACoal subsidiary recorded non-cash impairment charges of $17.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The carrying value of coal land and real estate and the assets held for sale were zero as of December 31, 2017. 
North American Coal
General
NACoal operates surface mines that supply coal primarily to power generation companies under long-term contracts, and provides other value-added services to natural resource companies.  In addition, its NAM business operates and maintains draglines and other equipment under contracts with sellers of aggregates. 
Coal is surface-mined from NACoal's mines in North Dakota, Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana and on the Navajo Nation in New Mexico. NACoal has the following operating coal mining subsidiaries: Bisti, Caddo Creek Resources Company, LLC (“Caddo Creek”), Camino Real Fuels, LLC (“Camino Real”), The Coteau Properties Company (“Coteau”), Coyote Creek 
 1

Mining Company, LLC (“Coyote Creek”), Demery Resources Company, LLC (“Demery”), The Falkirk Mining Company (“Falkirk”), Mississippi Lignite Mining Company (“MLMC”) and The Sabine Mining Company (“Sabine”). Liberty ceased all mining and delivery of lignite in 2017 and commenced mine reclamation in 2018.
Coteau, Coyote, Falkirk, MLMC and Sabine supply lignite coal for power generation. Bisti and Camino Real supply sub-bituminous coal for power generation. Caddo Creek and Demery supply lignite coal for the production of activated carbon. Each of these mines deliver their coal production to adjacent or nearby power plants, synfuels plants or activated carbon processing facilities under long-term supply contracts. With the exception of Camino Real, each mine is the exclusive supplier to its customers' facilities.
All of the operating coal mining subsidiaries other than MLMC are unconsolidated. The unconsolidated coal mining subsidiaries were formed to develop, construct and/or operate surface coal mines under long-term contracts and are capitalized primarily with debt financing provided by or supported by their respective customers, and without recourse to NACCO and NACoal. 
MLMC is a consolidated entity because NACoal pays all operating costs and provides the capital for the mine. MLMC sells coal to its customer at a contractually agreed-upon price which adjusts monthly, primarily based on changes in the level of established indices which reflect general U.S. inflation rates.  MLMC's customer, KMRC RH, LLC until April 30, 2016 and Choctaw Generation Limited Partnership, LLLP subsequent to April 30, 2016, accounted for approximately 60%, 60% and 69% of NACoal's revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Centennial, which ceased coal production at the end of 2015, is also a consolidated entity.
NAM primarily provides value-added services for independently owned limestone quarries and is generally reimbursed by its customers based on production costs plus a management fee per unit of limestone delivered. NAM's largest customer, Cemex Construction Materials of Florida, LLC ("Cemex"), accounted for approximately 20%, 18% and 16% of NACoal's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The financial results for NAM are included in the consolidated mining operations or unconsolidated mining operations based on each entity's structure.
The contracts with the customers of the unconsolidated subsidiaries eliminate exposure to spot coal and aggregates market price fluctuations and are based on a "management fee" approach, whereby compensation includes reimbursement of all operating costs, plus a fee based on the amount of coal or limestone delivered. The fees earned adjust over time in line with various indices which reflect general U.S. inflation rates.  
NACoal also provides coal handling, processing and drying services for a number of customers. For example, NoDak Energy Services, LLC ("NoDak") operates and maintains a coal processing facility for a customer's power plant. North American Coal Royalty Company ("NACRC") provides surface and mineral acquisition and lease maintenance services related to the Company's operations and owns the mineral rights of various properties throughout the U.S.
NACoal's total coal reserves approximate 1.9 billion tons (including the unconsolidated coal mining subsidiaries), with approximately 1.0 billion tons committed to customers pursuant to long-term contracts. At December 31, 2018, NACoal's operating mines consisted both of mines where the reserves were acquired (whether in fee or through leases) and developed by NACoal, as well as mines where reserves are owned or leased by the customers of the mines and developed by NACoal.
The contracts under which certain of the unconsolidated subsidiaries operate provide that, under certain conditions, including default, the customer(s) involved may elect or be obligated to acquire the assets (subject to the liabilities) or the capital stock of the NACoal mining subsidiary for an amount effectively equal to book value. NACoal does not know of any conditions of default that currently exist.

Sales, Marketing and Operations
The principal coal customers of NACoal are electric utilities, an independent power provider, producers of activated carbon and a synfuels plant. The total coal severed by mine (in millions of tons) for the two years ended December 31 are as follows:

 | 2018 | 2017
Unconsolidated Mines | | 
Coteau | 14.2 | | 14.7
Falkirk | 8.2 | | 7.2 
Sabine | 3.5 | | 3.8 
Bisti | 3.4 | | 3.7 
Camino Real | 2.2 | | 2.4 
Coyote Creek | 2.5 | | 2.1 
Other | 0.4 | | 0.8 
Consolidated Mines | | 
Mississippi Lignite Mining Company | 2.9 | | 2.4 
Total tons severed | 37.3 | | 37.1

Seasonality
NACoal has experienced limited variability in its results due to the effect of seasonality; however, variations in coal demand can occur as a result of the timing of planned or unplanned outage days at NACoal's customers' facilities. Variations in coal demand can also occur as a result of changes in market prices of competing fuels such as natural gas, wind and solar power and demand for electricity, which can fluctuate based on changes in weather patterns.
Competition
The coal industry competes with other sources of energy, particularly oil, gas, hydro-electric power and nuclear power. In addition, it competes with subsidized sources of energy, primarily wind and solar. Among the factors that affect competition are the price and availability of oil and natural gas, environmental and related political considerations, the time and expenditures required to develop new energy sources, the cost of transportation, the cost of compliance with governmental regulations, the impact of federal and state energy policies and the impact of subsidies on renewable pricing. The ability of NACoal to maintain comparable levels of coal production at existing facilities and to market and develop its reserves will depend upon the interaction of these factors.
Based on industry information, NACoal believes it was one of the ten largest coal producers in the U.S. in 2018 based on total coal tons produced.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, NACoal had approximately 2,400 employees, including approximately 2,000 employees at the unconsolidated mining operations of which approximately 255 are represented by a union at Bisti. NACoal believes its current labor relations with both union and non-union employees are satisfactory.

The majority of the leases held by MLMC were originally acquired during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s with terms extending 50 years, many of which can be further extended by the continuation of mining operations.
The lignite deposits of the Gulf Coast are found primarily in a narrow band of strata that outcrops/subcrops along the margin of the Mississippi Embayment. The potentially exploitable tertiary lignites in Mississippi are found in the Wilcox Group. The outcropping Wilcox is composed predominately of non-marine sediments deposited on a broad flat plain.
Centennial Natural Resources 
Centennial ceased active mining operations at the end of 2015. Centennial and its affiliate, NACRC, own in fee approximately 5,648 acres of coal interests and approximately 2,331 acres of surface interests in Alabama. Centennial holds leases in Alabama granting the right to mine approximately 7,874 acres of coal interests and the right to utilize approximately 9,479 acres of surface interests. The majority of the leases held by Centennial were originally acquired between 2000 and 2012 with terms that can be extended by the continuation of mining activities.
North American Coal Royalty Company
No operating mines currently exist on the undeveloped coal reserves in Alabama, Mississippi, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. NACRC receives certain royalty payments based on the sale of oil and natural gas, primarily in Louisiana and Ohio, and, to a lesser extent, for coal located in Alabama, Mississippi, North Dakota and Pennsylvania, primarily extracted by third parties.

General Information about the Mines
Leases. The leases held by Coteau, Coyote Creek, Falkirk and MLMC have a variety of continuation provisions, but generally permit the leases to be continued beyond their fixed terms. Centennial holds the mining rights to the reserves within its mines through fee ownership, and leases and licenses from the coal and surface owners. NACoal expects coal will be available to meet customers' future production requirements utilizing land and reserves that are currently owned or leased or accessible through ownership acquisition or new leases.
Previous Operators. There were no previous operators of the Freedom Mine, Falkirk Mine, South Hallsville No. 1 Mine, Five Forks Mine, Marshall Mine, Eagle Pass Mine, Liberty Mine, Coyote Creek Mine or Red Hills Mine. In January 2017, Bisti became the operator of NTEC's Navajo Mine, which was previously operated by a third party. 
Exploration and Development. All mines are well past the exploration stage. With the exceptions of Centennial, which ceased production at the end of 2015, and Liberty, which commenced mine reclamation in 2018, additional pit development is under way at each mine. Drilling programs are routinely conducted for the purpose of refining guidance related to ongoing operations. For example, at the Red Hills Mine, the lignite coal reserve has been defined by a drilling program that is designed to provide 500-foot spaced drill holes for areas anticipated to be mined within six years of the current pit. Drilling beyond the six-year horizon ranges from 1,000 to 2,000-foot centers. Drilling is conducted annually to stay current with the advance of mining operations. Geological evaluation is in process at all operating locations.
Facilities and Equipment. The facilities and equipment for each of the mines are maintained to allow for safe and efficient operation. The equipment is well maintained, in good physical condition and is either updated or replaced periodically with newer models or upgrades available to keep up with modern technology. As equipment wears out, the mines evaluate what
replacement option will be the most cost-efficient, including the evaluation of both new and used equipment, and proceed with that replacement. The majority of electrical power for the draglines, shovels, coal crushers, coal conveyors and facilities generally is provided by the power generation customer for the applicable mine. Electrical power for the Sabine facilities is provided by Upshur Rural Electric Co-op. Electrical power for the Sabine dragline operating in the South Marshall permit area is provided by Southwestern Electric Power Company. Electrical power for the draglines operating in the Rusk permit area is provided by Rusk County Electric Co-op. Electrical power for the MLMC draglines and shovels is provided by 4-County Electric Power Association. The remainder of the equipment generally is powered by diesel fuel or gasoline.

Predominantly all of Bisti, Caddo Creek, Camino Real, Demery, Liberty and Unconsolidated NAM's machinery and equipment is owned by NACoal’s customers. 
Government Regulation
NACoal’s operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations on matters such as employee health and safety, and certain environmental laws relating to, among other matters, the reclamation and restoration of properties after mining operations, air pollution, water pollution, the disposal of wastes and effects on groundwater. In addition, the electric power generation industry is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities that could affect demand for coal from NACoal’s coal mining operations.
Numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for coal mining operations. NACoal or one of its subsidiaries holds or will hold the necessary permits at all of NACoal’s coal mining operations except at Demery, Caddo Creek, Bisti and Camino Real, where NACoal’s customers hold the respective permits. At NACoal’s operations in Alabama, Centennial holds all of the necessary permits except at two locations, where the permits are held by the coal reserve owner and another mining company.  The Company believes, based upon present information provided to it by these third-party mine permit holders, that these third parties have all permits necessary for NACoal to operate Centennial, Caddo Creek, Demery, Bisti and Camino Real; however, the Company cannot be certain that these third parties will be able to maintain all such permits in the future.
At the coal mining operations where NACoal holds the permits, NACoal is required to prepare and present to federal, state or local governmental authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of coal may have upon the environment and public and employee health and safety.
The limestone quarries where NACoal provides services are owned and operated by NACoal’s customers. 
Some laws, as discussed below, place many requirements on NACoal’s coal mining operations and the limestone quarries where NACoal provides services. Federal and state regulations require regular monitoring of NACoal’s operations to ensure compliance.
 12

Mine Health and Safety Laws
The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 imposes safety and health standards on all mining operations. Regulations are comprehensive and affect numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining procedures, blasting, the equipment used in mining operations and other matters. The Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration enforces compliance with these federal laws and regulations.
Environmental Laws
NACoal’s coal mining operations are subject to various federal environmental laws, as amended, including:

• | the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (“SMCRA”);


• | the Clean Air Act, including amendments to that act in 1990 (“CAA”);


• | the Clean Water Act of 1972 (“CWA”);


• | the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"); and


• | the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA").

In addition to these federal environmental laws, various states have enacted environmental laws that provide for higher levels of environmental compliance than similar federal laws. These state environmental laws require reporting, permitting and/or approval of many aspects of coal mining operations. Both federal and state inspectors regularly visit mines to enforce compliance. NACoal has ongoing training, compliance and permitting programs to ensure compliance with such environmental laws.
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act
SMCRA establishes mining, environmental protection and reclamation standards for all aspects of surface coal mining operations. Where state regulatory agencies have adopted federal mining programs under SMCRA, the state becomes the primary regulatory authority. With the exception of the Navajo Nation in New Mexico, which is directly regulated by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement ("OSM") under their Indian Lands Program, all of the states where NACoal has active coal mining operations have achieved primary control of enforcement through federal authorization under SMCRA.
Coal mine operators must obtain SMCRA permits and permit renewals for coal mining operations from the applicable regulatory agency. These SMCRA permit provisions include requirements for coal prospecting, mine plan development, topsoil removal, storage and replacement, selective handling of overburden materials, mine pit backfilling and grading, protection of the hydrologic balance, surface drainage control, mine drainage and mine discharge control and treatment, and revegetation.
Although NACoal’s permits have stated expiration dates, SMCRA provides for a right of successive renewal. The cost of obtaining surface mining permits can vary widely depending on the quantity and type of information that must be provided to obtain the permits; however, the cost of obtaining a permit is usually between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000, and the cost of obtaining a permit renewal is usually between $15,000 and $100,000.
The Abandoned Mine Land Fund, which is provided for by SMCRA, imposes a fee on certain coal mining operations. The proceeds are used principally to reclaim mine lands closed prior to 1977. In addition, the Abandoned Mine Land Fund also makes transfers annually to the United Mine Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund (the “Fund”), which provides health care benefits to retired coal miners who are beneficiaries of the Fund. The fee is currently $0.08 per ton on lignite coal produced and $0.28 per ton on other surface-mined coal.
SMCRA establishes operational, reclamation and closure standards for surface coal mines. The Company accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine closure, including the cost of treating mine water discharges, at mines where NACoal subsidiaries hold the mining permit. These obligations are unfunded with the exception of the final mine closure costs for the Coyote Creek Mine, which are being funded throughout the production stage.
SMCRA stipulates compliance with many other major environmental programs, including the CAA and CWA. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers regulates activities affecting navigable waters, and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms regulates the use of explosives for blasting. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the OSM are engaged in a series of rulemakings and other administrative actions under the CWA and other statutes that are directed at reducing the impact of coal mining operations on water bodies.
The Company does not believe there is any significant risk to NACoal’s ability to maintain its existing mining permits or its ability to acquire future mining permits for its mines.
 13

Clean Air Act and Clean Power Plan ("CPP")
The process of burning coal can cause many compounds and impurities in the coal to be released into the air, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, particulates and other matter. The CAA and the corresponding state laws that extensively regulate the emissions of materials into the air affect coal mining operations both directly and indirectly. Direct impacts on coal mining operations occur through CAA permitting requirements and/or emission control requirements relating to air contaminants, especially particulate matter. Indirect impacts on coal mining operations occur through regulation of the air emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, particulate matter and other compounds emitted by coal-fired power plants. The EPA has promulgated or proposed regulations that impose tighter emission restrictions in a number of areas, some of which are currently subject to litigation. The general effect of tighter restrictions is to reduce demand for coal. Ongoing reduction in coal’s share of the capacity for power generation could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
States are required to submit to the EPA revisions to their state implementation plans ("SIPs") that demonstrate the manner in which the states will attain national ambient air quality standards ("NAAQS") every time a NAAQS is issued or revised by the EPA. The EPA has adopted NAAQS for several pollutants, which continue to be reviewed periodically for revisions. When the EPA adopts new, more stringent NAAQS for a pollutant, some states have to change their existing SIPs. If a state fails to revise its SIP and obtain EPA approval, the EPA may adopt regulations to effect the revision. Coal mining operations and coal-fired power plants that emit particulate matter or other specified material are, therefore, affected by changes in the SIPs. Through this process over the last few years, the EPA has reduced the NAAQS for particulate matter, ozone, and nitrogen oxides. NACoal’s coal mining operations and power generation customers may be directly affected when the revisions to the SIPs are made and incorporate new NAAQS for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone and particulate matter. In response to a court remand of earlier rules to control the regional dispersion of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from coal-fired power plants and their impacts of downwind NAAQS areas, in mid-2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule ("CSAPR") to address interstate transport of pollutants. This affects states in the eastern half of the U.S. and Texas. This rule imposes additional emission restrictions on coal-fired power plants to attain ozone and fine particulate NAAQS. The EPA subsequently appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned the lower court ruling in 2014. The EPA began implementation of the rule in 2015, when Phase I emission reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide became effective. Phase II reductions became effective in 2017. On October 26, 2016, the EPA finalized an update to the CSAPR, which included additional reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions. Some questions regarding the rule remain unresolved and additional litigation is pending. In 2018, the EPA finalized all remaining ozone designations to comply with the 2015 ozone air quality standards. None of the power plants supplied by NACoal are within non-attainment areas for ozone. 
The CAA Acid Rain Control Provisions were promulgated as part of the CAA Amendments of 1990 in Title IV of the CAA (“Acid Rain Program”). The Acid Rain Program required reductions of sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. The Acid Rain Program is now a mature program, and the Company believes that any market impacts of the required controls have likely been factored into the coal market.
The EPA promulgated a regional haze program designed to protect and to improve visibility at and around Class I Areas, which are generally National Parks, National Wilderness Areas and International Parks. This program may restrict the construction of new coal-fired power plants, the operation of which may impair visibility at and around the Class I Areas. Additionally, the program requires certain existing coal-fired power plants to install additional control measures designed to limit haze-causing emissions, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particulate matter. States were required to submit Regional Haze SIPs to the EPA in 2007; however, many states did not meet that deadline. In 2016, the EPA finalized revisions to the Regional Haze Rule which addresses requirements for the second planning period. SIPs will be required by July 31, 2021. 
Under the CAA, new and modified sources of air pollution must meet certain new source standards (the “New Source Review Program”). In the late 1990s, the EPA filed lawsuits against owners of many coal-fired power plants in the eastern U.S. alleging that the owners performed non-routine maintenance, causing increased emissions that should have triggered the application of these new source standards. Some of these lawsuits have been settled with the owners agreeing to install additional emission control devices in their coal-fired power plants. The EPA published draft revisions to the New Source Review Program in December 2018 and revisions to the program are anticipated to be completed in 2019. The remaining litigation and the uncertainty around the New Source Review Program rules could adversely impact demand for coal. Any additional new controls may have an adverse impact on the demand for coal, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
Under the CAA, the EPA also adopts national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants. In December 2011, the EPA adopted a final rule called the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (“MATS”), which applies to new and existing coal-fired and 
 14

oil-fired units. This rule requires mercury emission reductions in fine particulates, which are being regulated as a surrogate for certain metals. 
NACoal’s power generation customers must incur substantial costs to control emissions to meet all of the CAA requirements, including the requirements under MATS and the EPA's regional haze program. These costs raise the price of coal-generated electricity, making coal-fired power less competitive with other sources of electricity, thereby reducing demand for coal. In addition, NACoal's power generation customers may choose to close coal-fired generation units or to postpone or cancel plans to add new capacity, in light of these costs and the limited time available for compliance with the requirements and the prospects of the imposition of additional future requirements on emissions from coal-fired units. If NACoal's customers cannot offset the cost to control certain regulated pollutant emissions by lowering costs or if NACoal's customers elect to close coal-fired units, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
Global climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention and a considerable amount of legislative and regulatory attention in the United States. The U.S. Congress has considered climate change legislation that would reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, particularly from coal combustion by power plants. Enactment of laws and passage of regulations regarding GHG emissions by the U.S. or additional states, or other actions to limit carbon dioxide emissions, such as opposition by environmental groups to expansion or modification of coal-fired power plants, could result in electric generators switching from coal to other fuel sources.
The U.S. Congress continues to consider a variety of proposals to reduce GHG emissions from the combustion of coal and other fuels. These proposals include emission taxes, emission reductions, including carbon tax and “cap-and-trade” programs, and mandates or incentives to generate electricity by using renewable resources, such as wind or solar power. Some states have established programs to reduce GHG emissions. Further, governmental agencies have been providing grants or other financial incentives to entities developing or selling alternative energy sources with lower levels of GHG emissions, which may lead to more competition from those entities.
The EPA has begun to establish a GHG regulation program under the CAA by issuing a finding that the emission of six GHGs, including carbon dioxide and methane, may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare. Based on this finding, the EPA published a New Source Performance Standard for greenhouse gases, emitted from future new power plants. On June 2, 2014, the EPA proposed new regulations limiting carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants. On June 18, 2014, the EPA also issued a proposed carbon dioxide emission regulation for reconstructed and modified power plants, which addresses carbon dioxide emissions limits for power plants subsequent to modification. 
In 2015, President Obama and the EPA announced the CPP, which included final emission guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to reduce GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units ("EGUs") as well as limits on GHG emission rates for new, modified and reconstructed EGUs. Under the CPP, nationwide carbon dioxide emissions would be reduced by 32% from 2005 levels by 2030 with emissions reductions scheduled to be phased in between 2022 and 2030. In 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the CPP pending resolution of litigation challenging the CPP. As directed by Executive Order by President Trump (“Executive Order”), on April 4, 2017, the EPA issued a proposed rule announcing its intention to review the CPP, and, if appropriate, initiate proceedings to suspend, revise or rescind it. On August 21, 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule, which would establish emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address GHG emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. The ACE rule would replace the CPP, which the EPA has proposed to repeal. If finalized as proposed, it is expected that the ACE would generally require a lower level of emission reductions than the CPP and provide more regulatory flexibility to individual states. 
The U.S. has not implemented the 1992 Framework Convention on Global Climate Change (“Kyoto Protocol”), which became effective for many countries on February 16, 2005. The Kyoto Protocol was intended to limit or reduce emissions of GHGs. The U.S. has not ratified the emission targets of the Kyoto Protocol or any other GHG agreement. Though the U.S. has not accepted these international GHG limiting treaties, numerous lawsuits and regulatory actions have been undertaken by states and environmental groups to try to force controls on the emission of carbon dioxide; or to prevent the construction of new coal-fired power plants. In 2014, President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping jointly announced each nation's intentions to limit GHG emissions. These were non-binding statements of intent. 
As a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, on December 12, 2015, international negotiators finalized the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“Paris Agreement”). Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement has no binding GHG reduction mandates on signatories. Participating countries only submit a description of their intended GHG reductions, and provide periodic progress updates, with no penalties for not meeting their self-imposed targets. The Paris Agreement also includes language stating that developed countries will provide financial assistance to help developing countries meet their GHG targets and adapt to climate change, but there are no mandated contributions. President 
 15

Obama signed this as a sole executive agreement on September 3, 2016. On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States will withdraw from the non-binding Paris Agreement and begin renegotiation of its terms or establish a new framework agreement. The renegotiation and implementation of the Paris Agreement, or other international agreements, the regulations promulgated to date by the EPA with respect to GHG emissions or the adoption of new legislation or regulations to control GHG emissions, could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Significant public opposition has also been raised with respect to the proposed construction of certain new coal-fueled EGUs due to the potential for increased air emissions. Such opposition, as well as any corporate or investor policies against coal-fired EGUs or requiring disclosures related to global climate change, could also reduce the demand for NACoal’s coal or marketability of NACCO stock. Further, policies limiting available financing for the development of new coal-fueled EGUs or coal mines or the retrofitting of existing EGUs could adversely impact the global demand for coal in the future. The potential impact on NACoal of future laws, regulations or other policies or circumstances will depend upon the degree to which any such laws, regulations or other policies or circumstances force electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. In view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these factors, it is not possible for us to predict reasonably the impact that any such laws, regulations or other policies may have on NACoal’s business, financial condition and results of operations. However, such impacts could have a material adverse effect on NACoal’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Company believes NACoal has obtained all necessary permits under the CAA at all of its coal mining operations where it is responsible for permitting and is in compliance with such permits.
Clean Water Act
The Clean Water Act ("CWA") affects coal mining operations by establishing in-stream water quality standards and treatment standards for waste water discharge. Permits requiring regular monitoring, reporting and performance standards govern the discharge of pollutants into water.
Federal and state regulations establish standards that prohibit the diminution of water quality. Waters discharged from coal mines are required to meet these standards. These federal and state requirements could require more costly water treatment and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Company believes NACoal has obtained all permits required under the CWA and corresponding state laws and is in compliance with such permits. In many instances, mining operations require securing CWA authorization or a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for operations in waters of the United States. 
Bellaire Corporation, a wholly owned non-operating subsidiary of the Company (“Bellaire”), is treating mine water drainage from coal refuse piles associated with two former underground coal mines in Ohio and one former underground coal mine in Pennsylvania, and is treating mine water from a former underground coal mine in Pennsylvania. Bellaire anticipates that it will need to continue these activities indefinitely. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company's asset retirement obligations.
Bellaire was notified by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection ("DEP") during 2004 that in order to obtain renewal of a permit, Bellaire would be required to establish a mine water treatment trust (the "Trust"). Prior to 2014, Bellaire funded the Trust with $5.0 million. See Note 7 and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on the Trust.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") affects coal mining operations by establishing requirements for the treatment, storage and disposal of wastes, including hazardous wastes. Coal mine wastes, such as overburden and coal cleaning wastes, currently are exempted from hazardous waste management. In December 2014, the EPA finalized a rule specifying management standards for coal combustion residuals or coal ash ("CCRs") as a non-hazardous waste. In 2018, the EPA finalized revisions to the 2014 regulations in response to litigation of the 2014 rule. One revision allows a state director (in a state with an approved CCR permit program) or the EPA (where EPA is the permitting authority) to suspend groundwater monitoring requirements if there is evidence that there is no potential for migration of hazardous constituents to the uppermost aquifer during the active life of the unit and post closure care. The second revision allows issuance of technical certifications in lieu of a professional engineer. In addition, the EPA revised the groundwater protection standards and extended the deadline for 
 16

some facilities that must close CCR units. These standards may raise the cost for CCR disposal at coal-fired power plants, making them less competitive, and may have an adverse impact on demand for coal. 
The EPA rule exempts CCRs disposed of at mine sites and reserves any regulation thereof to the OSM. The OSM recently suspended all rulemaking actions on CCRs, but could re-initiate them in the future. The outcome of these rulemakings, and any subsequent actions by EPA and OSM, could impact those NACoal operations that beneficially use CCRs. If NACoal were unable to beneficially use CCRs, its revenues for disposing of CCRs from its customers may decrease and its costs may increase due to the purchase of alternative materials for beneficial uses. 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and similar state laws create liabilities for the investigation and remediation of releases of hazardous substances into the environment and for damages to natural resources. The Company must also comply with reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act.
From time to time, the Company has been the subject of administrative proceedings, litigation and investigations relating to environmental matters.
The extent of the liability and the cost of complying with environmental laws cannot be predicted with certainty due to many factors, including the lack of specific information available with respect to many sites, the potential for new or changed laws and regulations, the development of new remediation technologies and the uncertainty regarding the timing of work with respect to particular sites. As a result, the Company may incur material liabilities or costs related to environmental matters in the future, and such environmental liabilities or costs could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, there can be no assurance that changes in laws or regulations would not affect the manner in which NACoal is required to conduct its operations.
