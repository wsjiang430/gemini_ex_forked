Item 1. Description of Business.
Overview
 
We are an emerging technology company in China engaged in (i) providing smart security solutions primarily to schools, scenic areas and public communities and (ii) developing education-related technologies. We leverage our proprietary technologies, intellectual property, innovative products and market intelligence to provide comprehensive and optimized security solutions and education-related technologies to our clients. We have been certified as one of the Zhongguancun High Tech Enterprises (issued by the Zhongguancun Science Park Administrative Committee) in recognition of our achievement in high technology products. Our security and technology engineers and experts create, design, build and run various security systems and education technologies tailored to our clients’ needs. Through our professional team and strong expertise in the industry, we offer our clients a broad portfolio of security solutions, along with strategic advice and ongoing management of their security infrastructure, and digital education tools or programs.
 
We have developed three smart security products: the safe campus security system, the scenic area security system, and the public community security system. As of the date of this report, the safe campus security system has entered the market and is used by many schools in China. The scenic area security system is in the testing phase and is expected to enter the market during calendar year 2020. Our public community security system is also in the testing phase and cannot yet predict when this system will be ready for the market.
 
We market and sell our smart security products, services and solutions to governments, enterprises, institutions, families and individuals through our distributors and city government partners. Although we have generated very little revenues to date, we expect to generate revenues from sales of software systems, installation of the systems, including its software and hardware, upgrades of hardware, and support and maintenance services.
 
In addition, as a value-added service to our safe campus security system, we develop and offer education-related technologies to build campus networks, education management systems, education cloud platforms, science education platform and other education systems used in schools. We expect to generate revenues from sales of software sales, installation of the systems, including software and hardware, and supporting and maintenance services.
 
Recent Developments
 
On December 21, 2018, we successfully completed a registered, underwritten initial public offering and concurrent listing of the our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market, which offering generated gross proceeds of $6.7 million before deducting underwriter’s commissions and other offering costs, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $5.7 million (“2018 Offering”), of which $1,000,000 was placed in an escrow account. $600,000 of the escrow fund is being held by the escrow agent pursuant to the terms and conditions of a certain Indemnification Escrow Agreement between us and the underwriter of the offering. $400,000 of the escrow fund was disbursed to the Company in February 2019 when the underwriter confirmed receipt of a written legal opinion from PRC legal counsel in connection with such offering. In the 2018 Offering, we sold 1,667,500 shares of common stock (including shares issued pursuant to the underwriter’s over-allotment option) at an offering price of $4 per share. In connection with the 2018 Offering, our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market beginning on December 19, 2018 under the symbol “DTSS.” 
 
During our fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we collaborated with China Association for Promoting of International Economic &Technological Cooperation (CAIETC), Zhongguancun Digital Culture Industry Alliance and the government of Xuanwu District, Nanjing Province to further expand our footprint. In July 2019, we began working with Shanghai Liangzhi Information Technology Co., Ltd. to establish an education product research and development center in Shanghai. We also collaborated with Beijing Chuangyan zhixing Education Technology Co., Ltd. to develop and promote an essential-qualities-oriented education (the so-called Suzhi education) platform. This platform will be introduced to schools across China.
 
Due to uncertainties of government policies, we determined to cease our smart elevator business and our collaboration with Minsheng Bank; due to low profitability, we determined to cease our cybersecurity system and equipment business.

History
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 26, 2014 under the name Rose Rock Inc. On May 27, 2015, we amended our articles of incorporation to change our name to Datasea Inc. Up until October 2015, our primary business activities were providing consulting services to various U.S. companies seeking to do business in China as well as Chinese companies looking to enter the U.S. markets. Nonetheless, we were considered a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Act, as we had no or nominal business operations, employees and/or assets.
 
On May 26, 2015, pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement, Ms. Zhixin Liu purchased 20,000,000 shares (without giving effect to our one-for-three reverse stock split that became effective on May 1, 2018), or 57.14%, of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock from Mr. Xingzhong Sun, who was our sole officer, director and majority shareholder at the time of the transaction. As part of the transaction, Zhixin Liu was appointed as the Chairman of our Board of Directors (the “Board”). 
 
On October 29, 2015, we entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Ms. Zhixin Liu and Mr. Fu Liu, the members (“Members”) of Datasea Skill (HK) Limited (“Shuhai Skill (HK)”), a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the PRC, whereby the Members transferred all of their membership interests of Shuhai Skill (HK) to us in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares* of our common stock (the transaction, hereinafter referred to as the “Share Exchange”). Upon consummation of the Share Exchange, Shuhai Skill (HK) and its consolidated subsidiaries, Tianjin Information Sea Information Technology Co., Ltd., a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the PRC (“Tianjin Information”), became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Shuahi Information Technology Co., Ltd., also a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the PRC (“Shuhai Beijing”), through its existing contractual relationship with Tianjin Information, became our variable interest entity (“VIE”). In addition, Xinzhong Sun resigned from the positions as our director, President, Secretary and Treasurer. Ms. Liu was appointed as our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary and Mr. Liu was appointed as a director. Mr. Liu is the father of Ms. Liu.
 
As a result of the Share Exchange, we, through our consolidated subsidiaries, are engaged in the business of providing Internet security products, new media advertising, micro-marketing, data analysis services in the PRC. All business operations are conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Tianjin Information, and through Shuhai Beijing, our VIE. Shuhai Beijing is considered to be a VIE because we do not have any direct ownership interest in it, but, as a result of a series of contractual agreements (the “VIE Contractual Agreements”) among Tianjin Information, Shuhai Beijing and its shareholders, we are able to exert effective control over Shuhai Beijing and receive 100% of the net profits or net losses derived from the business operations of Shuhai Beijing. The VIE Contractual Agreements are more fully described below.
 
On April 12, 2018, our board of directors and stockholders approved a one-for-three reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, which became effective on May 1, 2018, decreasing the number of outstanding shares from 57,511,771 to 19,170,827. Subsequent to the split, the number of our outstanding shares of our common stock increased from to 19,170,827 to 19,170,846 to accommodate certain shareholders’ positions due to rounding elections payable at the beneficial owner level. Unless otherwise stated, all shares and per share amounts in this report have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to this stock split.
