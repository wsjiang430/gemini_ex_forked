Item 1. Business
Our Company
Capri Holdings Limited (“Capri”) is a global fashion luxury group, consisting of iconic brands that are industry leaders in design, style and craftsmanship. Our brands cover the full spectrum of fashion luxury categories including women’s and men’s accessories, footwear and ready-to-wear, as well as wearable technology, watches, jewelry, eyewear and a full line of fragrance products. Our goal is to continue to extend the global reach of our brands while ensuring that they maintain their independence and exclusive DNA.
Our Brands
Versace
The Versace brand has long been recognized as one of the world’s leading international fashion design houses and is synonymous with Italian glamour and style. Founded over 40 years ago in Milan, Italy, Versace is known for its iconic and unmistakable style and unparalleled craftsmanship. Over the past several decades, the House of Versace has grown globally from its roots in haute couture, expanding into the design, manufacturing, distribution and retailing of ready-to-wear, accessories, footwear and home furnishings businesses. Versace distributes its products through a worldwide distribution network which includes boutiques in some of the world’s most glamorous cities. In addition, certain categories, such as jeans, fragrances, watches and eyewear are produced under licensing agreements.
Jimmy Choo
The Jimmy Choo brand, founded over 20 years ago, enjoys a leading position in the luxury footwear market and an expanding presence in the luxury accessories space. Since its inception in 1996, Jimmy Choo has offered a distinctive, glamorous and fashion-forward product range, enabling it to develop into a leading global luxury accessories brand, whose core product offering of women’s luxury shoes is complemented by accessories, including handbags, small leather goods, scarves and belts, as well as a men’s luxury shoes and accessory business. In addition, certain categories, such as fragrances and eyewear are produced under licensing agreements.
Michael Kors
The Michael Kors brand was launched over 35 years ago by Michael Kors, whose vision has taken it from its beginnings as an American luxury sportswear house to a global accessories, footwear and apparel company with a presence in over 100 countries through company-operated retail stores and e-commerce sites, leading department stores, specialty stores and select licensing partners. Michael Kors offers three primary collections: the Michael Kors Collection luxury line, the MICHAEL Michael Kors accessible luxury line and the Michael Kors Mens line. The Michael Kors Collection establishes the aesthetic authority of the entire brand and is carried in many of our Michael Kors retail stores, our Michael Kors e-commerce sites, as well as in the finest luxury department stores in the world. Our accessible luxury line MICHAEL Michael Kors has a strong focus on accessories, in addition to offering footwear and apparel and is carried in all of our Michael Kors lifestyle stores, as well as leading department stores throughout the world. We also continue to develop our Michael Kors Mens business in recognition of the significant opportunity afforded by our Michael Kors brand’s established fashion authority.

Our Segments
Prior to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, we organized our business into four reportable segments: MK Retail, MK Wholesale, MK Licensing and Jimmy Choo. As a result of our acquisition of Versace, effective beginning in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, we realigned our reportable segments according to the new structure of our business. As a result, we now operate in three reportable segments, which are as follows:

• | Versace — accounted for approximately 3% of our total revenue in Fiscal 2019 (from the date of acquisition on December 31, 2018 through February 28, 2019, due to a one-month reporting lag) and includes worldwide sales of Versace products through 188 retail stores (including concessions) and e-commerce sites, through 1,028 wholesale doors (including multi-brand stores and non-core business lines that we are exiting), as well as through product and geographic licensing arrangements.


• | Jimmy Choo — accounted for approximately 11% of our total revenue in Fiscal 2019 and includes worldwide sales of Jimmy Choo products through 208 retail stores (including concessions) and e-commerce sites, through 596 wholesale doors, as well as through product and geographic licensing arrangements.


• | Michael Kors — accounted for approximately 86% of our total revenue in Fiscal 2019 and includes worldwide sales of Michael Kors products through 853 retail stores (including concessions) and e-commerce sites, through 3,202 wholesale doors, as well as through product and geographic licensing arrangements.

In addition to these reportable segments, we have certain corporate costs that are not directly attributable to our brands and, therefore, are not allocated to segments. Such costs primarily include certain administrative, corporate occupancy and information systems expenses, including Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system implementation costs. In addition, certain other costs are not allocated to our reportable segments, including restructuring and other charges (including transaction and transition costs related to our recent acquisitions) and impairment costs. The new segment structure is consistent with how we plan and allocate resources, manage our business and assess our performance. All prior period segment information has been recast to reflect the realignment of our segment reporting structure on a comparable basis. For additional financial information regarding our segments and corporate unallocated expenses, see Segment Information note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Industry
We operate in the global luxury goods industry. The personal luxury goods market has recently experienced increased growth, driven by stronger Chinese demand from both international and local consumers and demographic and socioeconomic shifts resulting in younger consumers purchasing more luxury goods. Accessories remains the largest and fastest growing personal luxury goods category, driven by handbags and footwear. Over the past several years, retail has been the fastest-growing channel, largely driven by the rapid and accelerating growth of the e-commerce channel, which is expected to represent 25% of personal luxury goods sales by 2025. Consumer shopping preferences have continued to shift from physical stores to on-line shopping. As the overall retail environment becomes increasingly omni-channel, with point of sales evolving into point of touch, we believe that increased customer engagement and tailoring merchandise to customer shopping and communication preferences are the key ingredients to growing market share. We believe that our innovative and luxurious product offerings and customer engagement initiatives across all three brands position us to capitalize on the continued growth of the luxury accessories and footwear product categories, as they are among our primary product categories of focus, as well as to grow our sales in our other product categories, such as ready-to-wear where we now have a broader presence across both women’s and men’s offerings.
Geographic Information
We generate revenue globally through our three reporting segments, as described above. We sell our Versace, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors products through retail and wholesale channels of distribution in three principal geographic markets: the Americas (U.S., Canada and Latin America), EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Asia. We also have wholesale arrangements pursuant to which we sell products to our geographic licensees. In addition, we have licensing agreements through which we license to third parties the use of our Versace, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors brand names and trademarks, certain production rights, and sales and/or distribution rights with respect to our brands.

Competitive Strengths
We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors:
Global Fashion Luxury Group Led by a World-Class Management Team and Renowned Designers. We are a global fashion luxury group, consisting of three iconic brands defined by fashion luxury products with a reputation for world-class design and innovation. The design leadership of our founder-designers Donatella Versace, Sandra Choi and Michael Kors is a unique advantage that we possess. Our founder-led design teams are supported by our senior management team with extensive experience across a broad range of disciplines in the retail industry, including design, sales, marketing, public relations, merchandising, real estate, supply chain and finance. With an average of 24 years of experience in the retail industry, including at a number of public companies, and an average of 12 years experience with our brands, our senior management team has strong creative and operational experience and a successful track record.
For over 20 years, Donatella Versace has been the artistic director, molding Versace’s iconic style. A true visionary with an intuition for how to blend fashion, design and culture, Donatella continues to honor the rich and storied Versace heritage founded in 1978, while constantly evolving and adapting the luxury house to ensure the brand’s continued relevance. Donatella’s most recent collections for the House of Versace are a testament to Donatella’s unique design vision and are equal parts bold and refined, evoking both a rock and roll spirit as well as runway glamour. Versace designs have been worn by the world’s most famous celebrities and most sought-after super models.
Jimmy Choo’s design team is led by Sandra Choi, who has been the Creative Director for the Jimmy Choo brand since its inception in 1996. Jimmy Choo products are unique, instinctively seductive and chic. The Jimmy Choo brand offers classic and timeless luxury products, as well as innovative products that are intended to set and lead fashion trends. Jimmy Choo’s products have a strong red carpet presence and are often worn by global celebrities.
6

The Michael Kors brand was launched over 35 years ago by Mr. Michael Kors, a world-renowned designer, who is responsible for conceptualizing and directing the design of our Michael Kors products. We believe that the Michael Kors brand name has become synonymous with luxurious fashion that is timeless and elegant, expressed through the brand’s sophisticated accessories and ready-to-wear collections. Each of our Michael Kors collections exemplifies the jet-set lifestyle and features high quality designs, materials and craftsmanship. Mr. Kors has received a number of awards, which recognize the contribution Mr. Kors and his team have made to the fashion industry and our Company. Some of the most widely recognized global trendsetters and celebrities wear our Michael Kors collections.
Expertise in the Accessories and Footwear Product Categories. We have strong group expertise in accessories and footwear. The strength of our Michael Kors luxury collection and our accessible luxury MICHAEL Michael Kors line have allowed us to expand our brand awareness and position Michael Kors as one of the leading global luxury brands in the accessories product categories. Capitalizing on the success of our accessories product category, we have begun to further develop the accessories businesses for Jimmy Choo and Versace, bringing our accessories expertise, including our product category knowledge, our merchandising best practices and our substantial group buying power to these brands. Our goal is to increase Versace’s accessories and footwear penetration from less than 35% of revenues in Fiscal 2019 to 60% of Versace’s revenues over time, and to increase Jimmy Choo's accessories penetration from less than 22% of revenues in Fiscal 2019 to 50% of Jimmy Choo’s revenues over time. 
Exceptional Retail Store Footprint. Versace operates in three primary retail formats: boutiques, outlet and e-commerce. We operated 188 Versace retail stores as of March 30, 2019, in some of the most glamorous cities and the most sought-after shopping destinations around the world.Versace’s products are distributed worldwide through a global network of highly specialized stores, which average approximately 1,700 square feet. In addition, we operate Versace e-commerce sites in the U.S., certain parts of Europe and China.
We operated 208 Jimmy Choo stores as of March 30, 2019, with approximately 77% of stores represented by the brand’s new global retail store format, which has been progressively rolled out around the world during the past several years. Jimmy Choo retail stores, comprised of full-price stores and outlets, average approximately 1,300 square feet. In addition, we operate Jimmy Choo e-commerce sites in the U.S., certain parts of Europe and Japan. During Fiscal 2019, omni-channel capabilities have been rolled out to Jimmy Choo in the U.S, Europe and Japan.
We operated 853 Michael Kors stores as of March 30, 2019 with four primary retail store formats: collection stores, lifestyle stores, outlet stores and e-commerce sites. Michael Kors collection stores are located in some of the world’s most prestigious shopping areas, such as Madison Avenue in New York and Rodeo Drive in California, and average approximately 2,900 square feet in size. The Michael Kors lifestyle stores are located in some of the world’s most frequented metropolitan shopping locations and leading regional shopping centers, and average approximately 2,800 square feet in size. We also extend our reach to additional consumer groups through our outlet stores, which average approximately 4,300 square feet in size. In addition, we also operate Michael Kors e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, certain parts of Europe, China, Japan and South Korea.
World-class Omni and CRM capabilities. We have omni-channel capabilities from best-in-class digital platforms to state-of-the-art distribution facilities globally, which we will look to leverage across businesses, including the newly acquired Versace business and our Jimmy Choo business. As part of our plan to continue to implement omni-channel capabilities throughout our businesses, we plan to leverage our world class distribution centers, including in Venlo, Netherlands, to serve all three brands over time. We also plan to invest in a new third party operated distribution center in New Jersey, which will service all three of our brands. Finally, we plan to introduce omni-channel capabilities to Versace and continue the expansion of our store order fulfillment and in-store pick up capabilities.
Strong Relationships with Premier Department Stores. We partner with leading wholesale customers, such as Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s in North America, as well as Harrods, Harvey Nichols, Printemps, Selfridges and Galeries Lafayette in Europe. These relationships enable us to access large numbers of our key consumers in a targeted manner. Our “shop-in-shops” have specially trained staff, as well as customized fixtures, wall casings, decorative items, and flooring, and provide department store consumers with a more personalized shopping experience than traditional retail department store configurations. We have engaged with our wholesale customers on various initiatives and have continued to enter into innovative supply chain partnerships designed to increase the speed at which our luxury fashion products reach the ultimate consumer. We plan to increase Versace’s and Jimmy Choo’s presence in luxury department stores and for Michael Kors, we have continued to strategically reduce shipments with the intent to drive more full-price sell throughs in the wholesale channel.

Business Strategy
Our goal is to continue to create shareholder value by increasing our revenue and profits and strengthening our global brands. We plan to achieve our business strategy by focusing on the following five strategic initiatives:
Leverage group expertise and capabilities. We will continue to leverage our group expertise in accessories and footwear to fuel growth across our portfolio of brands, implementing the best practices from our Michael Kors core accessories business to our Versace and Jimmy Choo brands. We will also continue to prioritize the development of our e-commerce platforms and omni-channel capabilities for our brands, leveraging our broad expertise and capabilities in this area. With the addition of Versace, we see a number of opportunities to create long-term operational synergies as we combine our global competencies and footprint. These synergies will be primarily focused on opportunities in our supply chain, information systems, back office support and manufacturing.
Continue to increase our presence in Asia. We plan to continue to diversify our group’s global footprint with an emphasis on the fast-growing Asia market, where we believe each of our three brands continue to have the potential to significantly grow market share in the region.
Integrate Versace and continue to build on the brand’s luxury image. We plan to grow the Versace business to $2 billion in revenues over time. There are five strategic initiatives that we will focus on to achieve this goal. First, we plan to build on Versace’s luxury runway momentum. Second, we will enhance Versace’s powerful and iconic communications messaging. Third, we plan to increase Versace’s global footprint from 188 stores to 300 retail stores. Fourth, we will accelerate Versace’s e-commerce development to create a full omni-channel experience. Finally, we plan to leverage our group’s expertise to expand Versace’s mens and womens accessories and footwear businesses from less than 35% of revenues to a target of 60% of the brand's revenues over time, while maintaining Versace’s authoritative presence in women’s and men’s ready-to-wear.
Continue to execute on our strategies to grow the Jimmy Choo brand. We plan to continue to implement our growth strategies for Jimmy Choo, with a goal of reaching $1 billion in revenues over time. Since the acquisition, we have grown Jimmy Choo’s retail store base from 150 stores to over 200 stores and are targeting to expand the Jimmy Choo retail footprint to 275 stores globally, with an emphasis on growth in Asia. Maintaining our leadership in footwear for Jimmy Choo remains a top priority, and we plan to accelerate footwear growth by continuing to expand the strategic fashion active category. In addition, we plan to continue increasing our presence in the accessories product category by expanding the breadth of new collection offerings, focusing on visual merchandising and increased marketing, with a goal of growing the accessories business to 50% of Jimmy Choo's revenues. We also plan to continue to build Jimmy Choo's men's business by expanding the men's fashion active category, growing the accessory offerings, growing the distribution network and through new marketing initiatives. Our new marketing campaign, featuring Jimmy Choo’s first global brand ambassador, model Kaia Gerber, aims to attract a younger customer, while simultaneously highlighting our new active footwear and accessories products, in addition to continuing to showcase our core luxury women’s fashion footwear.
Continue to leverage the strength of our Michael Kors brand, which remains the foundation for our fashion luxury group. Our goal is to grow our Michael Kors brand to $5 billion in revenues over the next few years through product innovation, brand engagement and customer experience. Our focus on product innovation has greatly improved newness across all product categories for our Michael Kors brand. In accessories, we continue to introduce new product groups, as well as unique design, style, and craftsmanship. In footwear, we plan to grow our fashion active product offerings and continue fashion innovation. In women’s apparel, our KORS style head-to-toe dressing remains our key focus, along with our strategic dress and outerwear categories. We will continue to increase product offerings within menswear, including our new mens footwear collection. In addition, we will work to expand our Michael Kors ACCESS smartwatch and new Michael Kors fine jewelry collections distribution. We also plan to continue to focus on brand engagement, capitalizing on Michael Kors’ leading red carpet and social media presence. Our strategy to enhance customer experience by expanding our omni-channel capabilities and renovating stores also remains a key priority.

Advertising and Marketing
Our marketing strategy is to deliver a brand and product message that is consistent with each of our global brands across all customer touch points on their path from brand consideration through purchase. Each brand’s global image is created and executed internally by our creative marketing, visual merchandising and public relations teams, which help to ensure the consistency of each brand’s unique messaging.
During Fiscal 2019, we began our efforts to increase marketing exposure for Versace with the first ever Versace New York fashion runway show in December. The show was a testament to Donatella’s unique design vision and fused the sartorial heritage of Milan with the energy of New York. Versace’s unmistakable looks, which were bold and refined, evoked both a rock and roll spirit and a runway glamour. The show drew press and celebrities from around the world. The reviews, press coverage and social media generated from the show continue to expand the global reach of Versace. For our Jimmy Choo brand, we appointed Victoria Song Qian as our first ever brand ambassador in Asia, and Kaia Gerber was the face of Jimmy Choo’s Spring/Summer 2019 campaign. With her timeless beauty and fashion pedigree, Kaia’s authenticity transcends generations and is the perfect representation of the dynamic energy of the Jimmy Choo brand. For our Michael Kors brand, we continued to work with our global brand ambassador Yang Mi and introduced two new Asia brand ambassadors in South Korea and Japan. For Spring/Summer 2019, Michael has created an exciting campaign for our MICHAEL Michael Kors line featuring supermodel Bella Hadid as the new face of our brand. Bella instantly telegraphs the lifestyle, attitude and mood that is quintessentially jet-set. The imagery reflects the speed, energy and optimism that are the hallmarks of our Company.
In Fiscal 2019, we recognized approximately $158 million in advertising and marketing expenses globally. We engage in a wide range of integrated marketing programs across various marketing channels, including but not limited to email marketing, print advertising, outdoor advertising, digital marketing, social media, direct print mailings, public relations outreach, visual merchandising and partnership marketing, in an effort to engage our existing and potential customer base and ultimately stimulate sales in a consumer-preferred shopping venue. In addition, our Versace and Michael Kors Spring and Fall ready-to-wear collections, along with our latest accessories, are showcased at New York and Milan Fashion Weeks. The Versace and Michael Kors semi-annual runway shows and Jimmy Choo celebrity placements generate extensive media coverage. Jimmy Choo is also the leading brand in editorial coverage for women’s luxury shoes globally.
Our growing e-commerce businesses provide us with an opportunity to increase the size of our customer database and to communicate with our consumers to increase online and physical store sales, as well as to continue to build global brand awareness for our brands. We are continuously improving the functionalities and features on our e-commerce sites to create innovative ways to keep our brands at the forefront of consumers’ minds by offering a broad selection of products, including accessories, apparel, and footwear. Since e-commerce growth is critical to our overall growth strategy, we plan to accelerate Versace’s and Jimmy Choo’s e-commerce and omni-channel development, while continuing to work with select e-commerce partners.
Manufacturing and Sourcing
We generally contract for the purchase of finished goods principally with independent third-party manufacturing contractors, whereby the manufacturing contractor is generally responsible for the entire manufacturing process, including the purchase of piece goods and trim for our Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors brands. For the Versace brand, some of the piece goods and trim are separately purchased by Versace and provided to the manufacturers, and some are sourced directly by the manufacturers, as further described below.
Versace has a centrally managed production model for the majority of its products, and buys raw materials and components for these products. All raw materials arrive in a central warehouse in Novara, Italy and are distributed to independent third-party manufacturing contractors after the quality control process is complete. The vast majority of Versace’s production is located in Italy. The remaining production occurs in Turkey, Tunisia, elsewhere in Europe and a small portion is produced in Asia.
10

Jimmy Choo products are also manufactured by independent third-party manufacturing contractors. Most of Jimmy Choo’s products are produced by specialists in Florence and the Veneto region of Italy, with a small portion produced in Spain and China. Jimmy Choo has a product development facility in Florence. Jimmy Choo has a 33% ownership interest in one factory, which is dedicated to Jimmy Choo production. Jimmy Choo typically purchases finished goods and does not purchase raw materials, except for product development purposes.
Michael Kors contracts for the purchase of finished goods principally with independent third-party manufacturing contractors that are generally responsible for the entire manufacturing process, including the purchase of piece goods and trim. Product manufacturing for the Michael Kors brand is allocated among third-party agents based on their capabilities, the availability of production capacity, pricing and delivery. Michael Kors also has relationships with various agents who source finished goods with numerous manufacturing contractors on its behalf. This multi-supplier strategy provides specialist skills, scalability, flexibility and speed to market, as well as diversifies risk. In Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, one third-party agent sourced approximately 24% of Michael Kors finished goods purchases, in each period, based on unit volume. Michael Kors’ largest manufacturing contractor, who produces its products in Asia and who Michael Kors has worked with for over 10 years, accounted for the production of approximately 21% of its finished products, based on unit volume in Fiscal 2019. Nearly all of our Michael Kors products were produced in Asia in Fiscal 2019.
The manufacturing contractors and agents for our brands operate under the close supervision of our global manufacturing divisions and buying agents located in North America, Europe and Asia. All products are produced according to our specifications. Production staff monitors manufacturing at supplier facilities in order to correct problems prior to shipment of the final product. Quality assurance is focused on as early as possible in the production process, allowing merchandise to be received at the distribution facilities and shipped to customers with minimal interruption. See “Import Restrictions and Other Government Regulations” and Item 1A. —“Risk Factors” — “We primarily use foreign manufacturing contractors and independent third-party agents to source our finished goods, which poses legal, regulatory, political and economic risks to our business operations.”
Our future manufacturing and sourcing strategy includes creating a manufacturing center of excellence in Italy, as well as purchasing luxury manufacturing facilities in Italy to support all of our brands, to secure capacity and improve expertise in development and delivery. While the fashion design process will remain independently managed by each of our brands, we believe that creating a manufacturing center of excellence, which would combine all functions that support our design teams, from leather and hardware purchases to investment in machinery and systems, will create synergies and efficiencies for our global fashion luxury group.
Distribution
Versace owns a central warehouse in Novara, Italy, managed by a third party, which acts as a global hub for Versace’s primary operations. Versace also has a leased warehouse near Novara operated by the same third party, which serves as a distribution point for other Versace lines. From these warehouses, products are shipped to regional warehouses that are operated by third parties in New Jersey, Hong Kong, Beijing and Tokyo, and support the Versace retail business. E-commerce distribution is conducted through third party providers in Dorsten, Germany, Columbus, Ohio and Beijing, China. Versace’s wholesale business is mainly serviced from three central warehouses located in Italy, the United States and Japan.
Jimmy Choo uses a shared central warehouse facility in Contone, Switzerland, which acts as a global hub for all Jimmy Choo operations. From there, products are shipped to regional warehouses in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and United Arab Emirates, largely supporting the Jimmy Choo retail and e-commerce businesses. Shipments to wholesale customers globally are made from Switzerland and the United States, with some further local fulfillment. All of the distribution facilities utilized by Jimmy Choo are operated by third parties and are shared with other businesses. This flexible method reinforces the speed and efficiency of the supply chain and allows the business to deliver Jimmy Choo product and collections to market rapidly and in line with the industry’s fashion calendar.

Intellectual Property
We own VERSACE, JIMMY CHOO and MICHAEL KORS trademarks, as well as other material trademarks, design and patent rights related to the production, marketing and distribution of our products, both in the United States and in other countries in which our products are principally sold. We also have applications pending for a variety of related trademarks, designs and patents in various countries throughout the world. As our worldwide usage of our material trademarks, designs and patents continue to expand, we continue to strategically apply to register them in key countries where they are used. We expect that our material trademarks will remain in full force and effect for as long as we continue to use and renew them.
We aggressively police our intellectual property and pursue infringers both domestically and internationally. In addition, we pursue counterfeiters in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and elsewhere in the world in both online and offline channels, working with our network of customs authorities, law enforcement, legal representatives and brand specialists around the world as well as involvement with industry associations and anti-counterfeiting organizations.
Information Systems
Each of our three brands currently operates using their legacy systems for finance and accounting, supply chain, inventory control, point-of-sale transactions, store replenishment, and other functions. Our strategy includes consolidating certain systems across our brands over time to create operational efficiencies, as well as to achieve a common platform across the Company. During Fiscal 2020, the Company plans to begin a multi-year ERP implementation, which will conform the majority of its processes onto one global system that will support finance and accounting, procurement, inventory control, and store replenishment. The implementation of the ERP will require a significant investment in human and financial resources. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” - “A material delay or disruption in our information technology systems or e-commerce websites or our failure or inability to upgrade our information technology systems precisely and efficiently could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.” We also have several other systems supporting functions such as warehouse management, order management, supply chain management, point of sale and e-commerce.
Employees
At the end of Fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, we had approximately 17,797, 14,846 and 13,702 total employees, respectively. As of March 30, 2019, we had approximately 11,096 full-time employees and approximately 6,701 part-time employees. Approximately 14,319 of our employees were engaged in retail selling and administrative positions and our remaining employees were engaged in other aspects of our business as of March 30, 2019. As of March 30, 2019, we have 608 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements in certain European countries. We consider our relations with both our union and non-union employees to be good.
Competition
We face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate from both existing and new competitors. Our products compete with other branded products within their product category. In varying degrees, depending on the product category involved, we compete on the basis of style, price, customer service, quality, brand prestige and recognition, among other bases. In our wholesale business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers and distributors of products like ours for the limited space available for product display. Moreover, the general availability of manufacturing contractors allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of our competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business. We believe, however, that we have significant competitive advantages because of the recognition of our brands and the acceptance of our brands by consumers. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” — “The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, both within North America and internationally, and increased competition based on a number of factors could cause our profitability and/or gross margins to decline.”
Seasonality
We experience certain effects of seasonality with respect to our business. We generally experience greater sales during our third fiscal quarter, primarily driven by holiday season sales, and the lowest sales during our first fiscal quarter.

Import Restrictions and Other Governmental Regulations
Virtually all of our imported products are subject to duties which may impact the costs of such products. In addition, countries to which we ship our products may impose safeguard quotas to limit the quantity of products that may be imported. We rely on free trade agreements and other supply chain initiatives in order to maximize efficiencies relating to product importation. On May 10, 2019, the United States (“U.S.”) increased the tariff rate from 10% to 25% on $200 million of imports of select product categories from China. President Trump also announced the potential to expand these tariffs to cover all products entering the U.S. from Chin. If the U.S. follows through on its further proposed China tariffs, it would negatively effect our business. In addition, if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by other countries or by the U.S., the cost of our products could increase which could adversely affect our business. Additionally, we are subject to government regulations relating to both importation activities and product labeling, testing and safety. We maintain a global customs and product compliance organization to help manage our import and related regulatory activity.
