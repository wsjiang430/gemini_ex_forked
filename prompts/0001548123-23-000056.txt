History
 
Reflect Scientific, Inc., a Utah corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us” and words of similar import), was organized under the laws of the State of Utah on November 3, 1999, under the name “Cole, Inc.” On December 30, 2003, we acquired Reflect Scientific, Inc., a California corporation. We changed our name to “Reflect Scientific, Inc.” and succeeded to the business operations of our wholly-owned subsidiary, that involved the manufacture and distribution of unique laboratory consumables and disposables such as filtration and purification products, customized sample handling vials, electronic wiring assemblies, high temperature silicone, graphite and vespel/graphite sealing components for use by original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) in the chemical analysis industries, primarily in the field of gas/liquid chromatography. 
 
On November 29, 2005, we announced the execution of a Letter of Intent to acquire Cryomastor Corporation, a California corporation (“Cryomastor” [sometimes called “Cryometrix,” its amended name]).
 
Effective as of April 4, 2006, we entered into a Purchase Agreement (the “JMST Agreement”) with JM SciTech, LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Colorado, and doing business as JMST Systems (“JMST”); David Carver, an individual (“Carver”); and Julie Martin, an individual (“Martin”) (JMST, Carver and Martin are sometimes hereinafter referred to collectively as “Sellers”). Pursuant to the JMST Agreement, we purchased and JMST sold all right, title and interest in and to the JMST Technology (the “JMST Technology”), as described in the JMST Agreement; and Carver conveyed and assigned any rights he had in and to certain patents (the “Carver Patents”) and related intellectual assets as described in the JMST Agreement (collectively, including the Carver Patents, referred to herein as the “Carver Technology”). JMST had created a line of chemical detection instruments that are used in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and homeland security markets. The patented technology allows researchers to accurately analyze chemical formulations for their composition and identity. 
 
On June 27, 2006, we completed the acquisition of Cryomastor pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Cryomastor Merger Agreement”), which became our wholly-owned subsidiary; changed its name to “Cryometrix, Inc.”;

and succeeded to its business operations, which involved the manufacture and sale of ultra-low temperature freezer systems powered by liquid nitrogen for use in bio-repositories associated with the biotech and pharmaceutical industries, as well as government facilities, universities and many other diverse applications that require a large number of reliable and energy efficient freezers. 
 
Our Business
 
Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic
 
The recent COVID-19 Pandemic (“the Pandemic”) has to date had little negative effect on our business with regard to disruption of normal business activities such as receiving and processing orders and shipping. Many of the new COVID-19 vaccines and protein-based therapeutics require freezers either in processing or storing these products.  The press surrounding the COVID-19 vaccines has often focused on the dearth of freezers capable of storing vaccines at an appropriately low temperature. The Company sells ultra low temperature freezers and as a consequence benefited from the press-generated awareness of the need for these types of freezers. Our pharmaceutical freezer customers develop and manufacture many vaccines. The Company is not privy to the specific use of its low temperature freezers and can not determine if any increases in sales or revenue are directly attributable to the Pandemic. 
 
There is a continued risk of supply chain interruption, availability of raw materials or other unforeseen issues that can be caused by the ever-changing progression of the Pandemic. In addition, demand for the Company’s products may decrease or fluctuate in the future and current demand for our products may not, therefore, be indicative of sales and revenue going forward.
 
We recognize these risks and are taking every effort to prevent or mitigate them as they arise.
 
Overview
 
Reflect Scientific is engaged in the manufacture and distribution of innovative products targeted at the life science market. Our customers include hospitals, diagnostic laboratories, pharmaceutical and biotech companies, cold chain management, universities, government and private sector research facilities, chemical and industrial companies.
 
Our goal is to provide our customers with the best solution for their needs. This philosophy extends into our business strategies and acquisition plans. Through a series of strategic acquisitions, we acquired technology that has enabled us to expand our line of products to align with, and capitalize on, market needs. Our growing product portfolio includes ultra-low temperature freezers, blast freezers, solvent chillers and refrigerated transportation in addition to supplying OEM products to the life sciences industry.
 
Our Cryometrix brand ultra-low temperature and blast freezers innovative design enables our customers to save substantially on energy costs related to cryogenic storage. Ultra-low temperature freezers are used worldwide for the storage of vaccines, DNA, RNA, proteins and many other biological and chemical substances. There is a growing need for energy efficient, reliable ultra-low temperature storage units. Our Cryometrix freezers are targeted to this growing market and we have had tremendous success in blood storage and pharmaceutical manufacturing applications. The application of this technology for use in refrigerated trailers (commonly called “reefers”) used to transport goods which need to be maintained in a cold environment significantly broadens the market for this technology. The utilization of this technology in reefers eliminates the current method of cooling, which uses engines run on hydrocarbon fuels. The Cryometrix technology is pollutant free and is more efficient and cost effective than the technologies currently used. Reflect Scientific has added a new product line of solvent chillers. Solvent chillers are used in natural products extraction for optimizing product yield and purity.
 
Products
 
Reflect Scientific designs, develops and sells scientific equipment for the life sciences and manufacturing industries. Since Reflect Scientific’s inception in 1993, our focus is and has been on providing value added products, analytic testing supplies and equipment, and stand-alone products for the life sciences and industrial marketplace. Reflect Scientific’s products range from non-mechanical Cyrometrix™ freezers and value-added products and components for the life sciences industry to tools and analytical services for industrial manufacturing.

Our Cryometrix freezers use an entirely different technology for cooling that requires far less power and has significantly fewer moving parts. Less power consumption and fewer parts (i.e., less chance for wear or malfunction) translates into an immediate realization of cost savings to the customer. Management believes that there is no mechanical freezer that can match the temperature uniformity and rapid cooling of our Cryometrix freezer. These attributes are why these freezers are being sold into the pharmaceutical market – they meet customer needs that cannot be fulfilled by current freezer technology.
 
All of Reflect Scientific’s products and services are developed with one key factor in mind: Providing a superior cost/benefit to the customer verses other products in the same market space. With years of experience in the life science and industrial manufacturing markets, Reflect Scientific has been able to develop not only unique patentable products, but products that we believe offer a superior value proposition to the customer.
 
We have developed a business model with a focus on excellence in the design and development of products and solutions for life science and industrial manufacturing industries. We outsource the majority of our manufacturing, allowing us to concentrate our efforts on product innovation across multiple lines and industries. Our strength is in developing and providing value added products which we believe offer immediate and verifiable benefits and cost saving solutions. 
 
We have found a number of companies that can manufacture products to our specification, allowing us to focus on our core competencies of development and design, and maintain a flexible corporate structure capable of taking advantage of new opportunities without the large capital investment required to acquire tooling and manufacturing equipment. Our focus on development and design expertise, as opposed to manufacturing of products, enables us to innovate along multiple industry lines and customize our products to meet specific needs in a variety of industrial settings. Our products are sold in the biotechnology, natural products, pharmaceutical, cold chain management and medical industries, as well as manufacturing industries, such as automotive.
 
Cryometrix Freezers
 
Our Cryometrix ultra-low temperature and blast freezers are, we believe, a technological breakthrough that provides energy savings and other critically important benefits to cryo-storage customers in the life science related industries. Ultra-low temperature and blast freezers are used in many applications for the storage and fast freezing protocols of everything from blood to cancer vaccines. These types of freezers are used by hospitals and biotechnology research facilities. 
 
The only ultra-low temperature freezers currently available are produced by a limited number of companies and rely on a mechanical process for cooling. Because of inadequacies in the mechanical process, we believe there is loss of inventory each year because of the problems related to reliability inherent with mechanical freezers. 
 
Our freezers incorporate a disruptive technology. They are based on a complete divergence from the technology currently used in ultra-low temperature freezers. Through the advantages of our technology, we believe our freezers solve the current inadequacies and provide immediate cost savings and reliability for our clients. Current cryogenic storage equipment falls short of customer expectations in a variety of key performance criteria.
 
*     High energy usage – a growing problem with rising energy costs
 
* | Inflexible temperature range control– existing units cannot be easily modified for colder requirements (colder temperatures are an industry trend)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 *     Sample inventory is at risk in the event of a power failure
 
* | Poor temperature uniformity –samples in different areas of the freezer can experience wide variations in temperatures which is undesirable from a regulatory standpoint.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 *     Frost build-up
 
Our Cryometrix ultra low temperature and blast freezer uses a patented design and technology which is powered by liquid nitrogen. Through the use of a liquid nitrogen powered freezer system we are able to address the market need for:
 
*       Low energy requirements
  6

*       Flexible temperature control – wide range of usable temperatures
 *   Power failures have little effect - uses passive liquid nitrogen technology rather than electrically powered compressors.
 *       Uniform temperatures throughout freezer – more usable storage volume
 *       Much larger storage volume per area of floor space occupied – reduced facilities cost
 *       Reliable and essentially maintenance free, further lowering cost of ownership
 *       Environmental issues related to pollution using the current refrigerated trailer (“reefer”) technology
 
Cryometrix freezers are powered by liquid nitrogen. The competition’s freezers, including those developed by Thermo Fisher Scientific and Sanyo Corporation, are compressor based, with hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants and electric compressors. This basic technology difference results in the following Cryometrix advantages:
 

* | The Cryometrix freezer cooling medium is nitrogen, an all-green element that makes up 78% of our atmosphere. Many competitors use refrigerants that are harmful to the environment. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* | Cryometrix freezers cool extremely fast compared to the competition. One particular Cryometrix freezer will cool to -80C in eight minutes, an order of magnitude faster than the competition. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* | The inherent Cryometrix technology provides a much more uniform temperature throughout the freezer than competitors’ compressor-based freezers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* | When power is lost, the competitors’ freezers immediately fail to operate. Cryometrix freezers, when placed in manual freezing mode, continue to maintain a cold temperature for days and even weeks. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* | Cryometrix freezers are more reliable than the competition. Those well-versed in mean time between failure analysis calculate potential failures mainly based on the number of moving parts. Compressor-based freezers have many moving parts and are not as reliable in theory or in practice as Cryometrix freezers, which have almost no moving parts. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The adaptation of the freezer technology to reefers for transporting perishable items opens a significant new market. Trailers can easily be retrofitted with the Cryometrix unit, which operates pollution free, more efficiently, and provides a cost savings compared to the diesel-powered units currently used. The non-polluting Cryometrix unit provides significant benefits over any other unit currently marketed.
 
A new development using a similar liquid nitrogen cooling technology is the solvent chiller. Solvent chillers are used for providing chilled solvent for extracting a final commercial product from plant materials. The extraction solvent is rapidly chilled to a temperature that will optimize the extraction purity and recovery of the final product of interest. Solvent chillers are currently being sold into the CBD extraction market.
 
Other Products
 
In addition to our Cryometrix freezers, we market our Visacon OEM products, LCGCVials.com vial products, GCFerules.com OEM GC consumable products, and HPLC Detectors.com UV detector products into the chromatography market. These are highly technical products and encompass a vast array of sizes, configurations and uses. These products represent a stable supplies business but they do not represent a significant growth opportunity for the Company.
Competition
 
The environment for our products and services is intensely competitive. Although the complexity of the products we produce limits the number of companies we compete with, the companies with competing technology are generally larger and often subsidiaries or divisions of very large multinational companies. Our competitor’s size and association with large multinational companies gives them advantages over us in the ability to access potential customers. Many potential customers already purchase products either directly from our competitors or from another subsidiary of these large multinational companies, creating natural inroads to sales that we do not possess. 
 
Given our relative size versus our competitors, we are often required to seek niche markets for our products or focus on selling consumable components to be used by our competitors. We believe, however, that our technology and experience in the ultra-low freezers space allows us to be competitive in those markets. As our ultra-low freezer products are new to the marketplace, the products long term commercial acceptance is still unknown. Most of our products compete against

multiple competitors, with our refrigeration products competing primarily against Thermo Fisher Scientific and Sanyo Corporation. Although our Cryometrix freezer products are considered to be in the ultra-cold freezer market space, we do not believe that they compete directly with freezer products sold by these companies because our Cryometrix freezers use a completely different technology, liquid nitrogen cooling, to achieve very fast cooling rates and stable set temperatures. Freezer products sold by Thermo Fisher Scientific and Sanyo Corporation cannot achieve the same rates of cooling. Our Cryometrix freezers compete with other ultra-cold freezer products based on technical merit – their ability to meet freezing parameters ultra-cold freezer market space, we do not believe that they compete directly with freezer products sold by these companies because our Cryometrix freezers use a completely different technology, liquid nitrogen cooling, to achieve very fast cooling rates and stable set temperatures. Freezer products sold by Thermo Fisher Scientific and Sanyo Corporation cannot achieve the same rates of cooling. For additional disclosure about our Cryometrix products, see the discussion under the subheading “Cryometrix Freezers” above.
 
The product lines other than our Cryometrix freezers face competition from many laboratory supply companies, with Thermo Fisher Scientific being by far the largest. We estimate our market share in this segment to be well under five percent. However, because of the OEM nature of much of our chromatography business, we sell to several of the large chromatography supply companies.
 
Growth Plan
 
While we will continuously evaluate acquisitions of businesses and technologies to grow our revenues in the life science and green technology markets, our primary focus will be the continued growth of our own product lines through increasing market share and the addition of new innovative products to enhance our current offerings. 
 
We seek to expand the applications for our products and equipment into additional markets as we develop brand recognition. We hope to be able to obtain market leverage from our existing products and name recognition as we use our existing offerings and product strengths to position us as a key supplier of cryogenic storage, blast freezing and cold chain management solutions. This strategic plan will also enable us to further diversify our customer base.
 
Manufacturing, Supplies, and Quality Control
 
Many of our products are manufactured by strategic selection of third-party manufacturers. By outsourcing our manufacturing, we are able to reduce the overall cost position of our products. We manufacture our lower volume products that are less labor and parts intensive in our facility in Orem, Utah.
 
In addition, we engage in light manufacturing (assembly, filling and repackaging) for many of our chromatography supplies. We also do the final assembly and design for our Cryometrix brand freezers. The freezer shells, doors, shelving, heat exchangers and electronics are produced by contracted vendors. We sell directly to OEM customers and end users.
 
Regulation and Environmental Compliance
 
Presently, none of our products are in highly regulated industries.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Names of Principal Suppliers
 
Sources and availability of key materials and intermediates continue to remain stable. Where supply is considered a critical success factor for our business, we have certified primary vendors in place and have identified secondary vendors.
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
 
We have four major customers who represented 51 percent and 45 percent of our sales volume in 2022 and 2021, respectively. In our 2022 fiscal year, these customers represented 15 percent; 13 percent; 13 percent; and 11 percent of our revenues, respectively.

The Company has strong relationships with each of its customers and does not believe this concentration poses a significant risk due to those long-term relationships and the uniqueness of the products they purchase from us.
 
Our customers purchase our products via purchase orders describing the quantity and price of the products being purchased in a given transaction. By way of example, our largest customer purchases products through the use of more than 60 purchase orders per year.
 
Need for any Governmental Approval of Principal Products or Services
 
No products presently being manufactured or sold by us are subject to prior governmental approvals.
