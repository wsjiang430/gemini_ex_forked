GENERAL
 
Table Trac, Inc. (the “Company” or “Table Trac”) is a Nevada corporation, formed on June 27, 1995, with principal offices in Minnetonka, Minnesota. The Company’s corporate website address is www.TabletTrac.com.
 
The Company has developed and patented (U.S. patent # 5,957,776) a proprietary information and management system (called our “Table Trac” system) that automates and monitors the operations of casino table game operations. In addition to its table games management system, Table Trac has been adding functionality to related casino system modules for guest rewards and loyalty club, marketing analysis, guest service, promotions, administration / management, vault / cage management and audit / accounting tasks. Aggregated together, all of these modules have become the “Casino Trac” product, a full-featured Casino Management System (CMS) offering what we believe to be a powerful combination of value, efficiency and reliability for casinos seeking to add or upgrade their casino systems.
 
 The Company sells systems and technical support to casinos. The open architecture of the Table Trac system is designed to provide operators with a scalable and flexible system that can interconnect and operate with most third-party software or hardware. Key products and services forming a part of the Table Trac system include modules designed to drive player tracking programs and kiosk promotions, as well as vault and cage controls. The company’s systems meet the strictest auditing, accounting and regulatory requirements.

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
 
The gaming and lottery industries are generally subject to extensive and evolving regulation that customarily includes some form of licensing or regulatory screening of suppliers, manufacturers and distributors and their applicable affiliates, their major shareholders, officers, directors and key employees. In addition, certain of our gaming products and technologies must be certified or approved in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. Regulators review many facets of an applicant or holder of a license, including its financial stability, integrity and business experience. Any failure to receive a license or the loss of a license that we currently hold could have a material adverse effect on us or on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.
 
While we believe that we are in compliance with all material gaming and lottery laws and regulatory requirements applicable to us, we cannot assure that our activities or the activities of our customers will not become the subject of any regulatory or law enforcement proceeding or that any such proceeding would not have a material adverse impact on us or our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.
