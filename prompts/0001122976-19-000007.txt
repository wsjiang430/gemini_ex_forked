ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
We are a premier provider of specialized polymer materials, services and solutions with operations in specialty engineered materials, advanced composites, color and additive systems and polymer distribution. We are also a highly specialized developer and manufacturer of performance enhancing additives, liquid colorants and fluoropolymer and silicone colorants. Headquartered in Avon Lake, Ohio, we have employees at sales, manufacturing and distribution facilities in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our”, "PolyOne" and the “Company” mean PolyOne Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
PolyOne was formed on August 31, 2000 from the consolidation of The Geon Company (Geon) and M.A. Hanna Company (Hanna). Geon’s roots date back to 1927 when B.F.Goodrich scientist Waldo Semon produced the first usable vinyl polymer. In 1948, B.F.Goodrich created a vinyl plastic division that was subsequently spun off through a public offering in 1993, creating The Geon Company, a separate publicly-held company. Hanna was formed in 1885 as a privately-held company and became publicly-held in 1927. In the mid-1980s, Hanna began to divest its historic mining and shipping businesses to focus on polymers. Hanna purchased its first polymer company in 1986 and completed its 26th polymer company acquisition in 2000.
PolyOne Corporation is incorporated in Ohio and headquartered in Avon Lake, Ohio. We currently employ approximately 6,900 people and have 74 manufacturing sites and eight distribution facilities in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. We offer more than 35,000 polymer solutions to over 10,000 customers across the globe. In 2018, we had sales of $3.5 billion, approximately 43% of which were to customers outside the United States.
We are able to leverage our polymer and formulation expertise with our operational capabilities, creating an essential link between large chemical producers (our raw material suppliers) and designers, assemblers and processors of plastics (our customers). We believe that our role in the value chain continues to become more vital as our customers increasingly need reliable suppliers with global reach and increasingly effective material-based solutions to improve their products' appeal, performance, differentiation, profitability and competitive advantage. Our goal is to provide customers with specialized materials and solutions through our global footprint, broad market knowledge, technical expertise, product breadth, efficient manufacturing operations, a fully integrated information technology network and raw material procurement leverage. Our end markets include healthcare, transportation, packaging, consumer, building and construction, industrial, wire and cable, electrical and electronics and appliance.
Polymer Industry Overview
Polymers are a class of organic materials that are generally produced by converting natural gas or crude oil derivatives into monomers, such as ethylene, propylene, vinyl chloride and styrene. These monomers are then polymerized into chains called polymers, or plastic resin, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, in their most basic forms. Large petrochemical companies, including some in the petroleum industry, produce a majority of the monomers and base resins because they have direct access to the raw materials needed for production. Monomers make up the majority of the variable cost of manufacturing the base resin. As a result, the cost of a base resin tends to move in tandem with the industry market prices for monomers and the cost of raw materials and energy used during production. Resin selling prices can move in tandem with costs, but are largely driven by supply and demand.
Thermoplastic polymers make up a substantial majority of the resin market and are characterized by their ability to be reshaped repeatedly into new forms after heat and pressure are applied. Thermoplastics offer versatility and a wide range of applications. The major types of thermoplastics include polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyester and a range of specialized engineering resins. Each type of thermoplastic has unique qualities and characteristics that make it appropriate for use in a particular application. Thermoplastic composites include these base resins, but are combined with a structural filler such as glass, wood, carbon or polymer fibers to enhance strength, rigidity and structure. Further performance can be delivered through an engineered thermoplastic sheet or thick film, which may incorporate more than one resin formulation or composite in multiple layers to impart additional properties such as gas barrier, structural integrity and lightweighting.
Thermoplastics and polymer composites are found in a variety of end-use products and markets, including packaging, building and construction, wire and cable, transportation, medical, furniture and furnishings, durable goods, outdoor high performance equipment, electrical and electronics, adhesives, inks and coatings. Each type of thermoplastic resin has unique characteristics (such as flexibility, strength or durability) suitable for use in a particular end-use application. The packaging industry requires plastics that help keep food fresh and free of contamination while providing a variety of options for product display, and offering advantages in terms of weight and user-friendliness. In the building and construction industry, plastic provides an economical and energy efficient replacement for other traditional materials in piping applications, siding, flooring, insulation, windows and doors, as well as structural and interior or decorative

uses. In the wire and cable industry, thermoplastics and composites serve to protect by providing electrical insulation, flame resistance, durability, water resistance, water swelling and color coding to engineered fibers, yarn products, wire coatings and connectors. In the transportation industry, plastic has proven to be durable, lightweight and corrosion resistant while offering fuel savings, design flexibility and high performance, often replacing traditional materials such as metal and glass. In the medical industry, plastics are used for a vast array of devices and equipment, including blood and intravenous bags, medical tubing, catheters, lead replacement for radiation shielding, clamps and connectors to bed frames, curtains and sheeting, electronic enclosures and equipment housings. In the outdoor high performance industry, plastic applications are used for components and colorants for all terrain vehicles and reinforced polymers are used for various outdoor activities. In the electronics industry, plastic enclosures and connectors not only enhance safety through electrical insulation, but thermally and electrically conductive plastics provide heat transferring, cooling, antistatic, electrostatic discharge, and electromagnetic shielding performance for critical applications including integrated circuit chip packaging.
Various additives can be formulated with a base resin and further engineered into a structure to provide them with greater versatility and performance. Polymer formulations and structures have advantages over metals, wood, rubber, glass and other traditional materials, which have resulted in the replacement of these materials across a wide spectrum of applications that range from automobile parts to construction materials. These specialized polymers offer advantages compared to traditional materials that include design freedom, processability, weight reduction, chemical resistance, flame retardance and lower cost. Plastics are renowned for their durability, aesthetics, ease of handling and recyclability.
PolyOne Segments
We operate in four reportable segments: (1) Color, Additives and Inks; (2) Specialty Engineered Materials; (3) Performance Products and Solutions; and (4) Distribution.  Previously, PolyOne had five reportable segments. However, as a result of the divestiture of the Designed Structures & Solutions segment (DSS) on July 19, 2017, we have removed DSS as a separate operating segment and its results are presented as a discontinued operation. Historical information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect these changes. Please see Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Our segments are further detailed in Note 14, Segment Information, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Competition
The production of plastics and the manufacturing of custom and proprietary formulated color and additives systems for the plastics industry are highly competitive. Competition is based on service, performance, product innovation, product recognition, speed, delivery, quality and price. The relative importance of these factors varies among our products and services. We believe that we are the largest independent formulator of plastic materials and producer of custom and proprietary color and additive systems in the United States and Europe, with a growing presence in Asia and South America. Our competitors range from large international companies with broad product offerings to local independent custom producers whose focus is a specific market niche or product offering.
The distribution of polymer resin is also highly competitive. Speed, service, reputation, product line, brand recognition, delivery, quality and price are the principal factors affecting competition. We compete against other national independent resin distributors in North America, along with other regional distributors. Growth in the polymer distribution market is highly correlated with growth in the base polymer resins market. We believe that the strength of our company name and reputation, the broad range of product offerings from our suppliers and our speed and responsiveness, combined with the quality of products and agility of our distribution network, allow us to compete effectively.
Raw Materials
The primary raw materials used by our manufacturing operations are polyolefin and other thermoplastic resins, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin, plasticizers, inorganic and organic pigments, all of which we believe are in adequate supply. Oxy Vinyls LP sells PVC to PolyOne under terms of a Resin Purchase Agreement that expires on December 31, 2020. The agreement requires PolyOne to purchase a majority of its annual requirements in North America from Oxy Vinyls LP. This contract provides a year-by-year evergreen renewal provision, unless terminated by either party with a one-year advance notice. We believe this contract assures the availability of adequate amounts of PVC resin. We also believe that the pricing under this contract provides PVC resin to PolyOne at a competitive price. See the discussion of risks associated with raw material supply and costs in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”.

Patents and Trademarks
We own and maintain a number of patents and trademarks in the United States and other key countries that contribute to our competitiveness in the markets we serve because they protect our inventions and product names against infringement by others. Patents exist for 20 years from filing date, and trademarks have an indefinite life based upon continued use. While we view our patents and trademarks to be valuable because of the broad scope of our products and services and brand recognition we enjoy, we do not believe that the loss or expiration of any single patent or trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Nevertheless, we have management processes designed to rigorously protect our inventions and trademarks. 
Seasonality and Backlog
Sales of our products and services are seasonal as demand is generally slower in the first and fourth calendar quarters of the year. Because of the nature of our business, we do not believe that our backlog is a meaningful indicator of the level of our present or future business.
Working Capital Practices
Our products are generally manufactured with a short turnaround time, and the scheduling of manufacturing activities from customer orders generally includes enough lead time to assure delivery of an adequate supply of raw materials. We offer payment terms to our customers that are competitive. We generally allow our customers to return merchandise if pre-agreed quality standards or specifications are not met; however, we employ quality assurance practices that seek to minimize customer returns. Our customer returns are immaterial.
Significant Customers
No customer accounted for more than 3% of our consolidated revenues in 2018, and we do not believe we would suffer a material adverse effect to our consolidated financial statements if we were to lose any single customer. 
Research and Development
We have substantial technology and development capabilities. Our efforts are largely devoted to developing new product formulations to satisfy defined market needs, by providing quality technical services to evaluate alternative raw materials, assuring the continued success of our products for customer applications, providing technology to improve our products, processes and applications and providing support to our manufacturing plants for cost reduction, productivity and quality improvement programs. We operate research and development centers that support our commercial development activities and manufacturing operations. These facilities are equipped with state-of-the-art analytical, synthesis, polymer characterization and testing equipment, along with pilot plants and polymer manufacturing operations that simulate specific production processes that allow us to rapidly translate new technologies into new products. Our investment in product research and development was $56.3 million in 2018, $52.1 million in 2017 and $50.4 million in 2016. 
Methods of Distribution
We sell products primarily through direct sales personnel, distributors, including our Distribution segment, and commissioned sales agents. We primarily use truck carriers to transport our products to customers, although some customers pick up product at our manufacturing facilities or warehouses. We also ship some of our manufactured products to customers by rail.
Employees
In September 2018, the Great Place to Work Institute certified PolyOne as a Great Place to Work® in the U.S. based on a comparison of our employees' survey responses to those of employees at hundreds of other certified companies. We believe this reflects our commitment to better serving our associates, customers and communities, as well as further advancing our sustainability initiatives. 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 6,600 people. Approximately 2% of our employees are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements. We believe that relations with our employees are good, and we do not anticipate significant operating issues to occur as a result of current negotiations, or when we renegotiate collective bargaining agreements as they expire.

Environmental, Health and Safety
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that apply to the production, use and sale of chemicals, emissions into the air, discharges into waterways and other releases of materials into the environment and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste material. We endeavor to ensure the safe and lawful operation of our facilities in the manufacture and distribution of products, and we believe we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
We maintain a disciplined environmental and occupational safety and health compliance program and conduct periodic internal and external regulatory audits at our facilities to identify and correct potential environmental exposures, including compliance matters and operational risk reduction opportunities. This effort can result in process or operational modifications, the installation of pollution control devices or cleaning up grounds or facilities. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable requirements.
We are strongly committed to safety as evidenced by our record-low injury incidence rate of 0.51 per 100 full-time workers per year in 2018 and 0.69 in 2017. The 2017 average injury incidence rate for our NAICS Code (326 Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing) was 3.9. We hold the American Chemistry Council's certification as a Responsible Care Management System® (RCMS) company. Certification was granted based on PolyOne's conformance to the RCMS's comprehensive environmental health, safety and security requirements. The RCMS certification affirms the importance PolyOne places on having world-class environmental, health, safety and security performance.
In January 2019, PolyOne, along with 29 other member companies located throughout North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East, joined together as founding members of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW). The AEPW has thus far committed over $1.0 billion to help end plastic waste in the environment. The AEPW intends to develop and bring to scale solutions expected to minimize and manage plastic waste and promote solutions for used plastics by helping enable a circular economy. Our commitment to AEPW confirms the importance we place on being a global leader in all aspects of how we define sustainability: people, products, planet and performance.
In our operations, we must comply with product-related governmental law and regulations affecting the plastics industry generally and also with content-specific law, regulations and non-governmental standards. We believe that compliance with current governmental laws and regulations and with non-governmental content-specific standards will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The risk of additional costs and liabilities, however, is inherent in certain plant operations and certain products produced at these plants, as is the case with other companies in the plastics industry. Therefore, we may incur additional costs or liabilities in the future. Other developments, such as increasingly strict environmental, safety and health laws, regulations and related enforcement policies, including those under the Restrictions on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances (RoHS), Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (covering Conflict Minerals), and the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, the implementation of additional content-specific standards, discovery of unknown conditions, and claims for damages to property, persons or natural resources resulting from plant emissions or products, could also result in additional costs or liabilities.
We incurred environmental expenses, before insurance recoveries, of $23.2 million in 2018, $14.8 million in 2017 and $8.3 million in 2016. The increase in environmental expense is primarily due to arbitration related to potential recoveries of previously incurred costs from third parties and insurance carriers. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized gains associated with insurance recoveries of $4.3 million, $9.1 million and $6.1 million, respectively, as reimbursement of previously incurred environmental remediation costs. 
We also conduct investigations and remediation at certain of our active and inactive facilities and have assumed responsibility for the resulting environmental liabilities from operations at certain sites we, or our predecessors, formerly owned or operated. With respect to the former Goodrich Corporation Calvert City site, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) issued its Record of Decision (ROD) in September 2018, selecting a remedy consistent with our accrual assumptions. In October 2018, the USEPA sent a letter to the respondents inviting negotiation of an agreement to conduct the remedial design; that negotiation is ongoing. Our current reserve of $103.3 million is consistent with the USEPA's estimates contained in the ROD. Environmental reserves for all other sites totaled $10.8 million as of December 31, 2018, covering probable future environmental expenditures that we can reasonably estimate related to previously contaminated sites, other third-party liabilities, alleged contributions of contamination and contractual indemnification of other parties. This amount represents our best estimate of probable costs, based upon the information and technology currently available. We continue to pursue available insurance coverage related to all matters and recognize gains as we receive reimbursement. No receivable has been recognized for future recoveries.
Refer to Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Calvert City site and our overall environmental liability.
