ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1969, and its wholly owned subsidiaries own and operate a fleet of oceangoing vessels engaged in the transportation of crude oil and petroleum products in the U.S. Flag trades. The Company manages its fleet through two wholly owned subsidiaries. At December 31, 2018, the Company owned or operated a fleet of 21 vessels totaling an aggregate of approximately 900,000 deadweight tons (“dwt”). Additional information about the Company’s fleet, including its ownership profile, is set forth under “Fleet Operations— Fleet Summary,” as well as on the Company’s website, www.osg.com. Neither our website nor the information contained on that site, or connected to that site, is incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, except to the extent otherwise included herein.

OSG primarily charters its vessels to customers for voyages for specific periods of time at fixed daily amounts through time charters. The Company also charters its vessels for specific voyages at spot rates. Spot market rates are highly volatile, while time charter rates provide more predictable streams of time charter equivalent (“TCE”) revenues because they are fixed for specific periods of time. For a more detailed discussion on factors influencing spot and time charter markets, see “Fleet Operations—Commercial Management” below.
In August 2014, OSG emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy pursuant to a plan of reorganization approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. See Note 2 to our Financial Statements for further information regarding our bankruptcy proceedings.

Strategy

We seek to maximize stockholder value by generating strong cash flows through the combination of contracted time charter revenues and opportunistically trading vessels in the spot market; actively managing the size and composition of our fleet over the course of market cycles to increase investment returns and available capital; and entering into value-creating transactions, including acquisitions of competitive or adjacent businesses. The key elements of our strategy are to:

• | Generate strong cash flows by capitalizing on our leading Jones Act market position, complementary time charter and spot market exposures, and long-standing customer relationships;


• | Emphasize the quality of our operations and adhere to the highest safety standards attainable; and


• | Seek out opportunities to increase scale and drive cost efficiencies through a disciplined approach to investment in core and adjacent asset classes to maximize return on capital across market cycles.

We believe we are well-positioned to generate strong cash flows by identifying and taking advantage of attractive chartering opportunities in the U.S. market. We currently operate one of the largest tanker fleets in the U.S. Flag market, with a strong presence in all major U.S. coastwise trades. Our market position allows us to maintain long-standing relationships with many of the largest energy companies, which in some cases date back many decades. We consider attaining the stability of cash flow offered by medium-term charters to be a fundamental characteristic of the objectives of our chartering approach. However, considerations about the appropriate amount of capacity to remain active in the spot market are a regular management discussion point and balancing time charter coverage with spot market exposure in an uncertain demand environment is a persistent challenge. Over time, we will pursue an overall chartering strategy that seeks to cover the majority of available operating days with medium-term time charters. A policy of medium-term charters may not be profitable nor prove achievable under certain market conditions. As such, during periods of uncertainty in the markets within which we operate, more of our vessels will be exposed to the more volatile and less predictable spot market with a corresponding impact on the visibility and amount of revenue which our vessels may earn.

We believe that OSG has a good standing in the community of our customers, our peers and our regulators, with a long established reputation for a focus on maintaining the highest standards in both protecting the environment and maintaining the health and safety of all of our employees. We believe that continued improvement in these areas is important not only to the constituents directly affected, but equally as important in sustaining a key differentiating competitive factor amongst the customers whom we serve.

We plan to actively manage the size and composition of our fleet through opportunistic acquisitions and dispositions of vessel assets as part of our effort to achieve attractive returns on capital. Using our commercial, financial and operational expertise, we seek to opportunistically grow our fleet through the timely and selective acquisition of high-quality secondhand vessels or

new-build contracts when we believe those acquisitions will result in attractive returns on invested capital and increased cash flow. We also intend to engage in opportunistic dispositions or repurposing of our vessel assets where we can achieve attractive values relative to their anticipated future earnings from operations as we assess market cycles and requirements. Taken together, we believe these activities will help us to maintain a diverse, high-quality and modern fleet of crude oil, refined product, and potentially other U.S. Flag vessels with an enhanced return on invested capital. We believe our diverse and versatile fleet, our experience and our long-standing relationships with participants in the crude and refined product shipping industry, position us to identify and take advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities in any vessel class and in the U.S. Flag market.

Customers

OSG’s customers include major independent oil traders, refinery operators and U.S. and international government entities. The Company’s top two customers comprised 23% of shipping revenues during the year ended December 31, 2018. The customers and their related percentage of revenues are as follows: Shell (12%) and Petrobras America Inc. (11%). See Note 3 - “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Concentration of Credit Risk,” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 for further information regarding the Company’s customers for 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Commercial Management

Time-Charter Market

The Company’s operating fleet currently includes a number of vessels that operate on time charters. Within a contract period, time charters provide a predictable level of revenues without the fluctuations inherent in spot-market rates. Once a time charter expires, however, the ability to secure a new time charter may be uncertain and subject to market conditions at such time. Time charters constituted 58% of the Company's shipping revenues in 2018, 68% in 2017 and 80% in 2016 and 65% of the Company’s TCE revenues in 2018, 74% in 2017 and 83% in 2016.
Spot Market

Voyage charters constituted 42% of the Company's shipping revenues in 2018, 32% in 2017 and 20% in 2016 and 35% of the Company’s aggregate TCE revenues in 2018, 26% in 2017 and 17% in 2016. Accordingly, the Company’s shipping revenues are affected by prevailing spot rates for voyage charters in the markets in which the Company’s vessels operate. Spot market rates are highly volatile because they are determined by market forces including local and worldwide demand for the commodities carried (such as crude oil or petroleum products), volumes of trade, distances that the commodities must be transported, the amount of available tonnage both at the time such tonnage is required and over the period of projected use, and the levels of seaborne and shore-based inventories of crude oil and refined products. 

2 | Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.


Seasonal trends affect oil consumption and consequently vessel demand. While trends in consumption vary with seasons, peaks in demand quite often precede the seasonal consumption peaks as refiners and suppliers try to anticipate consumer demand. The timing of peaks in oil demand vary within the markets in which we operate. Available tonnage is affected over time, by the volume of newbuilding deliveries, the number of tankers used to store clean products and crude oil, and the removal (principally through scrapping or conversion) of existing vessels from service. Scrapping is affected by the level of freight rates, scrap prices, vetting standards established by charterers and terminals and by U.S. governmental regulations that establish maintenance standards. Voyage charters include COAs on four vessels. Changes in the percentage contributions are therefore affected by Delaware Bay lightering volumes. In addition, as ships come off of their time charters, they may be forced into short-term trades.

Business Segment

The Company has one reportable business segment. The Company’s U.S. Flag Fleet consists of 19 owned and chartered-in Jones Act Handysize Product Carriers and ATBs and two non-Jones Act U.S. Flag Handysize Product Carriers that participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program. Under the Jones Act, shipping between U.S. ports, including the movement of Alaskan crude oil to U.S. ports, is reserved for U.S. Flag vessels that satisfy Jones Act requirements, including requirements that vessels be constructed in the United States and owned by companies that are more than 75% owned and controlled by U.S. citizens. OSG is one of the largest commercial owners and operators of U.S. Flag vessels and participates in U.S. government programs, including the following:

• | Maritime Security Program—Two non-Jones Act U.S. Flag Product Carriers participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program, which ensures that militarily useful U.S. Flag vessels are available to the U.S. Department of Defense in the event of war or national emergency. Each of the vessel owning companies with a ship that participates in the program receives an annual subsidy that is intended to offset the increased cost incurred by such vessels from operating under the U.S. Flag. Such subsidy was $5,000 on one vessel and $4,600 on one vessel in 2018, $5,400 on one vessel and $4,500 on one vessel in 2017 and $3,500 on one vessel and $2,700 on one vessel in 2016.

Under the terms of the program, the Company expects to receive up to $5,000 annually for each vessel from 2019 through 2020, and up to $5,200 for each vessel beginning in 2021. The Company does not receive the subsidy with respect to any days for which one or both of the vessels operate under a time charter to a U.S. government agency, which was the case for one vessel during 2018.


• | Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation (“MarAd”) trading restrictions—Two of the modern U.S. Flag ATBs owned by the Company, which are currently used in the Delaware Bay Lightering activity, had their construction financed with the Capital Construction Fund (“CCF”). As such, daily liquidated damages are payable by the Company to MarAd if these vessels operate in contiguous coastwise trades, which is not permitted under trading restrictions currently imposed by the CCF agreement between MarAd and the Company. There were no liquidated damages incurred during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

The Company also has a 37.5% interest in Alaska Tanker Company, LLC (“ATC”), a joint venture that was formed in 1999 among OSG, Keystone Shipping Company and BP plc (“BP”) to support BP’s Alaskan crude oil transportation requirements. Each member in ATC is entitled to receive its respective share of any incentive charter hire payable by BP to ATC based on meeting certain predetermined performance standards. The Company’s share of the income earned by ATC is recorded in equity in income of affiliated companies and amounted to $3,500 in 2018, $3,800 in 2017 and $3,600 in 2016.

Ten of the Handysize product carriers in our U.S. Flag fleet are chartered-in. Those chartered-in vessels provide for the payment of profit share to the owners of the vessels calculated in accordance with the respective charter-in agreements on a 50/50 basis following the funding of certain reserves such as for drydocking and the payment to OSG of a daily management fee and a preferred profit layer. Due to reserve funding requirements, no profits have yet been paid to the owners or are, based on management's current forecast, expected to be paid to the owners in the current calendar year.

Technical Management

OSG’s fleet operations are managed in-house. In addition to regular maintenance and repair, crews onboard each vessel and shore side personnel must ensure that the Company’s fleet meets or exceeds regulatory standards established by the International Maritime Organization (“IMO”) and U.S. Coast Guard (“USCG”).

3 | Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.


The Company recruits, hires and trains the crews on its U.S. Flag vessels. The Company believes that its mandatory training and education requirements exceed the requirements of the USCG. The Company believes its ability to provide professional development for qualified U.S. Flag crew is necessary in a market where skilled labor shortages are expected to remain a challenge. The U.S. Flag fleet is supported by shore side staff that includes fleet managers, marine and technical superintendents, purchasing and marine insurance staff, crewing and training personnel and health, safety, quality and environmental (“SQE”) personnel.

Safety

The Company is committed to providing safe, reliable and environmentally sound transportation to its customers. Integral to meeting standards mandated by regulators and customers is the use of robust Safety Management Systems (“SMS”) by the Company. The SMS is a framework of processes and procedures that addresses a spectrum of operational risks associated with quality, environment, health and safety. The SMS is certified to the International Safety Management Code (“ISM Code,”) promulgated by the IMO. To support a culture of compliance and transparency, OSG has an open reporting system on all of its vessels, whereby seafarers can anonymously report possible violations of OSG’s policies and procedures. All open reports are investigated and appropriate actions are taken when necessary.
EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 1,061 employees comprised of 989 seagoing personnel and 72 shore side staff. The Company has collective bargaining agreements with three different U.S. maritime unions covering 812 seagoing personnel employed on the Company’s vessels. These agreements are in effect for periods ending between March 2021 and June 2022. Under the collective bargaining agreements, the Company is obligated to make contributions to pension and other welfare programs.
COMPETITION

OSG’s primary competitors are operators of U.S. Flag oceangoing barges and tankers, operators of rail transportation for crude oil and operators of refined product pipelines systems that transport refined petroleum products directly from U.S. refineries to markets in the United States. In addition, indirect competition comes from International Flag vessels transporting imported refined petroleum products.
ENVIRONMENTAL, SAFETY AND SECURITY MATTERS 
OSG’s vessels are registered in the United States and are subject to the jurisdictional oversight of the United States Coast Guard (“USCG”). In addition, the Company is also subject to compliance with several other government agency regulations including the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Maritime Administration of the United States Department of Transportation and the United States Customs and Boarder Protection. The Company vessels are classed with the American Bureau of Shipping (“ABS”) and are subject to the requirements of the classification society in addition to regulatory oversight on behalf of the USCG under various protocols and agreements covering certain statutory survey and certification functions for U.S. flagged vessels.
The majority of vessels owned and operated by OSG are engaged in U.S. coastwise trade with some vessels engaged in trade to and from countries outside of the United States. OSG's vessels operate in a highly regulated environment, subject to international conventions and international, national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the countries in which such vessels call upon, significantly affecting the operation of the Company's vessels. Among the more significant of the international conventions to which the United States is signatory are the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”), the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (“SOLAS”), and the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers.
Geopolitical reactions to industry related accidents have historically heightened the level of environmental, health, safety and security awareness among various stakeholders, including insurance underwriters, regulators, and charterers, leading to increased regulatory requirements and more stringent inspection regimes on all vessels. In recognition of this heightened awareness, the Company has set appropriate internal controls intended to monitor regulatory developments and to implement measures intended meet the higher expectations of our stakeholders. 
The Company is required to maintain operating standards for all its vessels emphasizing operational safety and quality, environmental stewardship, preventive planned maintenance, continuous training of its officers and crews and compliance with international and United States regulations, including regular and rigorous in-house inspections and audits. In addition, a variety of governmental and private entities subject the Company's vessels to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections. These entities include USCG, local port state control authorities (harbor master or equivalent), coastal states, Classification Societies and customers, particularly major oil companies and petroleum terminal operators. Certain of these entities require OSG to obtain permits, licenses and certificates for the operation of the Company's vessels. Failure to maintain necessary documents or approvals could require OSG to incur substantial costs or temporarily suspend operation of one or more of the Company's vessels.

OSG believes that the operation of its vessels complies with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, because such laws and regulations are changed frequently, and new laws and regulations impose new or increasingly stringent requirements, OSG cannot predict the cost of complying with requirements beyond those that are currently in force. The impact of future regulatory requirements on operations or the resale value or useful lives of its vessels may result in substantial additional costs in meeting new legal and regulatory requirements. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors-Compliance with complex laws, regulations, and, in particular, environmental laws or regulations, including those relating to the emission of greenhouse gases, may adversely affect OSG’s business.”
Regulations Preventing Pollution of Seas by Oil
The maritime industry is subject to numerous regulations and conventions intended to prevent pollution of the seas from ships. Regulated pollution sources include but are not limited to pollution from oil, hazardous substances, garbage, sewage, ballast water, antifouling paint and biofouling organisms.
MARPOL Annex I addresses requirements for the prevention of pollution by oil and oily materials generated in the engine room and from the cleaning of cargo tanks, while MARPOL Annex II addresses requirements for the prevention of pollution by noxious liquid substances (“NLSs”).
The United States regulates the shipping industry with an extensive regulatory and liability regime for environmental protection and cleanup of oil spills, consisting primarily of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA 90”) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). OPA 90 affects all owners and operators whose vessels trade with the United States or its territories or possessions, or whose vessels operate in the waters of the United States, which include the United States territorial sea and the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone around the United States. CERCLA applies to the discharge of hazardous substances (other than oil) whether on land or at sea. Both OPA 90 and CERCLA impact the Company's operations. OPA 90 amended the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require owners and operators of vessels to adopt Vessel Response Plans (“VRP”), including marine salvage and firefighting plans, for reporting and responding to vessel emergencies and oil spill scenarios up to a worst case scenario. The requirements also require OSG to identify and ensure, through contracts or other approved means, the availability of necessary private response resources to respond to a worst case discharge. The plans must include contractual commitments with clean-up response contractors and salvage and marine firefighters to ensure an immediate response to an oil spill or vessel emergency. OPA 90 also requires training programs and periodic drills for shore side staff and response personnel and for vessels and their crews. OSG maintains USCG approved VRP's for each of its tank vessels and non-tank vessels, which are valid until August 11, 2022.
IMO regulations require owners and operators of vessels to adopt Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans (“SOPEPs”) including periodic training and drills for response personnel and for vessels and their crews. In addition to SOPEPs, OSG has adopted Shipboard Marine Pollution Emergency Plans (“SMPEPs”), which cover potential releases not only of oil but of any NLSs. The Company's SOPEPs and SMPEPs were reapproved for five years in 2017 and remain valid until August 11, 2022.
US Liability Standards and Limits
Under OPA 90, vessel owners, operators and bareboat or demise charterers are responsible parties who are liable, without regard to fault, for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages, including property and natural resource damages and economic loss without physical damage to property, arising from oil spills and pollution from their vessels. Currently, the limits of OPA 90 liability with respect to (i) tank vessels with a qualifying double hull are the greater of $2,200 per gross ton or approximately $18.8 million per vessel that is over 3,000 gross tons; and (ii) non-tank vessels, the greater of $1,100 per gross ton or $0.9 million per vessel. 
The statute specifically permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes for oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries and some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for discharge of pollutants within their waters. In some cases, states that have enacted this type of legislation have not yet issued implementing regulations defining vessel owners' responsibilities under these laws. CERCLA, which applies to owners and operators of vessels, contains a similar liability regime and provides for cleanup, removal and natural resource damages associated with discharges of hazardous substances (other than oil). Liability under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5 million.
These limits of liability do not apply, however, when the incident is caused by violation of applicable U.S. federal safety, construction or operating regulations, or by the responsible party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Similarly, these limits do not apply if the responsible party fails or refuses to report the incident or to cooperate and assist in connection with the substance removal activities. OPA 90 and CERCLA each preserve the right to recover damages under existing law, including maritime tort law.

5 | Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.


OPA 90 requires owners and operators of vessels to establish and maintain with the USCG evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the limit of their potential strict liability consistent with the previous limits of liability described above under the statute. Under the regulations, evidence of financial responsibility may be demonstrated by insurance, surety bond, self-insurance, guaranty or an alternative method subject to approval by the director of the USCG National Pollution Funds Center. Under OPA 90 regulations, an owner or operator of more than one vessel is required to demonstrate evidence of financial responsibility for the entire fleet in an amount equal only to the financial responsibility requirement of the vessel having the greatest maximum strict liability under OPA 90 and CERCLA. 
OSG has provided the requisite guarantees and has received certificates of financial responsibility from the USCG for each of its vessels required to have one. OSG has insurance for each of its vessels, with pollution liability insurance in the amount of $1.0 billion, and deductibles ranging from $0.025 million to $0.1 million per vessel per incident. However, a catastrophic spill could exceed the insurance coverage available, in which event there could be a material adverse effect on the Company's business.
International Liability Standards and Limits
Compensation for oil pollution damage caused by spills from oil tankers is governed by an international regime developed under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization (“IMO”). The original International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969 (the “1969 Convention”) was amended in 1992 (the “1992 Protocol”) and entered into force on May 30, 1996. 
Many countries have ratified and follow the liability plan adopted by the IMO as set out in the 1969 Convention yet some of these countries have also adopted the 1992 Protocol. Under both the 1969 Convention and the 1992 Protocol, a vessel's registered owner is strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil, subject to certain complete defenses. These conventions also limit the liability of the shipowner under certain circumstances. 
The 1992 Protocol allows for states party to the 1992 Protocol to issue certificates to ships registered in states which are not party to the 1992 Protocol, so that a shipowner can obtain certificates to both the 1969 and 1992 CLC, even when the ship is registered in a country which has not yet ratified the 1992 Protocol. This is important because a ship which has only a 1969 CLC may find it difficult to trade in a country which has ratified the 1992 Protocol, since it establishes higher limits of liability.
These conventions calculate liability in terms of special drawing rights currency values. The figures in this section are therefore converted into U.S. dollars based on currency exchange rates on December 31, 2018 and are approximate. Under the 1969 Convention, except where the owner is guilty of actual fault, its liability is limited to $4.2 million for a ship not exceeding 5,000 units of tonnage (a unit of measurement for the total enclosed spaces within a vessel) and $587 per gross ton thereafter, with a maximum liability of $83.5 million. 
Under the 1992 Protocol, the owner's liability is limited except where the pollution damage results from its personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result. Under the 2000 amendments to the 1992 Protocol, which became effective on November 1, 2003, liability is limited to $6.3 million plus $882 for each additional gross ton over 5,000 for vessels of 5,000 to 140,000 gross tons, and $125.5 million for vessels over 140,000 gross tons, subject to the exceptions discussed above for the 1992 Protocol.
Vessels trading in states that are parties to these conventions must provide evidence of insurance covering the liability of the owner. The United States is not a party to the 1969 Convention or the 1992 Protocol. In other jurisdictions where the 1969 Convention has not been adopted, various legislative schemes or common law govern, and liability is imposed either on the basis of fault or in a manner similar to that convention. The Company believes that its protection and indemnity insurance will cover any liability under the plan adopted by the IMO.
The International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, 2001, which became effective on November 21, 2008, is a separate convention adopted to ensure that adequate, prompt and effective compensation is available to persons who suffer damage caused by spills of oil when used as fuel by vessels. The convention applies to damage caused to the territory, including the territorial sea, and in its exclusive economic zones, of states that are party to it. While the United States has not yet ratified this convention, vessels operating internationally would be subject to it, if sailing within the territories of those countries that have implemented its provisions. The Company believes that its vessels comply with these requirements.
Regulations Preventing Pollution of Seas by Sewage
MARPOL Annex IV (“Annex IV”) as well as the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations regulate the discharge of sewage to sea as the discharge of raw sewage into the sea can create a health hazard, can lead to oxygen depletion and can be an obvious visual pollution 

6 | Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.


in coastal areas. Annex IV also includes regulations regarding the ships' equipment and systems for the control of sewage discharge, the provision of port reception facilities for sewage and requirements for survey and certification. The most recent amendment to Annex IV, which came into effect January 1, 2013, introduced the Baltic Sea as the first special area. This amendment prohibits the discharge to sea from passenger ships, except when equipped with an approved treatment plant meeting specific nitrogen and phosphorous removal standards. 
Sewage discharge is also subject to national and local regulations which set forth further restrictions, in some cases prohibiting the discharge of treated sewage and the establishment of No Discharge Zones (“NDZs”). The most recent NDZ was introduced in Puget Sound in Washington State in 2018, prohibiting the discharge of treated or untreated sewage. OSG vessels are all equipped with Marine Sanitation Devices compliant with regulatory requirements for each type of vessel, has implemented controls to comply with various international, national and state regulatory requirements. The Company believes that its vessels comply with these requirements. If other NDZs are introduced or other new or more stringent requirements relating to sewage discharges by vessels are adopted by the states or countries where OSG operates, compliance may require the Company to incur substantial capital expenditures.
Regulations Preventing Pollution of Seas by Garbage
MARPOL Annex V, as well as, the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations regulates the prevention of pollution to sea by garbage. These regulations were further revised in 2017 to implement greater restrictions in the type of garbage able to be discharged to sea, added e-waste to the categories of garbage to be collected, stored, processed and disposed of, and required changes to the manner in which garbage is recorded. The Company has implemented all regulatory requirements and believes that its vessels comply with these requirements.
Regulations Preventing Air Pollution 
MARPOL Annex VI (“Annex VI”) addresses air pollution from vessels and sets limits on sulfur oxide (“SOx”) and nitrogen oxide (“NOx”) emissions from ship exhausts including prohibiting deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons. Annex VI also regulates shipboard incineration and the emission of volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) from tankers. Under Annex VI, vessels are subject to further air emission controls within Emission Control Areas (“ECA’s”). Currently designated ECAs are: the Baltic Sea, North Sea, North American and U.S. Caribbean. The North American Emission Control Area (“ECA”) encompasses the area extending 200 miles from the coastlines of the Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific coasts and the eight main Hawaiian Islands. The United States Caribbean Sea ECA encompasses water around Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
Fuel used by all vessels operating in or transiting through the ECA cannot exceed 0.1% m/m sulfur. More stringent NOx emission Tier III emission limits are applicable to engines installed on ships constructed on or after January 1, 2016 operating in ECAs. The Company believes that its vessels comply with the current requirements of MARPOL Annex V ECAs. If other ECAs are approved by the IMO or other new or more stringent requirements relating to emissions from marine diesel engines or port operations by vessels are adopted by the EPA or the states where OSG operates, compliance could require or affect the timing of fuel costs associated with operating in another ECA.
Commencing January 1, 2020, the global sulfur cap for ship operations will be reduced from 3.5% m/m to 0.5% m/m outside ECA’s as legislated by MARPOL Annex VI. In ECAs, the limit will remain at 0.1% m/m. Vessels currently using 3.5% m/m sulfur fuel outside ECA’s must completely consume their inventories prior to December 31, 2019 unless ships are installed with scrubbers to burn high-sulfur bunker fuel and comply with the 0.5% sulfur limit. 
In July 2011, the IMO further amended Annex VI to include energy efficiency standards for new ships through the designation of an Energy Efficiency Design Index (“EEDI”). The EEDI standards apply to new ships of 400 gross tons or above (except those with diesel-electric, turbine or hybrid propulsion systems). New ships for purposes of this standard are those for which the building contract was placed on or after January 1, 2013; or in the absence of a building contract, the keel of which is laid, or which is at a similar stage of construction, on or after July 1, 2013; or the delivery of which is on or after July 1, 2015. The EEDI standards phase in from 2013 to 2025 and are anticipated to result in significant reductions in fuel consumption, as well as, air and marine pollution. The composition of the Company’s fleet of vessels, as of December 31, 2018, does not include any vessels to which the EEDI standards apply.
The EPA has implemented rules comparable to those of Annex VI to increase the control of air pollutant emissions from certain large marine engines by requiring certain new marine-diesel engines installed on U.S. built ships to meet lower NOx standards. EPA Tier 2 standards were phased in beginning in 2004 and generally reduced NOx emissions by 27% and introduced a particulate matter limit (“PM”) for the first time. EPA Tier 3 standards were phased in beginning in 2009 and represented a 50% reduction 

7 | Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.


in PM and a 20% reduction in NOx over Tier 2 levels. EPA Tier 4 standards were phased in beginning in 2014 and represented a 90% reduction in PM and 80% reduction in NOx compared to Tier 2 levels and generally required advanced technology such as selective catalytic reduction or exhaust gas recirculation. Adoption of these and emerging standards may require substantial modifications to some of the Company’s existing marine diesel engines and may require the Company to incur substantial capital expenditures if the engines are replaced.
The U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 and 1990 (“CAA”), requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants. The CAA also requires states to draft State Implementation Plans (“SIPs”), designed to attain national health-based air quality standards in major metropolitan and industrial areas. Several SIPs regulate emissions resulting from tank vessel loading and degassing operations by requiring the installation of vapor control equipment. OSG's vessels are subject to vapor control and recovery requirements for certain cargoes when loading, unloading, ballasting, cleaning and conducting other operations in regulated port areas. All the Company's vessels are equipped with vapor control systems that satisfy these requirements. Although a risk exists that new regulations could require significant capital expenditures and otherwise increase its costs, the Company believes, based upon the regulations that have been proposed to date, no material capital expenditures beyond those currently contemplated and no material increase in costs are likely to be required as a result of the SIPs program.
The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environment Control (“DNREC”) monitors OSG’s U.S. Flag lightering activities within the Delaware River. Lightering activities in Delaware are subject to Title V of the Coastal Zone Act of 1972 and OSG is the only marine operator with a Title V permit to engage in lightering operations. These lightering activities are monitored and regulated through DNREC’s Title V air permitting process. The regulations are designed to reduce the amount of VOCs entering the atmosphere during a crude oil lightering operation through the use of vapor balancing. This defined process has reduced air emissions associated with venting of crude oil vapors to the atmosphere. In accordance with its Title V permit, OSG’s Delaware Lightering fleet is 100% vapor balance capable.
In February 2005, the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the “Kyoto Protocol”) became effective. Pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol, adopting countries are required to implement national programs to reduce emissions of certain gases, generally referred to as greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), which contribute to global warming. The United Nations Climate Change Conference forged a new international framework in December 2015 (the “Paris Agreement”) that is to take effect by 2020. The Paris Agreement sets a goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius and pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius, to be achieved by aiming to reach a global peaking of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions as soon as possible. To meet these objectives, the participating countries, acting individually or jointly, are to develop and implement successive nationally determined contributions. In 2016, the United States signed the Paris Agreement but, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department officially informed the United Nations of the United States' intent to withdraw. 
Though the Paris Agreement does not specifically mention shipping, the IMO is committed to developing limits on GHGs from international shipping and is working on proposed mandatory technical and operational measures to achieve these limits. The IMO’s third study of GHG emissions from the global shipping fleet which concluded in 2014 predicted that, in the absence of appropriate policies, greenhouse emissions from ships may increase by 50% to 250% by 2050 due to expected growth in international seaborne trade. 
In addition to Annex VI, there are regional mandates in ports and certain territorial waters within the European Union (“EU”) regarding reduced SOx emissions. In December 2012, an EU directive that aligned the EU requirements with Annex VI entered into force. These requirements establish maximum allowable limits for sulfur content on 0.1% m/m in fuel oils used by vessels when operating within certain areas and waters and while at berth in EU ports. 
In 2011, the European Commission established a working group on shipping to provide input to the European Commission in its work to develop and assess options for the inclusion of international maritime transport in the GHG reduction commitment of the EU. The EU Monitoring, Reporting, Verification Regulation (“MRV”) was adopted on April 29, 2015 and creates an EU-wide framework for the monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon dioxide emissions from maritime transport. The MRV requires large ships (over 5,000 gross tons) conducting cargo operations in EU ports commencing January 1, 2018, to collect and later publish verified annual data on carbon dioxide emissions. The Company believes that its vessels are in compliance with these regulations. 
In the United States., pursuant to an April 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision, the EPA was required to consider whether carbon dioxide should be considered a pollutant that endangers public health and welfare, and thus subject to regulation under the U.S. Clean Air Act. On December 1, 2009, the EPA issued an “endangerment finding” regarding GHGs under the Clean Air Act. In 2015, the EPA issued standards limiting carbon pollution from new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants and in 2016 found 

8 | Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.


that oil and gas sector sources of methane and GHGs from aircraft engines contribute to dangerous climate-changing air pollution. To date, the regulations proposed and enacted by the EPA have not involved ocean-going vessels.
In 2011, IMO’s Greenhouse Gas Work Group agreed on Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (“SEEMP”) development guidelines which entered into force on January 1, 2013. The primary objective of the SEEMP is to improve the overall operating efficiency of a ship through the implementation of optimized methods for energy and fuel savings. An energy efficiency certificate is issued for both new and existing ships of 400 gross tons or above and remains valid throughout its lifetime, until the ship is withdrawn from service, unless a new certificate is issued following a major conversion of the ship or until transfer of the ship to the flag of another state. In 2016, the IMO revised the SEEMP guidelines requiring vessels to implement a ship-specific fuel oil consumption data plan to collect, aggregate and report ship data with regard to annual fuel oil consumption, distance traveled, hours underway and other data required by regulation 22A of MARPOL Annex VI. This requirement takes effect on January 1, 2019 and is to be administered by the USCG for U.S. Flag vessels.
The Company believes that its vessels are compliant with the current requirements of Annex VI and the EPA. Additionally, the Company believes for its vessels that operate in the EU, they are compliant with the regional mandates applicable in the EU. Future passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO, EU, United States or other countries where OSG operates that restrict emissions of GHGs could require significant additional capital or operating expenditures and could have operational impacts on OSG’s business. Although OSG cannot predict such expenditures and impacts with certainty at this time, they may be material to OSG’s results of operations.
Ballast Water Pollution Regulations
OSG’s vessels are subject to international, national and local ballast water management regulations. At the international level, the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments (“BWM Convention”) was adopted by the IMO in 2004 and it entered into force on September 8, 2017. The BWM Convention is applicable to new and existing vessels that are designed to carry ballast water. It defines a discharge standard consisting of maximum allowable levels of critical invasive species designed to protect the marine environment from the introduction of non-native (alien) species as a result of the carrying of ships’ ballast water from one place to another. As tank vessels must take on ballast water in order to maintain their stability and draft and must discharge the ballast water when they load their next cargo, when emptying the ballast water which they carried from the previous port, they may release organisms and pathogens that have been identified as being potentially harmful in the new environment.
This standard will likely be met by installing treatment systems that render the invasive species non-viable. In addition, each vessel flying the flag of a signatory to the BWM Convention will be required to have on board a valid International Ballast Water Management Certificate, a Ballast Water Management Plan and a Ballast Water Record Book. 
The United States is not a signatory to the BWM Convention, and is not expected to be in the future, since it currently regulates ballast water management under two federal, partially overlapping regulatory schemes. One is administered by the USCG under the National Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990, as amended by the National Invasive Species Act of 1996, and the other is administered by the EPA under the U.S. Clean Water Act (“CWA”). Several U.S. states also have their own supplemental requirements, most notably California whose performance standard for organisms in ballast water discharges is significantly more stringent than any of the other regulatory regimes. Since the U.S. is not a signatory to the BWM Convention, U.S. Flag vessels cannot be issued a Ballast Water Management Certificate. Instead, the American Bureau of Shipping has been authorized to issue a Statement of Voluntary Compliance (“SOVC”) to any U.S. Flag vessel that has an approved Ballast Water Management Plan that contains the information required by the BWM Convention. A SOVC is expected to satisfy the requirements of Port State Control in countries that are a signatory to the BWM Convention, but it is not guaranteed to do so.
The discharge of ballast water and other substances incidental to the normal operation of vessels in U.S. ports as noted above is subject to CWA permitting requirements. In accordance with the EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”), the Company is subject to a Vessel General Permit (“VGP”), which addresses, among other matters, the discharge of ballast water and effluents including the submission of annual reports for each vessel OSG operates. The VGP, which was first issued in 2008 and subsequently reissued in 2013, identifies twenty-six vessel discharge streams and establishes numeric ballast water discharge limits that generally align with the performance standards implemented under USCG’s 2012 final rule and the IMO Convention. It also sets more stringent effluent limits for oil to sea interfaces and exhaust gas scrubber wastewater. The EPA’s phase-in schedule generally matches that of the USCG. The EPA determined that it will not issue extensions under the VGP, but in December 2013 it issued an Enforcement Response Policy (“ERP”) to address this industry-wide issue. In the ERP, the EPA states that vessels that have missed their compliance dates to meet the numeric discharge limits for ballast, but have received an extension from the USCG, are in compliance with all of the VGP’s requirements, other than the numeric discharge limits, and meet certain other requirements, will be considered a low enforcement priority. While OSG believes that any vessel that is or may 

9 | Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.


become subject to the VGP’s numeric discharge limits while in a USCG extension period will be entitled to such low priority treatment as per the ERP, no assurance can be given that they will do so. 
On December 4, 2018, the “Vessel Incidental Discharge Act” (“VIDA”) was signed into law and restructures the way EPA and the USCG are to regulate incidental discharges in the future, including prohibiting EPA and individual states from permitting these discharges under the NPDES permitting program. Instead, the discharges will be regulated under a new CWA Section 312(p) program: Uniform National Standards for Discharges Incidental to Normal Operation of Vessels. VIDA is expected to phase out provisions of the VGP and existing USCG regulations over a four-year period, replacing them with EPA-developed National Standards of Performance (“NSPs”) and USCG implementation, compliance and enforcement regulations for those NSPs.
In March 2012, the USCG promulgated its final rule on ballast water management for the control of nonindigenous species in U.S. waters. While generally in line with the performance standards set out in the BWM Convention, the final rule requires that treatment systems for domestic and foreign vessels operating in U.S. waters must be type approved by the USCG. The USCG first approved a treatment system in December 2016, and as of December 31, 2018, 14 more systems have been type approved, with additional systems under review. Under this rule, a treatment system is required to be installed (or equivalent method of management employed) by the vessel’s first regularly scheduled drydocking after January 1, 2016. The USCG issued over 14,000 extensions for vessels which generally delayed their compliance dates another five years, including nine OSG vessels. The USCG is unlikely to continue issuing extensions to vessels with original compliance dates in 2019 and later. Therefore, OSG expects to begin installing ballast water treatment systems on its vessels in late 2019 with the final installation in 2023.
OSG complies with these regulations through ballast water management plans implemented on each of the vessels it technically manages. To meet existing and anticipated ballast water treatment requirements, including those contained in the BWM Convention, OSG has a fleetwide action plan to comply with IMO, EPA, USCG and possibly more stringent U.S. state mandates as they are implemented and become effective, which may require the installation and use of costly control technologies. The Company anticipates that, in the next several years, compliance with the various conventions, laws and regulations relating to ballast water management that have already been adopted or that may be adopted in the future will require substantial additional capital or operating expenditures and could have operational impacts on the Company’s business.
Safety of Life at Sea
The SOLAS convention addresses the safety of merchant ships. Amendments to the SOLAS conventions come into force yearly and flag states are responsible for ensuring that ships under their flag comply with its requirements.
All of OSG’s vessels are currently flagged under the United States Coast Guard, who in coordination with the classification society, inspect vessels to ensure compliance with SOLAS requirements as well as requirements listed in the Code of Federal Regulations, as applicable. Control provisions also allow contracting governments to inspect ships of other contracting states if there are clear grounds for believing that the ship and its equipment do not substantially comply with the requirements of the SOLAS convention - this procedure is known as port state control. Various certificates are prescribed by the SOLAS convention as proof of compliance and issued to vessels by the U.S. Coast Guard and by the classification society on their behalf. The Company believes that its vessels comply with the current requirements of SOLAS, as applicable, to the type of vessel operated. 
Under the International Safety Management Code (“ISM Code”), promulgated by the IMO, vessel operators are required to develop a safety management system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy describing how the objectives of a functional safety management system will be met. The Company has a safety management system for its fleet, with instructions and procedures for the safe operation of its vessels, reporting accidents and non-conformities, internal audits and management reviews and responding to emergencies, as well as, defined levels of responsibility. The ISM Code requires the Company to have a Document of Compliance (“DoC”) for the vessels it operates and a Safety Management Certificate (“SMC”) for each vessel it operates. Once issued, these certificates are valid for a maximum of five years. The Company in turn must undergo an annual internal audit and an external verification audit to maintain the DoC. In accordance with the ISM Code, each vessel must also undergo an annual internal audit at intervals not to exceed 12 months and vessels must undergo an external verification audit twice in a five-year period.
The Company maintains a DoC which was reissued for five years on September 17, 2017 with requirements for annual audits by the USCG. The Company is also certified to the SQE requirements of the ABS Guide for Marine Health, Safety, Quality, Environmental and Energy Management, which also includes meeting the requirements of the International Standards of Organization in ISO9001:2015 (Quality Management) and ISO14001:2015 (Environmental Management) for the management of operation of oil tankers, chemical tankers and other cargo ships.

The SMC for each vessel is issued after verifying that the company responsible for operating the vessel and its shipboard management operate in accordance with the approved safety management system. No vessel can obtain a certificate unless its operator has been awarded a DoC issued by the administration of that vessel’s flag state or as otherwise permitted under SOLAS.
Noncompliance with the ISM Code and other IMO regulations may subject the shipowner or charterer to increased liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. For example, the USCG and EU authorities have indicated that vessels not in compliance with the ISM Code will be prohibited from trading to U.S. and EU ports.
Other EU Legislation and Regulations
The EU has adopted legislation that: (1) bans manifestly sub-standard vessels (defined as those over 15 years old that have been detained by port authorities at least twice in the course of the preceding 24 months) from European waters, creates an obligation for port states to inspect at least 25% of vessels using their ports annually and provides for increased surveillance of vessels posing a high risk to maritime safety or the marine environment, and (2) provides the EU with greater authority and control over Classification Societies, including the ability to seek to suspend or revoke the authority of negligent societies. 
OSG believes that none of its vessels meet the sub-standard vessel definitions contained in the EU legislation. EU directives require EU member states to introduce criminal sanctions for illicit ship-source discharges of polluting substances (e.g., from tank cleaning operations) which result in deterioration in the quality of water and has been committed with intent, recklessness or serious negligence. Certain member states of the EU, by virtue of their national legislation, already impose criminal sanctions for pollution events under certain circumstances. The Company cannot predict what additional legislation or regulations, if any, may be promulgated by the EU or any other country or authority, or how these might impact OSG.
Security Regulations and Practices
In 2002, the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”) came into effect and the USCG issued regulations in 2003 implementing certain portions of the MTSA by requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Similarly, in July 2004, amendments to SOLAS specifically dealing with maritime security came into effect, imposing various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities, most of which are contained in the International Ship and Port Facilities Security Code (the “ISPS Code”). Among other things, the ISPS Code requires the development of vessel security plans and compliance with flag state security certification requirements. To trade internationally, a vessel must attain an International Ship Security Certificate (“ISSC”) from a recognized security organization approved by the vessel's flag state. All of the Company's vessels have developed and implemented vessel security plans that have been approved by the USCG, have obtained an ISSC and comply with applicable security requirements.
The Company monitors the waters in which its vessels operate for pirate activity. Company vessels that transit areas where there is a high risk of pirate activity follow best management practices for reducing risk and preventing pirate attacks compliant with protocols established by the naval coalition protective forces operating in such areas.
In recent years, the maritime community has commenced addressing the vulnerability of ship operations to cyber security threats, both at sea and while in port. Exposure to these threats has become pervasive due to the increasing reliance on information and operating technology systems used in the management of ship operations. Because these systems control multiple aspects of ship operations, they become integral parts of system and operational safety. In 2014 IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) supported a Canadian and U.S. recommendation to develop voluntary guidelines on maritime cyber security practices. Since then, a wide variety of regulatory requirements and best practice guidance has been generated by industry stakeholders. In December 2016, the USCG published a cybersecurity policy letter regarding the criteria and process for the reporting of suspicious activity and breach of security and added cybersecurity to the list of security items covered by the MTSA. In June 2017, IMO adopted a resolution to encourage member governments to ensure that cyber risks are appropriately addressed in safety management systems no later than the first annual verification on the Company’s DoC after January 1, 2021.
OSG may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. Security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches (including the inability of our third-party vendors to prevent security breaches) could also cause existing clients to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation, cause losses to us or our clients, damage our brand and increase our costs.

INSPECTION BY CLASSIFICATION SOCIETIES 

Every oceangoing vessel must be “classed” by a Classification Society. The Classification Society certifies that the vessel is “in class” signifying that the vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the Classification Society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the vessel’s country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member. In addition, where surveys are required by international conventions and corresponding laws and ordinances of a flag state, the Classification Society will undertake them on application or by official order, acting on behalf of the authorities concerned. The Classification Society also undertakes on request, other surveys and checks that are required by regulations and requirements of the flag state. These surveys are subject to agreements made in each individual case and/or to the regulations of the country concerned.
Regular and extraordinary surveys of hull, machinery, including the electrical plant, and any special equipment classed are required to be performed for a vessel to maintain its class certification. For seagoing ships, annual surveys are conducted for the hull and the machinery, including the electrical plant and where applicable for special equipment classed, at intervals of 12 months from the date of commencement of the class period indicated in the certificate. Intermediate surveys are typically conducted two and one-half years after commissioning and upon each class renewal. Intermediate surveys may be carried out on the second or third annual survey.
Vessels are required to dry dock for inspection of the underwater hull at each intermediate survey and at each class renewal survey. For vessels less than 15 years old, Classification Societies permit in water inspections by divers in lieu of dry docking for intermediate surveys, subject to other requirements of such Classification Societies. Class renewal surveys, known as special surveys, are carried out for the ship’s hull, machinery, including the electrical plant, and for any special equipment classed, at the intervals indicated by the character of classification for the hull. 
At the special survey, the vessel is thoroughly examined, including audio-gauging to determine the thickness of the steel structures. Should the thickness be found to be less than class requirements, the Classification Society would prescribe steel renewals. Substantial amounts of money may have to be spent for steel renewals to pass a special survey if the vessel experiences excessive wear and tear. In lieu of the special survey every four or five years, depending on whether a grace period was granted, a shipowner has the option of arranging with the Classification Society for the vessel’s hull or machinery to be on a continuous survey cycle, in which every part of the vessel would be surveyed within a five-year cycle. Upon a shipowner’s request, the surveys required for class renewal may be split according to an agreed schedule to extend over the entire period of class survey period. This process is referred to as continuous class renewal. 
If defects are found during any survey, the Classification Society surveyor will issue a “recommendation” which must be rectified by the vessel owner within prescribed time limits.

Most insurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage that a vessel be certified as “in class” by a Classification Society that is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies (“IACS”). In December 2013, the IACS adopted new harmonized Common Structure Rules, which will apply to crude oil tankers and dry bulk carriers to be constructed on or after July 1, 2015. All the Company's vessels are currently, and the Company expects will be, certified as being “in class” by the American Bureau of Shipping, (“ABS”), a major classification society. All new and secondhand vessels that the Company acquires must be certified prior to their delivery under the Company's standard purchase contracts and memorandum of agreement. If the vessel is not certified on the date of closing, the Company has no obligation to take delivery of the vessel.

INSURANCE 

Consistent with the currently prevailing practice in the industry, the Company presently carries protection and indemnity (“P&I”) insurance coverage for pollution of $1.0 billion per occurrence on every vessel in its fleet. P&I insurance is currently provided by three mutual protection and indemnity associations (“P&I Associations”), all of whom are members of the International Group. The P&I Associations that comprise the International Group insure approximately 90% of the world's commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each association's liabilities. Each P&I Association has capped its exposure to each of its members at approximately $7.5 billion. As a member of a P&I Association that is a member of the International Group, the Company is subject to calls payable to the P&I Associations based on its claim record as well as the claim records of all other members of the individual Associations of which it is a member, and the members of the pool of P&I Associations comprising the International Group. As of December 31, 2018, the Company was a member of three P&I Associations. Each of the Company’s vessels is insured by one of these three Associations with deductibles ranging from $0.025 million to $0.1 million per vessel per incident. While the Company has historically been able to obtain pollution coverage at commercially reasonable rates, no assurances can be given that such insurance will continue to be available in the future.

The Company carries marine hull and machinery and war risk (including piracy) insurance, which includes the risk of actual or constructive total loss, for all of its vessels. The vessels are each covered up to at least their fair market value, with deductibles ranging from $0.1 million to $0.125 million per vessel per incident. The Company is self-insured for hull and machinery claims in amounts in excess of the individual vessel deductibles up to a maximum aggregate loss of $0.750 million per policy year.

TAXATION OF THE COMPANY

The following U.S. tax law applicable to the Company is based on the provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, existing and U.S. Treasury Department regulations, administrative rulings, pronouncements and judicial decisions, all as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. No assurance can be given that changes in or interpretation of existing laws will not occur or will not be retroactive or that anticipated future circumstances will in fact occur. 
U.S. Tonnage Tax Regime
The Company made an election to have the foreign operations of the Company’s U.S. Flag vessels taxed under a “tonnage tax” regime rather than the usual U.S. corporate income tax regime. As a result, the Company’s gross income for U.S. income tax purposes with respect to eligible U.S. Flag vessels does not include (1) income from qualifying shipping activities in U.S. foreign trade (i.e., transportation between the United States and foreign ports or between foreign ports), (2) income from cash, bank deposits and other temporary investments that are reasonably necessary to meet the working capital requirements of qualifying shipping activities, and (3) income from cash or other intangible assets accumulated pursuant to a plan to purchase qualifying shipping assets. The Company’s taxable income with respect to the operations of its eligible U.S. Flag vessels, of which there are two, is based on a “daily notional taxable income,” which is taxed at the highest U.S. corporate income tax rate. The daily notional taxable income from the operation of a qualifying vessel is 40 cents per 100 tons of the net tonnage of the vessel up to 25,000 net tons, and 20 cents per 100 tons of the net tonnage of the vessel in excess of 25,000 net tons. The taxable income of each qualifying vessel is the product of its daily notional taxable income and the number of days during the taxable year that the vessel operates in U.S. foreign trade.
