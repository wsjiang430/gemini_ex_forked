 Overall Business Strategies
 
  Our core business is and historically has been in the semiconductor industry (testing services, manufacturing-assembly) manufacturing and distribution. Revenue from the semiconductor industry accounted for 99.8% and 99.7% of our total revenue for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively. The semiconductor industry has experienced periods of rapid growth, but has also experienced downturns, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles of both semiconductor companies’ and their customers’ products and declines in general economic conditions. To reduce our risks associated with sole industry focus and customer concentration, the Company continues to put effort into expanding for new businesses in different industry. Real Estate segment contributed only 0.2% to the total revenue for fiscal 2019 and has been an insignificant business operation since the property market in China has slowed down due to control measures in China. We are continuing the process of winding-down our oil & gas equipment fabrication operations, which discontinued its operations in December 2012.
  
 To achieve our strategic plan for our semiconductor business, we believe that we must pursue and win new business in the following areas:
  
 ● Primary markets – Capturing additional market share within our primary markets by offering superior products and services to address the needs of our major customers.
  
 ● Growing markets – Expanding our geographic reach in areas of the world with significant growth potential.
  
 ● New markets – Developing new products and technologies that serve wholly new markets.
  
 ● Complementary strategic relationships – Through complementary acquisitions or similar arrangements, we believe we can expand our markets and strengthen our competitive position. As part of our growth strategy, the Company continues to selectively assess opportunities to develop strategic relationships, including acquisitions, investments and joint development projects with key partners and other businesses.

  Business Segments
 
  Testing Services
  
 Our testing services are rendered to manufacturers and purchasers of semiconductors and other entities who either lack testing capabilities or whose in-house screening facilities are insufficient for testing devices in order for them to make sure that these products meet certain commercial specifications. Customers outsource their test services either to accommodate fluctuations in output or to benefit from economies that can be offered by third party service providers.
  
 Our laboratories perform a variety of tests, including stabilization bake, thermal shock, temperature cycling, mechanical shock, constant acceleration, gross and fine leak tests, electrical testing, microprocessor equipment contract cleaning services, static and dynamic burn-in tests, reliability lab services and vibration testing. We also perform qualification testing, consisting of intense tests conducted on small samples of output from manufacturers who require qualification of their processes and devices.
  
 We use our own proprietary equipment for certain burn-in, centrifugal and leak tests, and commercially available equipment for various other environmental tests. We conduct the majority of our testing operations in Asia with facilities in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and China, which have been certified to the relevant ISO quality management standards.
  
  Manufacturing
  
 We manufacture both front-end and back-end semiconductor test equipment and related peripherals at our facilities in Singapore and the U.S.
  
  Front-End Products
  
  Artic Temperature Controlled Wafer Chucks
  
 Artic Temperature Controlled Wafer Chucks are used for test, characterization and failure analysis of semiconductor wafers and such other components at accurately controlled cold and hot temperatures. These systems provide excellent performance to meet the most demanding customer applications. Several unique mechanical design features provide excellent mechanical stability under high probing forces and across temperature ranges.
 Wet Process Stations
  
 Wet Process Stations are used for cleaning, rinsing and drying semiconductor wafers, flat panel display magnetic disks, and other microelectronic substrates. After the etching or deposition of integrated circuits, wafers are typically sent through a series of 100 to 300 additional processing steps. At many of these processing steps, the wafer is washed and dried using Wet Process Stations.
  
  Back-End Products
 
 
  Autoclaves and HAST (Highly Accelerated Stress Test) Equipment
  
 We manufacture autoclaves, HAST systems and specialized test fixtures. Autoclaves provide pressurized, saturated vapor (100% relative humidity) test environments for fast and easy monitoring of integrated circuit manufacturing processes. HAST systems provide a fast and cost-effective alternative to conventional non-pressurized temperature and humidity testing.

  Burn-in Equipment and Boards
  
 We manufacture burn-in systems, burn-in boards and burn-in board test systems. Burn-in equipment is used to subject semiconductor devices to elevated temperatures while testing them electrically to identify early product failures and to assure long-term reliability. Burn-in boards are used to mount devices during high temperature environmental stressing tests.
  
 We provide integrated burn-in automation solutions to improve products’ yield, reduce processing downtime and improve efficiency. In addition, we develop a cooling solution, which is used to cool or maintain the temperature of high power heat dissipation semiconductor devices.
  
  Component Centrifuges and Leak Detection Equipment
  
 We manufacture centrifuges that perform high speed constant acceleration to test the mechanical integrity of ceramic and other hermetically sealed semiconductor devices and electronic parts for high reliability and aerospace applications. Leak detection equipment is designed to detect leaks in hermetic packaging. The bubble tester is used for gross leak detection. A visual bubble trail will indicate when a device is defective.
 Distribution
  
 In addition to marketing our proprietary products, we distribute complementary products made by manufacturers mainly from the U.S., Europe, Taiwan and Japan. The products include environmental chambers, handlers, interface systems, vibration systems, shaker systems, solderability testers and other, semiconductor equipment. Besides equipment, we also distribute a wide range of components such as connectors, sockets, LCD display panels and touch-screen panels. Furthermore, our range of products are mainly targeted for industrial products, the life cycle of which can last from 3 years to 7 years, rather than consumer products which have a shorter life cycle.
 Real Estate
  
  Beginning in 2007, TTI invested in real estate property in Chongqing, China, which has generated investment income from the rental revenue and investment returns from deemed loan receivables, which are classified as other income. The rental income is generated from the rental properties in MaoYe and FuLi in Chongqing, China. In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the investment in JiaSheng, which was deemed as loans receivable, was transferred to down payment for purchase of investment property in China. 
 Product Research and Development
  
 We focus our research and development activities on improving and enhancing both product design and process technology. We conduct product and system research and development activities for our products in Singapore and the U.S. Research and development expenses were $345 and $451 in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 Marketing, Distribution and Services
  
 We market our products and services worldwide, directly and through independent sales representatives and our own marketing sales team. We have approximately five independent sales representatives operating in the U.S. and another twenty in various foreign countries. All sales representatives represented the testing services segment and the manufacturing segment for various products and services produced and provided from our facilities in different locations.
 Dependence on Limited Number of Customers
  
 In fiscal years 2019 and 2018, combined sales of equipment and services to our three largest customers accounted for approximately 58.3% and 64.0%, respectively, of our total net revenue. Of those sales, $16,421 (41.9%) and $21,648 (51.4%), of our total net revenue were from one major customer. Although the major customer is a U.S. company, the revenue generated from it was from facilities located outside of the U.S. The majority of our sales and services in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 were to customers outside of the U.S.

  Backlog
 
 The following table sets forth the Company's backlog at the dates indicated:
  
 
 | For the Year Ended June 30,
-------------------------+----------------------------
 | 2019 | 2018 
Manufacturing backlog | $4,210 | $4,324 
Testing services backlog | 4,292 | 4,927 
Distribution backlog | 1,494 | 2,781 
Real estate backlog* | 153 | 293 
 | $10,149 | $12,325


 
 *Real estate backlog is based on the rental income from a non-cancellable lease.
  
 Based on our past experience, we do not anticipate any significant cancellations or re-negotiation of sales. The purchase orders for the manufacturing, testing services and distribution businesses generally require delivery within 12 months from the date of the purchase order and certain costs are incurred before delivery. In the event of a cancellation of a confirmed purchase order, we require our customers to reimburse us for all costs incurred. We do not anticipate any difficulties in meeting delivery schedules. For testing services, the backlog is based on estimates provided by our customers and is not based on a customer’s purchase order as it is a practice that the purchase orders are provided only during the process of delivery. During the fiscal year 2019, management has revised the basis of estimation to be more reflective of realizable revenue, and thus the prior year amount has been restated for comparison purpose.
  
  Materials and Supplies
  
 Our products are designed by our engineers and are assembled and tested at our facilities in the U.S., China and Singapore. We purchase all parts and certain components from outside vendors for assembly purposes. We have no written contracts with any of our key suppliers. As these parts and components are available from a variety of sources, we believe that the loss of any one of our suppliers would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations taken as a whole.
 Competition
  
 Our ability to compete depends on our ability to develop, introduce and sell new products or enhanced versions of existing products on a timely basis and at competitive prices, while reducing our costs.
  
 There are numerous testing laboratories in the areas where we operate that perform a range of testing services similar to those offered. However, due to severe competition in the Asia testing and burn-in services industry there has been a reduction in the total number of competitors. The existence of competing laboratories and the purchase of testing equipment by semiconductor manufacturers and users are potential threats to our future testing services revenue and earnings. Although these laboratories and new competitors may challenge us at any time, we believe that other factors, including reputation, long service history and strong customer relationships, are instrumental in determining our position in the market.
  
 The distribution segment sells a wide range of equipment to be used for testing products. As the semiconductor equipment industry is highly competitive, we offer a one-stop service alternative to customers by complementing our products with design consultancy and other value-added services.
  
 The principal competitive factors in the manufacturing industry include product performance, reliability, service and technical support, product improvements, price, established relationships with customers and product familiarity. We make every effort to compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. Although we have competitors for our various products, we believe that our products compete favorably with respect to each of the above factors. We have been in business for more than 60 years and have operation facilities mostly located in Asia. Those factors combined have helped us to establish and nurture long-term relationships with customers and will allow us to continue doing business with our existing customers upon their relocation to other regions where we have a local presence or are able to reach.

 Patents
  
 In fiscal years 2019 and 2018, we did not register any patents within the U.S.
  
 It is typical in the semiconductor industry to receive notices from time to time alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of others. We do not believe that we infringe on the intellectual property rights of any others. However, should any claims be brought against us, the cost of litigating such claims and any damages could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Employees
  
 As of June 30, 2019, we had approximately 574 full time employees and no part time employees. Geographically, approximately 9 full time employees were located in the U.S. and approximately 565 full time employees in Asia. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
  
 There were approximately 59 employees in the manufacturing segment, 479 employees in the testing services segment, 3 employees in the distribution segment, 3 employees in the real estate segment and 30 employees in general administration, logistics and others.
