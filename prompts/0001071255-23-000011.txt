ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Corporate Information
We were incorporated in Minnesota in 1998 under the name of GCI Lakes, Inc., which name was subsequently changed to Lakes Gaming, Inc. in August 1998, to Lakes Entertainment, Inc. in June 2002 and to Golden Entertainment, Inc. in July 2015. Our shares began trading publicly in January 1999. The mailing address of our headquarters is 6595 S. Jones Boulevard, Las Vegas, Nevada 89118, and our telephone number at that location is (702) 893-7777.
Overview
We own and operate a diversified entertainment platform, consisting of a portfolio of gaming assets that focus on casino and distributed gaming operations (including gaming in our branded taverns). Our portfolio includes ten casino properties located in Nevada and Maryland. Our distributed gaming operations involve the installation, maintenance and operation of slot machines and amusement devices in non-casino locations such as restaurants, bars, taverns, convenience stores, liquor stores and grocery stores in Nevada and Montana. We also operate branded taverns targeting local patrons located primarily in the greater Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area.
Rocky Gap Sale
On August 24, 2022, we entered into definitive agreements to sell Rocky Gap Casino Resort (“Rocky Gap”) to Century Casinos, Inc. (“Century”) and VICI Properties, L.P. (“VICI”), an affiliate of VICI Properties Inc., for aggregate consideration 
of $260.0 million (the “Rocky Gap Transactions”). Specifically, Century agreed to acquire the operations of Rocky Gap from us for $56.1 million in cash (subject to adjustment based on Rocky Gap’s working capital and cage cash at closing), subject to the conditions and terms set forth therein, and VICI agreed to acquire the real estate assets relating to Rocky Gap from us for $203.9 million in cash, subject to the conditions and terms set forth therein. The Rocky Gap Transactions are required by their terms to close concurrently and we expect the Rocky Gap Transactions to close during the second quarter of 2023, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions.
Impact of COVID-19
As of December 31, 2022, all of our properties were open other than the Colorado Belle (whose operations remain suspended), and none of our casino properties or distributed gaming locations were subject to COVID-19 operating restrictions. Despite the resurgence of Omicron variants during 2022, our casino properties and distributed gaming operations experienced positive trends during the first half of 2022, including an increase in occupancy of hotel rooms and guest visitation following the removal of COVID-19 mitigation measures. Our results of operations in the second half of 2021 also benefited from pent-up demand following the easing of COVID-19 mitigation measures and the effect of government stimulus on discretionary consumer spending. Future COVID-19 variants, mandates, restrictions or mitigation measures imposed by governmental authorities or regulatory bodies are uncertain and could have a significant impact on our future operations.
Operations
We conduct our business through five reportable segments: Nevada Casino Resorts, Nevada Locals Casinos, Maryland Casino Resort, Nevada Taverns and Distributed Gaming. 
The following table sets forth certain information regarding our operations by reportable segment as of December 31, 2022 (certain amenities at our casino properties may remain closed or operate in a limited capacity as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic):

(1) The operations of the Colorado Belle remain suspended. 
Nevada Casino Resorts
Our Nevada Casino Resorts segment is comprised of destination casino resort properties offering a variety of food and beverage outlets, entertainment venues and other amenities. The casino resort properties in this segment cater primarily to a regional drive-in customer base seeking a value-oriented vacation experience, with guests typically traveling from Southern California or Arizona. Our casino resort properties in Nevada have a significantly larger number of hotel rooms compared to the other casino properties in our portfolio. While hotel stays at these casino resorts are typically longer, the overall frequency of visitation from guests is lower when compared to our Nevada Locals Casinos. 
The STRAT: The STRAT is our premier casino resort property, located on Las Vegas Boulevard on the north end of the Las Vegas Strip. The STRAT comprises a casino, a hotel and the iconic SkyPod, which includes indoor and outdoor observation decks, thrill rides and the SkyJump attraction. In addition to hotel rooms, gaming and sportsbook facilities in an 80,000 square foot casino, The STRAT offers ten restaurants, two rooftop pools, a fitness center, retail shops and entertainment facilities.
Laughlin casinos: We own and operate three casino resorts in Laughlin, Nevada, which is located approximately 90 miles from Las Vegas on the western bank of the Colorado River. In addition to hotel rooms, gaming and sportsbook facilities, the Aquarius has nine restaurants and the Edgewater offers six restaurants. The Edgewater also offers dedicated entertainment 
venues, including the Edge Pavilion and the Laughlin Event Center. As noted above, the operations of the Colorado Belle remain suspended.
Nevada Locals Casinos
Our Nevada Locals Casinos segment is comprised of casino properties that cater to local customers who generally live within a five-mile radius. Our locals casino properties typically experience a higher frequency of customer visits compared to our casino resort properties in Nevada and Maryland, with many of our customers visiting our Nevada Locals Casinos on a weekly basis. The casino properties within this reportable segment have no or a limited number of hotel rooms and offer fewer food and beverage outlets or other amenities, with revenues primarily generated from slot machine play. 
Arizona Charlie’s casinos: Our Arizona Charlie’s Boulder and Arizona Charlie’s Decatur casino properties primarily serve local Las Vegas gaming patrons, and provide an alternative experience to the Las Vegas Strip. In addition to hotel rooms, gaming, sportsbook and bingo facilities, Arizona Charlie’s Boulder offers five restaurants and an RV park with 221 RV hook-up sites and Arizona Charlie’s Decatur offers five restaurants.
Pahrump casinos: We own and operate three casino properties in Pahrump, Nevada, which is located approximately 60 miles from Las Vegas and is a gateway to Death Valley National Park. In addition to gaming, sportsbook and bingo facilities at our Pahrump casino properties, Pahrump Nugget offers hotel rooms, a bowling center and a 5,200 square foot banquet and event center, and Lakeside Casino & RV Park offers 159 RV hook-up sites.
Maryland Casino Resort
Our Maryland Casino Resort segment is comprised of our AAA Four Diamond Award® winning Rocky Gap casino resort, which is geographically disparate from our Nevada properties, operates in a separate regulatory jurisdiction and has only a limited number of hotel rooms compared to our Nevada Casino Resorts. Rocky Gap caters to a regional drive-in customer base traveling from mid-Atlantic areas (i.e., Maryland, Virginia, Washington DC, Pennsylvania and West Virginia). Rocky Gap is situated on approximately 270 acres in the Rocky Gap State Park in Maryland, which we lease from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (the “Maryland DNR”) under a 40-year ground lease expiring in 2052 (plus a 20-year renewal option). In addition to hotel rooms and gaming, Rocky Gap offers a full range of amenities, including various food and beverage outlets, a Jack Nicklaus signature golf course, spa and pool and an event and conference center. 
On August 24, 2022, we entered into definitive agreements to sell Rocky Gap for aggregate consideration of $260.0 million. The Rocky Gap Transactions are required by their terms to close concurrently and we expect the Rocky Gap Transactions to close during the second quarter of 2023, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions.
Nevada Taverns
Our Nevada Taverns segment is comprised of branded tavern locations, where we control the food and beverage operations as well as the slot machines located within the tavern. Our branded taverns offer a casual, upscale environment catering to local patrons offering superior food, craft beer and other alcoholic beverages, and are typically limited to 15 slot machines. Most of our branded taverns are located in the greater Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area and cater to local patrons seeking more convenient entertainment establishments than traditional casino properties. Our tavern patrons are typically younger than traditional casino customers, which diversifies our customer demographic. Our tavern brands include PT’s Pub, PT’s Gold, PT’s Ranch, Sean Patrick’s, Sierra Gold and SG Bar. As of December 31, 2022, we owned and operated 64 branded taverns, which offered a total of over 1,000 onsite slot machines. We continue to look for opportunities to pursue additional tavern openings and acquisitions.
Distributed Gaming
Our Distributed Gaming segment is comprised of the operation of slot machines and amusement devices in over 1,000 third-party non-casino locations, such as restaurants, bars, taverns, convenience stores, liquor stores and grocery stores, across Nevada and Montana, with a limited number of slot machines in each location. We own and operate over 10,600 slot machines and amusement devices as part of our Distributed Gaming segment, with the majority of gaming devices offered at these locations being video poker machines. Distributed Gaming operations cater to local residents with high frequency visitation to these locations. We place our slot machines and amusement devices in locations where we believe they will receive maximum customer traffic. 
In August 2017, we became licensed as a video gaming terminal operator in Illinois. In October 2022, we surrendered our video gaming terminal operator license in Illinois due to inactivity. In October 2018, we received a conditional license to operate in 
Pennsylvania, providing for potential expansion.
Nevada law limits distributed gaming operations (also known as “restricted gaming” operations) to certain types of non-casino locations, including grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, restaurants, bars, taverns and liquor stores, where gaming is incidental to the primary business being conducted at the location and games are generally limited to 15 or fewer slot machines and no other forms of gaming activity. The gaming area in these business locations is typically small, and in many instances, segregated from the primary business area, including the use of alcoves in grocery stores and drug stores and installation of slot machines into the physical bar (also known as “bar top” slot machines) in bars and taverns. Such segregation provides greater oversight and supervision of the slot machines. Under Montana law, distributed gaming operations are limited to business locations licensed to sell alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption only, with such locations generally restricted to offering a maximum of 20 slot machines.
In Nevada, we generally enter into two types of slot placement contracts as part of our distributed gaming business: space lease agreements and participation agreements. Under space lease agreements, we pay a fixed monthly rental fee for the right to install, maintain and operate our slot machines at a business location and we are the sole holder of the applicable gaming license that allows us to operate such slot machines. Under participation agreements, the business location retains a percentage of the gaming revenue generated from our slot machines, and as a result both the business location and Golden are required to hold a state-issued gaming license. In Montana, our slot and amusement device placement contracts are all participation agreements.
Sales and Marketing
We market our Nevada Casino Resorts through both local and regional advertising, with a focus on offering a more complete resort destination experience that may include rooms, entertainment, dining and attractions. We advertise through various media channels, including television, radio, outdoor, digital, social media and public relations.
Marketing for our Nevada Locals Casinos targets the local communities in which these properties operate with an emphasis on the gaming experience, casino promotions and dining. The advertising is geared towards a local audience and typically includes radio, outdoor, digital and social media with television used occasionally for promotional messaging and brand campaigns when appropriate.
Rocky Gap is located in western Maryland in close proximity to the affluent and heavily populated metropolitan areas of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Baltimore, Maryland and Washington, D.C., as well as two major interstate freeways. Rocky Gap serves as a premier destination for both local and out-of-market patrons. Our marketing efforts for Rocky Gap are primarily focused on attracting patrons through local and regional campaigns promoting both the amenities of Rocky Gap and the vast array of outdoor activities available in the Rocky Gap State Park.
The customer base of our Nevada Taverns and Distributed Gaming segments is primarily comprised of local patrons who frequent our branded taverns and use our slot machines and amusement devices in contracted third-party locations. We seek to place our slot machines and amusement devices in strategic, high-traffic areas, including our branded taverns, and the majority of our marketing efforts are focused on maximizing profitability from a high-frequency, convenience-driven customer base.
Our sales and marketing efforts include our consolidated loyalty program, True Rewards®, designed to encourage repeat business at our properties, branded taverns and other participating distributed gaming locations, as discussed below.
Responsible Marketing & Advertising
We consider responsible gaming to be an important part of our overall marketing strategy. Our marketing practices adhere to legal and regulatory requirements, and we put a significant emphasis on raising awareness about our commitment to responsible gaming to mitigate risks and promote a healthy gaming experience throughout our properties and branded tavern locations. 
We include a toll-free help number and responsible gaming messaging at all of our properties and branded tavern locations. We strictly prohibit any marketing and advertisements directed toward underage persons or high-risk individuals. Our patrons have an opportunity to be removed from any promotional mailings and gambling on site by requesting to be a part of our self-exclusion program.
We regularly train our team members on ways to detect and prevent minors from gambling and consuming alcohol or loitering in designated gaming areas. In addition, all of our team members are required to complete annual training on responsible gaming.
True Rewards Loyalty Program
Our marketing efforts seek to capitalize on repeat visitation through the use of our True Rewards loyalty program. We offer our True Rewards loyalty program at all ten of our casino properties, as well as at all of our branded taverns and other participating distributed gaming locations. Members of our True Rewards loyalty program earn points based on gaming activity and food and beverage purchases at our casino properties, branded taverns and participating distributed gaming locations. Loyalty points are redeemable for slot play, promotional table game chips, food and beverages and grocery gift cards. All points earned in the loyalty program roll up into a single account balance which is redeemable at over 140 participating locations.
Our rewards technology is designed to track customer behavior indicators such as visitation, customer spend and customer engagement. As of December 31, 2022, we had nearly 656,000 active players in our marketing database, providing us with an avenue to drive customer engagement and cross-marketing opportunities across our casino and distributed gaming platform.
Intellectual Property
We pursue registration of our important trademarks and service marks in the states where we do business and with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have registered and/or have pending as trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, among other trademarks and service marks, “Golden Entertainment” and “Golden Gaming,” as well as various names, brands and logos relating to our casino properties, customer loyalty programs and branded taverns. In addition, we have also registered or applied to register numerous other trademarks in various jurisdictions in the United States in connection with our properties, facilities and development projects. We also hold a patent in the United States related to player tracking systems.
Competition
The casino, tavern and distributed gaming industries are highly competitive. Our casino business competes with numerous casinos and casino-hotels of varying quality and size in our markets. We also compete with other non-gaming resorts and vacation destinations, and with various other casino and other entertainment businesses. The casino entertainment business is characterized by competitors that vary considerably in their size, quality of facilities, number of operations, brand identities, marketing and growth strategies, financial strength and capabilities, level of amenities, management talent and geographic diversity. Many of our regional and national competitors have greater brand recognition and significantly greater resources than we have. Their greater resources may also provide them with the ability to expand operations in the future. 
Furthermore, several states are currently considering legalizing casino gaming in designated areas, and Native American tribes may develop or expand gaming properties in markets located more closely to our customer base (particularly Native American casinos located in California and Arizona). The expansion of casino gaming in or near any geographic area from which we attract or expect to attract a significant number of our customers, including legalized casino gaming in neighboring states and on Native American land, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
With respect to our branded taverns and distributed gaming operations, we face competition from other operators of casinos, hotels, taverns and other entertainment venues, as well as from others involved in the distributed gaming business. 
In addition, we face ever-increasing competition from online gaming, including mobile gaming applications for smart phones and tablet computers, state-sponsored lotteries, card clubs, sports books, fantasy sports websites and other forms of legalized gaming. Various forms of internet gaming have been approved in Nevada, and legislation permitting internet gaming has been proposed by the federal government and other states. The expansion of internet gaming in Nevada and other jurisdictions could result in significant additional competition for our operations.
Regulation
Gaming Regulation
We are subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulation. State and local government authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate require us to obtain gaming licenses and require our officers, key employees and business entity affiliates to demonstrate suitability to be involved in gaming operations. These are privileged licenses or approvals which are not guaranteed by statute or regulation. State and local government authorities may limit, condition, suspend or revoke a license, impose substantial fines, and take other actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain and maintain the gaming licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our gaming operations. Any failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses, registrations, permits or approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of 
operations and prospects. Furthermore, if additional gaming laws or regulations are adopted, these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us and our business. For additional information, refer to the risk factor entitled “Our business is subject to extensive gaming regulation, which is costly to comply with, and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations” in “Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
Gaming authorities may, in their sole and absolute discretion, require the holder of any securities issued by us to file applications, be investigated, and be found suitable to own our securities if they have reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of their respective states. Further, the costs of any investigation conducted by any gaming authority under these circumstances is typically required to be paid by the applicant, and refusal or failure to pay these charges may constitute grounds for a finding that the applicant is unsuitable to own the securities. Our Articles of Incorporation require our shareholders to cooperate with gaming authorities in such investigations and permit us to redeem the securities held by any shareholder whose holding of shares of our capital stock may result, in the judgment of our Board of Directors, in our failure to obtain or our loss of any license or franchise from any governmental agency held by us to conduct any portion of our business. If any gaming authority determines that a person is unsuitable to own our securities, then, under the applicable gaming laws and regulations, we can be sanctioned, including the loss of our privileged licenses or approvals, if, without the prior approval of the applicable gaming authority, we conduct certain business with the unsuitable person. For additional information, refer to the risk factor entitled “Our shareholders are subject to extensive governmental regulation and, if a shareholder is found unsuitable by a gaming authority, that shareholder would not be able to beneficially own our common stock directly or indirectly. Our shareholders may also be required to provide information that is requested by gaming authorities and we have the right, under certain circumstances, to redeem a shareholder’s securities; we may be forced to use our cash or incur debt to fund redemption of our securities” in “Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
Our directors, officers and key employees are also subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and various privileged licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities. If any gaming authority with jurisdiction over our business were to find any of our directors, officers or key employees unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever our relationship with that person. Furthermore, such gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Either result could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and prospects.
Applicable gaming laws and regulations also restrict our ability to issue securities, incur debt, and undertake other financing activities. Such transactions would generally require approval of gaming authorities, and our financing counterparties, including lenders, might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities. If state regulatory authorities were to find any person unsuitable with regard to his, her or its relationship to us or any of our subsidiaries, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person, which could materially adversely affect our business.
The gaming industry also represents a significant source of tax revenue, particularly to the State of Nevada and its counties and municipalities. From time to time, various federal, state and local legislators and other government officials have proposed and adopted changes in tax laws, or in the administration or interpretation of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. It is not possible to determine the likelihood of possible changes in tax laws or in the administration or interpretation of such laws. Such changes, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. For additional information, refer to the risk factor entitled “Changes to gaming tax laws could increase our cost of doing business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition” in “Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
From time to time, local and state lawmakers, as well as special interest groups, have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any such change to the regulatory environment or the adoption of new federal, state or local government legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Other Regulation
Our business is subject to a variety of other federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Changes to any of the laws, rules, regulations or ordinances to which we are subject, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to emissions and discharges into the environment, and the storage, handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes. These laws and regulations are complex, and subject to change, and violations can lead to significant costs for corrective action and remediation, fines and penalties. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating contamination on its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants, and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were legal at the time that they occurred, as well as incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination. The presence of contamination, or failure to remediate it properly, may adversely affect our ability to use, sell or rent property. As we acquire additional casino, resort and tavern properties, we may not know the full level of exposure that we may have undertaken despite appropriate due diligence. We endeavor to maintain compliance with environmental laws, but from time to time, current or historical operations on or adjacent to, our properties may have resulted or may result in noncompliance with environmental laws or liability for cleanup pursuant to environmental laws. In that regard, we may incur costs for cleaning up contamination relating to historical uses of certain properties.
Many of our employees, especially those that interact with our customers, receive a base salary or wage that is established by applicable state and federal laws that establish a minimum hourly wage that is, in turn, supplemented through tips and gratuities from customers. From time to time, state and federal lawmakers have increased the minimum wage. It is difficult to predict when such increases may take place. Any such change to the minimum wage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our branded taverns and casino properties to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county or municipal authority for a license or permit to sell alcoholic beverages. In addition, each restaurant we operate must obtain a food service license from local authorities. Failure to comply with such regulations could cause our licenses to be revoked or our related business or businesses to be forced to cease operations. Moreover, state liquor laws may prevent the expansion of restaurant operations into certain markets.
Seasonality
We believe that our businesses are affected by seasonal factors, including holidays, weather and travel conditions. Our casino properties, branded taverns and distributed gaming businesses in Nevada have historically experienced lower revenues during the summer as a result of fewer tourists due to higher temperatures, as well as increased vacation activity by local residents. Rocky Gap typically experiences higher revenues during summer months and may be significantly adversely impacted by inclement weather during winter months. Our Nevada branded taverns and distributed gaming operations typically experience higher revenues during the fall which corresponds with several professional sports seasons. Our Montana distributed gaming operations typically experience higher revenues during the winter due to the inclement weather in the state and less opportunity for outdoor activities, in addition to the impact from professional sports seasons during the fall. While other factors like unemployment levels, market competition and the diversification of our business may either offset or magnify seasonal effects, some seasonality is likely to continue, which could result in significant fluctuation in our quarterly operating results.
Social Responsibility and Environmental Stewardship
We believe that our organization’s environmental and social goals as well as our team members’ involvement have a positive impact on the community. We are proud to be involved in various charitable events, including an annual fundraiser for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”), the Keep Memory Alive foundation for brain disorders, Scale The STRAT for the American Lung Association, and others. We have been contributing to the AAA Scholarship fund since 2018 and donate over $100,000 each year. We support food security programs, including but not limited to, Feed a Family, Meals for Christmas and Thanksgiving, and Meals for the Nevada Housing Authority, and our team members volunteer in food banks. In addition, Golden participates in “adopt the school” programs in each community we operate in and supports local schools through both charitable donations and supply drives. 
We engage in responsible gaming practices and are committed to promoting such practices and providing responsible gaming information to our customers. We are a member of the Nevada Council on Problem Gaming and have contributed over $300,000 to the organization since 2015. 
We are also committed to energy efficiency, and we have replaced older light bulbs and fixtures with more efficient devices at all our properties. We are planning to install electric vehicle (“EV”) charging stations at The STRAT as well as our other casino properties. 
We are currently evaluating our water management and water efficiency programs with plans to implement additional programs in the future. Our goal is to reduce our consumptive water use and invest more efforts in water reuse and conservation 
programs. For example, we implemented xeriscaping as an environmental design choice, which allows for a reduction in our water usage and maintenance costs associated with commercial landscaping and allows us to adapt to the current pressures around monitoring and minimizing water usage. We plan to increase our investment in smart technologies that allow us to track our usage of utilities more efficiently and to prioritize budgeting for water-efficient equipment and appliances. 
COVID-19 Response and Ongoing Focus on Team Member Well-being
Our response to the COVID-19 outbreak demonstrates our commitment to the community, our team members, and guests. We made COVID-19 and influenza vaccines available to all our team members and their family members free of charge, and implemented a number of health and safety protocols. These measures included enhanced sanitization, public gathering and capacity limitations, patron social distancing requirements, restrictions on permitted hours of operations, limitations on casino operations, which included disabling electronic gaming machines, and face mask and temperature check requirements for patrons. 
In addition, we continue to offer a number of on-site health clinics to ensure the health and well-being of our team members. Such clinics are offered free of charge and include, but are not limited to, dental exams, preventative care health screenings, and mental health awareness and support. Our team members have access to medical, pharmacy and vision coverage, life and other types of insurance offerings, flexible spending accounts, and various employee assistance programs. Our goal is to create benefit offerings that meet the needs of our diverse workforce across our casino properties, branded taverns, and distributed gaming locations.
Human Capital
We are committed to recruiting, developing and retaining a superior workforce. We have a long history and deep cultural commitment to service and authenticity. As of December 31, 2022, we employed over 6,400 team members, which is a 2% increase from December 31, 2021 when we had approximately 6,300 employees. Our efforts to re-staff since the COVID-19 closures contributed to the increase in team members in 2022. 
Mission and Values
In 2022, we continued to emphasize our organizational mission and values, as well as our “I CARE” guest service initiative. Our mission is to create authentic entertainment experiences where premium service is delivered at an exceptional value.
Our core mission is:
•To provide exceptional service to our guests
•To be accountable to each other
•To have integrity in all interactions
•To be urgent with purpose in our efforts
Our human capital initiatives reflect our commitment to aligning our workforce with our mission and values. 
Recruitment
In 2022, we offered employment to 5,729 candidates from a total pool of 40,818 applications, or 14% of total applications, and over 3,700 of the offers converted to new hires. Compared to 2021, we received 8,943 more applications in 2022, a 28% increase from the previous year. In 2022, the average hire time was 14 days, which was a decrease from 52 days in 2021. We recruit applicants by utilizing various recruitment platforms and sources in an effort to secure a diverse pool of applicants and ensure sustainability of our talent pipeline. We offer referral and retention incentives to remain competitive in a limited labor market. We also made wage adjustments throughout Golden to remain competitive with market conditions and to improve retention in line level positions.
In 2022, we continued our relationships with various local non-profit organizations to connect job seekers with employment opportunities within Golden and attended numerous career fairs throughout the year. We enhanced job skills training initiatives so that those with a skills gap or no prior experience could receive training enabling them to perform job duties. Further, we established company-wide behavioral interviewing standards and training to support investment in our top talent. Our number one applicant source is Indeed, followed by our company site, and team member referrals. 
Team Member Benefits
We engage with a nationally recognized compensation and benefits consulting firm to independently evaluate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our benefits program within the industry. As a diverse organization, we offer our team members several options for annual benefits enrollment, including enrollment by telephone, online or through an app, and we support multi-lingual options. Our comprehensive benefits program provides our team members with the flexibility to choose their preferred medical, dental and vision plans. In addition, we offer telemedicine, flexible spending and health savings accounts, life insurance and a retirement plan that provides an annual discretionary match. We also offer a variety of optional benefits to promote the health and security of our employees and their families, including disability insurance and expanded life insurance coverage, critical illness and accident insurance, legal, identity theft, auto and home insurance, and pet insurance. We view mental health services as a fundamental part of our benefits program and offer a comprehensive suite of related benefits, including online mental health counseling through our team member assistance program. Additionally, we offer extended benefits to employees with disabilities and chronic health conditions, including no cost Medicare and Medicaid assistance programs and prescription savings solutions for team members with chronic health conditions.
Training, Employee Retention and Development
We consider employee training, retention, and development to be an important part of our overall employee professional development policy, as such initiatives also lead to a higher level of team member engagement and job satisfaction. 
In 2022, we enhanced our learning management system, internally branded as “GEMS,” by adding 40 learning opportunities. New leader orientation and tavern leadership training has been facilitated through a monthly virtual classroom in the learning management system. Additionally, all safety and compliance training, except certain required hands-on certifications, are part of the online curriculum. Certifications have been assigned to manage reoccurring safety and compliance requirements, including COVID-19 safety protocols. We have also invested in equipment and resources to make online training more accessible to our team members, which resulted in over 82,000 training courses completed in 2022.
In 2022, we launched our Golden Women’s Group (“GWG”), a women’s leadership development program. GWG is a group for Golden’s team members dedicated to the workplace advancement of women. The mission of the GWG is to promote a support network among its members and to provide mentoring and professional education for established and emerging women within our organization. The focus of this program is to build leadership skills and strategies that will positively impact the GWG class members by enhancing their professional skill set and relationships. 
Our investment in our team members’ talent and ongoing development is one of the key aspects of our employee retention efforts, as we believe that creating an involved environment for our team members sets us apart from our competitors and makes us an attractive employer. We consider employee retention to be an integral part of our overall employment strategy and invest in the continuous development of our team members and their growth within the company.

Data Privacy and Cybersecurity
We maintain cybersecurity awareness and training programs through our GEMS platform as well as through our internal policies and certifications, which are subject to review and oversight by our management and our Board of Directors. All newly hired team members are required to take training courses with particular focus on the acceptable use of technology and related cybersecurity risks. E-mail phishing training is performed routinely throughout the year. Additional training is performed for those with remote work capabilities.
Members of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors receive regular updates on cybersecurity matters, including metrics, investments, and capabilities. The General Counsel, Chief Technology Officer, and key information technology team members from the security, compliance, and vendor management office meet on a bi-weekly basis to discuss the results of our cybersecurity and privacy matters and to evaluate new technologies from a security, operational, and regulatory perspective prior to their implementation.
Our cybersecurity program and policy documents are reviewed and updated annually. Our risk-based incident response plan is subject to an annual detailed review with any updates communicated to the leadership team. Our information technology senior leadership and key management team members perform tabletop exercises at least annually in order to be prepared for execution of the defined incident response plan.
We use the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Framework to assess risk management against our cybersecurity capabilities. We use the Mitre Att&ck Framework in combination with a managed security service provider to detect and protect against cybersecurity threats. State privacy laws are continually evaluated and applied as required (e.g., Nevada, California, Massachusetts, New York, etc.). In addition, the Nevada Gaming Control Board issues information technology internal control standards, which we use to evaluate our internal and external audit procedures on an annual basis.
