Property and Casualty Insurance Segment
General
AFG’s property and casualty insurance operations provide a wide range of commercial coverages through over 30 niche insurance businesses that make up the Great American Insurance Group. AFG’s property and casualty insurance operations ultimately report to a single senior executive and operate under a business model that allows local decision-making for underwriting, claims and policy servicing in each of the niche operations. Each business is managed by experienced professionals in particular lines or customer groups and operates autonomously but with certain central controls and accountability. The decentralized approach allows each unit the autonomy necessary to respond to local and specialty market conditions while capitalizing on the efficiencies of centralized investment and administrative support functions. AFG’s property and casualty insurance operations employed approximately 6,700 people as of December 31, 2018. These operations are conducted through the subsidiaries listed in the following table, which includes independent financial strength ratings and 2018 gross written premiums (in millions) for each major subsidiary. These ratings are generally based on concerns for policyholders and agents and are not directed toward the protection of investors. AFG believes that maintaining a rating in the “A” category by A.M. Best is important to compete successfully in most lines of business.

The primary objectives of AFG’s property and casualty insurance operations are to achieve solid underwriting profitability and provide excellent service to its policyholders and agents. Underwriting profitability is measured by the combined ratio, which is a sum of the ratios of losses, loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”), underwriting expenses and policyholder dividends to premiums. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit. The combined ratio does not reflect investment income, other income or federal income taxes.
While many costs included in underwriting are readily determined (commissions, administrative expenses and many of the losses on claims reported), the process of determining overall underwriting results is highly dependent upon the use of estimates in the case of losses incurred or expected but not yet reported or developed. Actuarial procedures and projections are 
2

used to obtain “point estimates” of ultimate losses. While the process is imprecise and develops amounts which are subject to change over time, management believes that the liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are adequate.
Financial information is reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for shareholder and other investor-related purposes and reported on a statutory basis for U.S. insurance regulatory purposes. Unless indicated otherwise, the financial information presented in the Form 10-K for AFG’s property and casualty insurance operations is presented based on GAAP. Statutory information is only prepared for AFG’s U.S.-based subsidiaries, which represented approximately 91% of AFG’s direct written premiums in 2018, and is provided for industry comparisons or where comparable GAAP information is not readily available.
Major differences for statutory accounting include charging policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred rather than spreading the costs over the periods covered by the policies; reporting investment grade bonds and redeemable preferred stocks at amortized cost rather than fair value; netting of reinsurance recoverables and prepaid reinsurance premiums against the corresponding liabilities rather than reporting such items separately; and charging to surplus certain GAAP assets, such as furniture and fixtures and agents’ balances over 90 days old.
AFG’s statutory combined ratio averaged 91.7% for the period 2016 to 2018 as compared to 101.8% for the property and casualty industry over the same period (Sources: Conning, Inc.’s Property - Casualty Forecast & Analysis (Fourth Quarter 2018 Edition, used with permission) and A.M. Best’s Review & Preview Report (February 2018 Edition)). AFG believes that its specialty niche focus, product line diversification and underwriting discipline have contributed to the Company’s ability to consistently outperform the industry’s underwriting results. Management’s philosophy is to refrain from writing business that is not expected to produce an underwriting profit even if it is necessary to limit premium growth to do so.
Property and Casualty Results
Performance measures such as underwriting profit or loss and related combined ratios are often used by property and casualty insurers to help users of their financial statements better understand the company’s performance. See Note C — “Segments of Operations” to the financial statements for the reconciliation of AFG’s earnings before income taxes by significant business segment to the statement of earnings.
The following table shows the performance of AFG’s property and casualty insurance operations (dollars in millions):

As with other property and casualty insurers, AFG’s operating results can be adversely affected by unpredictable catastrophe losses. Certain natural disasters (hurricanes, severe storms, earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, etc.) and other incidents of major loss (explosions, civil disorder, terrorist events, fires, etc.) are classified as catastrophes by industry associations. Losses from these incidents are usually tracked separately from other business of insurers because of their sizable effects on overall operations. Total net losses to AFG’s insurance operations from current accident year catastrophes were $103 million in 2018, $140 million in 2017 and $55 million in 2016 and are included in the table above.
AFG generally seeks to reduce its exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection, including minimizing coastal and known fault-line exposures, and the purchase of reinsurance. AFG’s net exposure to a catastrophic earthquake or windstorm that industry models indicate should statistically occur once in every 500 years (a “500-year event”) is expected to be approximately 6% of AFG’s Shareholders’ Equity.
Property and Casualty Insurance Products
AFG is focused on growth opportunities in what it believes to be more profitable specialty businesses where AFG personnel are experts in particular lines of business or customer groups. The following are examples of AFG’s specialty businesses:

Property and Transportation | 
Inland and Ocean Marine | Provides coverage primarily for builders’ risk, contractors’ equipment, property, motor truck cargo, marine cargo, boat dealers, marina operators/dealers and excursion vessels. 
Agricultural-related | Provides federally reinsured multi-peril crop (allied lines) insurance covering most perils as well as crop-hail, equine mortality and other coverages for full-time operating farms/ranches and agribusiness operations on a nationwide basis.
Commercial Automobile | Provides coverage for vehicles (such as buses and trucks) in a broad range of businesses including the moving and storage and transportation industries, and a specialized physical damage product for the trucking industry. 
Specialty Casualty | 
Executive and Professional Liability | Markets coverage for directors and officers of businesses and non-profit organizations; errors and omissions; cyber; and mergers and acquisitions. 
Umbrella and Excess Liability | Provides liability coverage in excess of primary layers. 
Excess and Surplus | Provides liability, umbrella and excess coverage for unique, volatile or hard to place risks, using rates and forms that generally do not have to be approved by state insurance regulators. 
General Liability | Provides coverage for contractor-related businesses, energy development and production risks, and environmental liability risks. 
Targeted Programs | Includes coverage (primarily liability and property) for social service agencies, leisure, entertainment and non-profit organizations, customized solutions for other targeted markets and alternative risk programs using agency captives. 
Workers’ Compensation | Provides coverage for prescribed benefits payable to employees who are injured on the job. 
Specialty Financial | 
Fidelity and Surety | Provides fidelity and crime coverage for government, mercantile and financial institutions and surety coverage for various types of contractors and public and private corporations. 
Lease and Loan Services | Provides coverage for insurance risk management programs for lending and leasing institutions, including equipment leasing and collateral and lender-placed mortgage property insurance. 

Management believes specialization is the key element to the underwriting success of these business units. These specialty businesses are opportunistic and their premium volume will vary based on prevailing market conditions. AFG continually evaluates expansion in existing markets and opportunities in new specialty markets that meet its profitability objectives. Likewise, AFG will withdraw from markets that do not meet its profit objectives or business strategy.

Premium Distribution
The following table shows the net written premiums by sub-segment for AFG’s property and casualty insurance operations for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Property and transportation | $ | 1,754 | | | $ | 1,765 | | $ | 1,672
Specialty casualty | 2,509 | | | 2,280 | | | 2,036
Specialty financial | 602 | | | 596 | | | 572 
Other | 158 | | | 110 | | | 106 
 | $ | 5,023 | | | $ | 4,751 | | $ | 4,386


The geographic distribution of statutory direct written premiums by AFG’s U.S.-based insurers for 2018, 2017 and 2016 is shown below. Approximately 9% of AFG’s direct written premiums in 2018 were derived from non U.S.-based insurers, primarily Neon, a United Kingdom-based Lloyd’s insurer.

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | | | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
California | 13.5 | % | | 13.2 | % | 14.3 | % | | Missouri | | 2.5 | % | 2.8 | % | 2.7 | %

Reinsurance
Consistent with standard practice of most insurance companies, AFG reinsures a portion of its property and casualty business with other insurance companies and assumes a relatively small amount of business from other insurers. AFG uses reinsurance for two primary purposes: (i) to provide higher limits of coverage than it would otherwise be willing to provide (i.e. large line capacity) and (ii) to protect its business by reducing the impact of catastrophes. The availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, which may affect the volume and profitability of business that is written. AFG is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurers, as the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not relieve AFG of its liability to its insureds until claims are fully settled.
Reinsurance is provided on one of two bases, facultative or treaty. Facultative reinsurance is generally provided on a risk-by-risk basis. Individual risks are ceded and assumed based on an offer and acceptance of risk by each party to the transaction. AFG purchases facultative reinsurance, both pro rata and excess of loss, depending on the risk and available reinsurance markets. Treaty reinsurance provides for risks meeting prescribed criteria to be automatically ceded and assumed according to contract provisions.
Catastrophe Reinsurance AFG has taken steps to limit its exposure to wind and earthquake losses through individual risk selection, including minimizing coastal and known fault-line exposures, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance. Catastrophe reinsurance is purchased separately for AFG’s U.S. property and casualty insurance group and for Neon, AFG’s Lloyd’s insurance business. In addition, AFG purchases catastrophe reinsurance for its workers’ compensation businesses. Although the cost of catastrophe reinsurance varies depending on exposure and the level of worldwide loss activity, AFG continues to obtain reinsurance coverage in adequate amounts at acceptable rates.
In June 2017, AFG’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries entered into a reinsurance agreement to obtain supplemental catastrophe protection through a catastrophe bond structure with Riverfront Re Ltd. (“Riverfront”). The reinsurance agreement provides supplemental reinsurance coverage up to 95% of $200 million (fully collateralized) for catastrophe losses in excess of $104 million (per occurrence and annual aggregate) occurring between June 1, 2017 and December 31, 2020. In connection with the reinsurance agreement, Riverfront issued notes to unrelated investors for the full amount of coverage provided under the reinsurance agreement. Riverfront is a variable interest entity in which AFG does not have a variable interest because the variability in Riverfront’s results will be absorbed entirely by the investors in Riverfront. Accordingly, Riverfront is not 
5

consolidated in AFG’s financial statements and the reinsurance agreement is accounted for as ceded reinsurance. AFG’s cost for this coverage is approximately $11 million per year.
In January 2018, Neon launched NCM Re (UK PCC) Ltd. (“NCM Re”), the first insurance-linked securities (“ILS”) vehicle in the United Kingdom (“UK”). NCM Re utilizes recently approved UK regulations to provide Neon with the ability to further enhance its global reinsurance offering to clients. NCM Re uses a range of catastrophe modeling and pricing techniques to make use of Neon’s underwriting and risk selection skills to source business for third-party ILS investors in the capital markets. In early 2019, NCM Re completed its second ILS transaction, which provides $77 million in collateralized quota share reinsurance that assumed 17.1% of the Neon Lloyd’s syndicate’s property treaty reinsurance and direct and facultative portfolios. Losses are recovered from NCM Re before Neon’s catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance coverage applies. In addition to NCM Re, Neon also placed a 25.5% quota share reinsurance treaty covering its property insurance and a further 7.1% quota share treaty covering its property insurance placed under binding authorities.
Also in January 2019, AFG’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries renewed their catastrophe reinsurance coverages. For AFG’s U.S. based operations, the Company continued to place $85 million of coverage in excess of a $15 million per event primary retention in the traditional reinsurance markets. Neon placed $225 million of coverage in excess of a $25 million per event primary retention. For the catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance coverage, recoveries from NCM Re and Neon’s property insurance quota share apply before calculating losses recoverable from the catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance treaty. In addition to Neon’s catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance coverage, Neon has placed a quota share treaty which covers 12.8% of Neon’s gross property losses with a $510 million event limit (maximum $65 million recoverable) which supplements its catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance coverage and property quota share coverages up to the event limit; recoveries from this quota share treaty also apply before calculating losses recoverable from the catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance treaty.
The commercial marketplace requires large policy limits ($25 million or more) in several of AFG’s lines of business, including certain executive and professional liability, umbrella and excess liability, and fidelity and surety coverages. Since these limits exceed management’s desired exposure to an individual risk, AFG generally enters into reinsurance agreements to reduce its net exposure under such policies to an acceptable level. Reinsurance continues to be available for this large line capacity exposure with satisfactory pricing and terms.
In addition to the catastrophe and large line capacity reinsurance programs discussed above, AFG purchases reinsurance on a product-by-product basis. AFG regularly reviews the financial strength of its current and potential reinsurers. These reviews include consideration of credit ratings, available capital, claims paying history and expertise. This process periodically results in the transfer of risks to more financially secure reinsurers. Substantially all reinsurance is ceded to companies with investment grade S&P ratings or is secured by “funds withheld” or other collateral. Under “funds withheld” arrangements, AFG retains ceded premiums to fund ceded losses as they become due from the reinsurer. Recoverables from the following companies were individually between 5% and 10% of AFG’s total property and casualty reinsurance recoverable (including prepaid reinsurance premiums and net of payables to reinsurers) at December 31, 2018: Hannover Rueck SE, Munich Reinsurance America, Inc. and Swiss Reinsurance America Corporation. In addition, AFG has a reinsurance recoverable from Ohio Casualty Insurance Company of $149 million related to that company’s purchase of AFG’s commercial lines business in 1998. No other reinsurers exceeded 5% of AFG’s property and casualty reinsurance recoverable.

The following table presents (by type of coverage) the amount of each loss above the specified retention covered by treaty reinsurance programs in AFG’s U.S.-based property and casualty insurance operations (in millions) as of January 1, 2019:

(a) | Includes the participation of AFG’s internal reinsurance program.


(b) | Maximum loss per event for claims up to reinsurance coverage limit.


(c) | Neon’s excess of loss catastrophe reinsurance limits the maximum retained loss per event to $25 million for a U.S. catastrophe and $15 million for a non-U.S. catastrophe until such coverage is exhausted. During 2019, Neon intends to evaluate purchasing additional catastrophe reinsurance to reduce its maximum retained loss per event from a U.S. catastrophe to $15 million.


(d) | Includes aggregate coverage. See description above.

In addition to the coverage shown above, AFG reinsures a portion of its crop insurance business through the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (“FCIC”). The FCIC offers both proportional (or “quota share”) and non-proportional coverages. The proportional coverage provides that a fixed percentage of risk is assumed by the FCIC. The non-proportional coverage allows AFG to select desired retention of risk on a state-by-state, county, crop or plan basis. AFG typically reinsures 15% to 25% of gross written premiums with the FCIC. AFG also purchases quota share reinsurance in the private market. This quota share provides for a ceding commission to AFG and a profit sharing provision. During 2018 and 2017, AFG reinsured 50% and 52.5%, respectively, of premiums not reinsured by the FCIC in the private market and purchased stop loss protection coverage for the remaining portion of the business. In 2019, AFG expects to reinsure 50% of the premiums not reinsured by the FCIC in the private market.
The balance sheet caption “recoverables from reinsurers” included approximately $109 million on paid losses and LAE and $2.94 billion on unpaid losses and LAE at December 31, 2018. These amounts are net of allowances of approximately $18 million for doubtful collection of reinsurance recoverables. The collectibility of a reinsurance balance is based upon the financial condition of a reinsurer as well as individual claim considerations.
Reinsurance premiums ceded and assumed are presented in the following table (in millions):

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Reinsurance ceded | $ | 1,817 | | | $ | 1,751 | | $ | 1,595
Reinsurance ceded, excluding crop | 1,202 | | | 1,076 | | | 985
Reinsurance assumed — including involuntary pools and associations | 214 | | | 192 | | | 123

Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves
The consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE of AFG’s insurance subsidiaries. This liability represents estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and LAE and is determined by using case-basis evaluations, actuarial projections and management’s judgment. These estimates are subject to the effects of changes in claim amounts and frequency and are periodically reviewed and adjusted as additional information becomes known. In accordance with industry practices, such adjustments are reflected in current year operations. Generally, reserves for reinsurance assumed and involuntary pools and associations are reflected in AFG’s results at the amounts reported by those entities. See Note O — “Insurance — Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves” to the financial statements for information 
7

on the development of AFG’s liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses by accident year as well as a progression of the liability on a GAAP basis over the past three years. 
The differences between the liability for losses and LAE reported in the annual statements filed with the state insurance departments in accordance with statutory accounting principles (“SAP”) and that reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP at December 31, 2018 are as follows (in millions):

Liability reported on a SAP basis, net of $145 million of retroactive reinsurance | $ | 6,234
Reinsurance recoverables, net of allowance | 2,942 | 
Other, including reserves of foreign insurers | 565 | 
Liability reported on a GAAP basis | $ | 9,741

Asbestos and Environmental (“A&E”) Reserves   AFG’s property and casualty group, like many others in the industry, has A&E claims arising in most cases from general liability policies written more than thirty years ago. The establishment of reserves for such A&E claims presents unique and difficult challenges and is subject to uncertainties significantly greater than those presented by other types of claims. For a discussion of these uncertainties, see Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis — “Uncertainties — Asbestos and Environmental-related (“A&E”) Insurance Reserves” and Note M — “Contingencies” to the financial statements.
The following table (in millions) is a progression of the property and casualty group’s A&E reserves.
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Reserves at beginning of year | $ | 403 | | | $ | 337 | | | $ | 327
Incurred losses and LAE | 18 | | | 89 | | | 36 | 
Paid losses and LAE | (26 | ) | | (23 | ) | | (26 | )
Reserves at end of year, net of reinsurance recoverable | 395 | | | 403 | | | 337 | 
Reinsurance recoverable, net of allowance | 129 | | | 125 | | | 106 | 
Gross reserves at end of year | $ | 524 | | | $ | 528 | | | $ | 443

In addition to its ongoing internal monitoring of asbestos and environmental exposures, AFG has periodically conducted comprehensive external studies of its asbestos and environmental reserves relating to the run-off operations of its property and casualty insurance segment and exposures related to its former railroad and manufacturing operations with the aid of specialty actuarial, engineering and consulting firms and outside counsel, every two years in recent periods, with an in-depth internal review during the intervening years. AFG is currently evaluating the frequency of future external studies.
An in-depth internal review of AFG’s A&E reserves was completed in the third quarter of 2018 by AFG’s internal A&E claims specialists in consultation with specialty outside counsel and an outside consultant. As a result of the review, AFG’s property and casualty insurance segment recorded an $18 million pretax special charge to increase its asbestos reserves by $6 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $12 million (net of reinsurance). Over the past few years, the focus of AFG’s asbestos claims litigation has shifted to smaller companies and companies with ancillary exposures. AFG’s insureds with these exposures have been the driver of the property and casualty segment’s asbestos reserve increases in recent years. AFG is seeing modestly increasing estimates for indemnity and defense compared to prior studies on certain specific open claims.
The increase in property and casualty environmental reserves in 2018 (as well as in 2017 and 2016) was primarily associated with updated estimates of site investigation and remedial costs with respect to existing sites and newly identified sites. AFG has updated its view of legal defense costs on open environmental claims as well as a number of claims and sites where the estimated investigation and remediation costs have increased. As in recent past years, there were no new or emerging broad industry trends that were identified in this review.
As a result of the comprehensive external study completed in the third quarter of 2017, AFG’s property and casualty insurance segment recorded an $89 million pretax special charge to increase its asbestos reserves by $53 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $36 million (net of reinsurance).
An in-depth internal review of AFG’s A&E reserves was completed in the third quarter of 2016. As a result of the review, AFG’s property and casualty insurance segment recorded a $36 million pretax special charge to increase its asbestos reserves by $5 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $31 million (net of reinsurance).

Marketing
The property and casualty insurance group directs its sales efforts primarily through independent insurance agents and brokers, although small portions are written through employee agents. Independent agents and brokers generally receive a commission on the sale of each policy. Some agents and brokers are eligible for a bonus commission based on the overall profitability of policies placed with AFG by the broker or agent in a particular year. The property and casualty insurance group writes insurance through several thousand agents and brokers.
Competition
AFG’s property and casualty insurance businesses compete with other individual insurers, state funds and insurance groups of varying sizes, some of which are mutual insurance companies possessing competitive advantages in that all their profits inure to their policyholders. See Item 1A — Risk Factors. They also compete with self-insurance plans, captive programs and risk retention groups. Due to the specialty nature of these coverages, competition is based primarily on service to policyholders and agents, specific characteristics of products offered and reputation for claims handling. Financial strength ratings, price, commissions and profit sharing terms are also important factors. Management believes that sophisticated data analysis for refinement of risk profiles, extensive specialized knowledge and loss prevention service have helped AFG compete successfully.
Annuity Segment
General
AFG sells traditional fixed, fixed-indexed and variable-indexed annuities in the retail, financial institutions, broker-dealer and registered investment advisor markets through independent producers and through direct relationships with certain financial institutions. The annuity operations employed approximately 600 people at December 31, 2018. These operations are conducted primarily through the subsidiaries listed in the following table, which includes 2018 statutory annuity premiums (in millions), annuity policies in force and independent ratings.

 | | | Annuity | | | 
 | Annuity | | Policies | | Ratings
Company | Premiums | | In Force | | AM Best | S&P
Great American Life Insurance Company | $ | 5,212 | | | 423,000 | | A | | A+
Annuity Investors Life Insurance Company | 195 | | | 111,000 | | A | | A+

AFG believes that the ratings assigned by independent insurance rating agencies are an important competitive factor because agents, potential policyholders and financial institutions often use a company’s rating as an initial screening device in considering annuity products. AFG believes that a rating in the “A” category by at least one rating agency is necessary to successfully compete in its primary annuity markets.
Due to the deposit-type nature of annuities, annuity premiums received and benefit payments are recorded as increases or decreases in the annuity benefits accumulated liability rather than as revenue and expense under GAAP. Statutory premiums of AFG’s annuity operations for the last three years were as follows (in millions):

Annuities are long-term retirement saving instruments that benefit from income accruing on a tax-deferred basis. The issuer of the annuity collects premiums, credits interest or earnings on the policy and pays out a benefit upon death, surrender or annuitization. Single premium annuities are generally issued in exchange for a one-time lump-sum premium payment. Certain annuities, primarily in the education market, have premium payments that are flexible in both amount and timing as determined by the policyholder and are generally made through payroll deductions. 
Annuity contracts are generally classified as either fixed rate (including fixed-indexed and variable-indexed) or variable. With a traditional fixed rate annuity, AFG seeks to maintain a desired spread between the yield on its investment portfolio and the rate it credits to policyholders. AFG accomplishes this by: (i) offering crediting rates that it has the option to change after any initial guarantee period (subject to minimum interest rate and other contractual guarantees); (ii) designing annuity products that encourage persistency; and (iii) maintaining an appropriate matching of assets and liabilities.
An indexed annuity provides policyholders with the opportunity to receive a crediting rate tied, in part, to the performance of an existing market index (generally the S&P 500) or other external rate, price, or unit value (an “index”). A fixed-indexed annuity protects against the related downside risk through a guarantee of principal (excluding surrender charges, market value adjustments, and certain benefit charges). In 2018, AFG began offering variable-indexed annuities, which are similar to fixed-indexed annuities except that the product offers greater upside participation in the selected index as compared to a fixed-indexed annuity and replaces the guarantee of principal in a fixed-indexed annuity with a guaranteed maximum loss. AFG purchases and sells call and put options designed to substantially offset the effect of the index participation in the liabilities associated with indexed annuities.
As an accommodation in its education market, AFG offers a limited amount of variable annuities. With a variable annuity, the earnings credited to the policy vary based on the investment results of the underlying investment options chosen by the policyholder, generally without any guarantee of principal except in the case of death of the insured. Premiums directed to the underlying investment options maintained in separate accounts are invested in funds managed by various independent investment managers. AFG earns a fee on amounts deposited into separate accounts. Subject to contractual provisions, policyholders may also choose to direct all or a portion of their premiums to various fixed-rate options, in which case AFG earns a spread on amounts deposited.

The profitability of a fixed annuity business is largely dependent on the ability of a company to earn income on the assets supporting the business in excess of the amounts credited to policyholder accounts plus expenses incurred (earning a “spread”). Performance measures such as net spread earned are often presented by annuity businesses to help users of their financial statements better understand the company’s performance. The following table shows the earnings before income taxes, as well as the net spread earned on fixed annuities, for the annuity segment both before and after the impact of fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed (including variable-indexed) annuities (“FIAs”) (dollars in millions):

 | Year ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Annuity earnings before income taxes — before unlocking and change in fair value of derivatives related to FIAs | $ | 425 | | | $ | 416 | | | $ | 394

Net spread earned on fixed annuities — before impact of unlocking and derivatives related to FIAs | 1.26 | % | | 1.34 | % | | 1.38 | % 
Unlocking | (0.09 | %) | | (0.01 | %) | | 0.01 | % 
Impact of derivatives related to FIAs: | | | | | 
Change in fair value of derivatives | (0.15 | %) | | (0.22 | %) | | (0.19 | %)
Related impact on amortization of DPAC (b) | 0.05 | % | | 0.12 | % | | 0.09 | % 
Net spread earned on fixed annuities | 1.07 | % | | 1.23 | % | | 1.29 | % 


(a) | FIAs provide policyholders with a crediting rate tied, in part, to the performance of an existing stock market or other financial index. AFG attempts to mitigate the risk in the index-based component of these products through the purchase and sale of call and put options on the appropriate index. AFG’s strategy is designed so that the change in the fair value of the call option assets and put option liabilities will generally offset the economic change in the policyholder liability from the index participation. Both the index-based component of the annuities (fair value of $2.72 billion at December 31, 2018) and the related call and put options (net fair value of $183 million at December 31, 2018) are considered derivatives that must be marked-to-market through earnings each period. Fluctuations in interest rates and the stock market, among other factors, can cause volatility in the periodic measurement of fair value of the embedded derivative that management believes can be inconsistent with the long-term economics of these products.

Marketing
AFG sells its single premium annuities, excluding financial institution production (discussed below), primarily through a retail network of approximately 75 national marketing organizations (“NMOs”) and managing general agents (“MGAs”) who, in turn, direct approximately 1,600 actively producing agents.
AFG also sells single premium annuities in financial institutions through direct relationships with certain financial institutions and through independent agents and brokers. The table below highlights the percentage of AFG’s total annuity premiums generated through its top five financial institution relationships (ranked based on 2018 statutory premiums):
 | 2018 | | 2017
Wells Fargo & Company | 7.4 | % | | 8.1 | %
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. | 6.6 | % | | 9.1 | %
Regions Financial Corporation | 4.8 | % | | 6.5 | %
LPL Financial | 4.8 | % | | 5.5 | %
BB&T Corporation | 3.7 | % | | 5.5 | %

In the education market, schools may allow employees to save for retirement through contributions made on a before-tax basis. Federal income taxes are not payable on pretax contributions or earnings until amounts are withdrawn. AFG sells its education market annuities through regional and national agencies.

AFG is licensed to sell its fixed annuity products in all states except New York; it is licensed to sell its variable products in all states except New York and Vermont. At December 31, 2018, AFG had approximately 536,000 annuity policies in force. The states that accounted for 5% or more of AFG’s statutory annuity premiums in 2018 and the comparable preceding years are shown below:
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
California | 10.2 | % | | 10.0 | % | 9.8 | %
Florida | 8.1 | % | | 7.3 | % | 8.5 | %
Pennsylvania | 5.5 | % | | 6.1 | % | 7.2 | %
Ohio | 5.2 | % | | 5.4 | % | 5.2 | %
Texas | 5.1 | % | | 5.1 | % | 4.6 | %

Competition
AFG’s annuity businesses operate in highly competitive markets. They compete with other insurers and financial institutions based on many factors, including: (i) ratings; (ii) financial strength; (iii) reputation; (iv) service to policyholders and agents; (v) product design (including interest rates credited, bonus features and index participation); and (vi) commissions. Since most policies are marketed and distributed through independent agents, the insurance companies must also compete for agents.
No single insurer dominates the markets in which AFG’s annuity businesses compete. See Item 1A — Risk Factors. Competitors include (i) individual insurers and insurance groups, (ii) mutual funds and (iii) other financial institutions. In a broader sense, AFG’s annuity businesses compete for retirement savings with a variety of financial institutions offering a full range of financial services. In the financial institution annuity market, AFG’s annuities compete directly against competitors’ annuities, certificates of deposit and other investment alternatives at the point of sale. In addition, over the last few years, several offshore and/or hedge fund companies have made significant acquisitions of annuity businesses, resulting in annuity groups that are larger in size than AFG’s annuity business.
Sales of annuities, including renewal premiums, are affected by many factors, including: (i) competitive annuity products and rates; (ii) the general level and volatility of interest rates, including the slope of the yield curve; (iii) the favorable tax treatment of annuities; (iv) commissions paid to agents; (v) services offered; (vi) ratings from independent insurance rating agencies; (vii) other alternative investments; (viii) performance and volatility of the equity markets; (ix) media coverage of annuities; (x) regulatory developments regarding suitability and the sales process; and (xi) general economic conditions.
Other Operations
AFG ceased new sales of long-term care insurance in January 2010 and sold substantially all of its run-off long-term care business in December 2015. The legal entities sold in 2015, United Teacher Associates Insurance Company and Continental General Insurance Company, contained substantially all of AFG’s long-term care insurance reserves (96% as measured by net statutory reserves as of November 30, 2015), as well as smaller blocks of annuity and life insurance business. Renewal premiums on the remaining small block of long-term care policies (which are guaranteed renewable) covering approximately 1,500 lives will be accepted unless those policies lapse. At December 31, 2018, AFG’s long-term care insurance reserves were $45 million, net of reinsurance recoverables and excluding the impact of unrealized gains on securities.
Although AFG no longer actively markets new life insurance products, it continues to service and receive renewal premiums on its in-force block of approximately 97,000 policies and $10.82 billion gross ($3.13 billion net of reinsurance) of life insurance in force at December 31, 2018. Renewal premiums, net of reinsurance, were $21 million in 2018, $17 million in 2017 and $18 million in 2016. At December 31, 2018, AFG’s life insurance reserves were $292 million, net of reinsurance recoverables. 
Through subsidiaries, AFG is engaged in a variety of other operations, including commercial real estate operations in Cincinnati (office buildings), Whitefield, New Hampshire (Mountain View Grand Resort), Chesapeake Bay (Skipjack Cove Yachting Resort and Bay Bridge Marina), Charleston (Charleston Harbor Resort and Marina) and Palm Beach (Sailfish Marina and Resort). These operations employed approximately 300 full-time employees at December 31, 2018.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has retained third-party investment management firms to assist in the determination of appropriate NAIC designations for mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) based not only on the probability of loss (which is the primary basis of ratings by the major ratings firms), but also on the severity of loss and statutory carrying value. Approximately 9% of AFG’s fixed maturity investments are MBS. At December 31, 2018, 98% (based on statutory carrying value of $41.81 billion) of AFG’s fixed maturity investments held by its insurance companies had an NAIC designation of 1 or 2 (the highest of the six designations).
Regulation
AFG’s insurance company subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions where they do business. In general, the insurance laws of the various states establish regulatory agencies with broad administrative powers governing, among other things, premium rates, solvency standards, licensing of insurers, agents and brokers, trade practices, forms of policies, maintenance of specified reserves and capital for the protection of policyholders, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, investment activities and relationships between insurance subsidiaries and their parents and affiliates. Material transactions between insurance subsidiaries and their parents and affiliates generally must receive prior approval of the applicable insurance regulatory authorities and be disclosed. In addition, while differing from state to state, these regulations typically restrict the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid by an insurer to its shareholders in any twelve-month period without advance regulatory approval. Such limitations are generally based on net earnings or statutory surplus. Under applicable restrictions, the maximum amount of dividends available to AFG in 2019 from its insurance subsidiaries without seeking regulatory approval is approximately $1.30 billion.
13

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”), among other things, established a Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) within the U.S. Treasury. Under this law, regulations will need to be created for the FIO to carry out its mandate to focus on systemic risk oversight. Since its formation, the FIO has worked with the NAIC and other stakeholders to explore a hybrid approach to regulation of the insurance industry; however, the state-based system of regulation has largely been retained. AFG cannot predict the future role of the FIO and its role in regulation of the insurance industry and how that might ultimately affect AFG’s operations.
Neon, AFG’s UK-based Lloyd’s insurer, is subject to regulation by Lloyd’s, including the establishment of capital requirements and approval of business plans, and the Prudential Regulation Authority.
Most states have created insurance guaranty associations that assess solvent insurers to pay claims of insurance companies that become insolvent. Annual guaranty assessments for AFG’s insurance companies have not been material.
Disclosure of Certain Activities Under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Section 13(r)”), requires a registrant to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports whether it or an affiliate knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings related to Iran during the period covered by the report.
Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries located outside the United States subscribe to insurance policies that provide insurance coverage to vessels owned by international shipping and marine entities with vessels that travel worldwide. As a result, the insurance policies may be called upon to respond to claims involving or that have exposure to Iranian petroleum resources, refined petroleum, and petrochemical industries. For example, certain of the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries participate in global marine hull and war policies that provide coverage for damage to vessels navigating into and out of ports worldwide, which could include Iran. 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company is not aware of any additional premium with respect to underwriting insurance or reinsurance activities reportable under Section 13(r). Should any such risks have entered into the stream of commerce covered by these insurance or reinsurance activities, the Company believes that the premiums associated with such business would be immaterial.
