RPC provides a broad range of specialized oilfield services and equipment primarily to independent and major oil and gas companies engaged in the exploration, production and development of oil and gas properties throughout the United States, including the southwest, mid-continent, Gulf of Mexico, Rocky Mountain and Appalachian regions, and in selected international markets. RPC acts as a holding company for the following legal entity groupings: Cudd Energy Services, Thru Tubing Solutions and Patterson Services. Selected overhead including centralized support services and regulatory compliance are classified as Corporate. RPC is further organized into Technical Services and Support Services which are its operating segments. As of December 31, 2018, RPC had approximately 3,600 employees.
 
Business Segments
 
RPC manages its business as either services offered on the well site with equipment and personnel (Technical Services) or services and equipment offered off the well site (Support Services). The businesses under Technical Services generate revenues based on equipment, personnel operating the equipment and the materials utilized to provide the service. They are all managed, analyzed and reported based on the similarities of the operational characteristics and costs associated with providing the service. The businesses under Support Services are primarily able to generate revenues through equipment or services offered off the well site. During 2018, approximately three percent of RPC’s consolidated revenues were generated from offshore operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In 2018, we also estimate that 85 percent of our revenues were related to drilling and production activities for oil, while 15 percent of revenues were related to drilling and production activities for natural gas.
 
Technical Services include RPC’s oil and gas services that utilize people and equipment to perform value-added completion, production and maintenance services directly to a customer’s well. The demand for these services is generally influenced by customers’ decisions to invest capital toward initiating production in a new oil or natural gas well, improving production flows in an existing formation, or to address well control issues. This operating segment consists primarily of pressure pumping, downhole tools, coiled tubing, snubbing, nitrogen, well control, wireline and fishing. Customers include major multi-national and independent oil and gas producers, and selected nationally owned oil companies. The services offered under Technical Services are high capital and personnel intensive businesses. The common drivers of operational and financial success of these services include diligent equipment maintenance, strong logistical processes, and appropriately trained personnel who function well in a team environment. The Company considers all of these services to be closely integrated oil and gas well servicing businesses, and makes resource allocation and performance assessment decisions based on this operating segment as a whole across these various services. The principal markets for this business segment include the United States, including the southwest, mid-continent, Gulf of Mexico, Rocky Mountain and Appalachian regions, and selected international markets.
 
Support Services include all of the services that provide (i) equipment offered off the well site without RPC personnel and (ii) services that are provided in support of customer operations off the well site such as classroom and computer training, and other consulting services. The primary drivers of operational success for services and equipment provided off the well site without RPC personnel are offering safe, high quality and in-demand equipment appropriate for the well design characteristics. The drivers of operational success for the other Support Services relate to meeting customer needs off the well site and competitive marketing of such services. The equipment and services offered include rental tools, drill pipe and related tools, pipe handling, pipe inspection and storage services, and oilfield training and consulting services. The demand for these services tends to be influenced primarily by customer drilling-related activity levels. The principal markets for this segment include the United States, including the Gulf of Mexico, mid-continent, Rocky Mountain and Appalachian regions and project work in selected international locations in the last three years, including primarily Canada, Latin America and the Middle East. Customers primarily include domestic operations of independent oil and gas producers and major multi-nationals and selected nationally owned oil companies.
 
A brief description of the primary services conducted within each of the operating segments follows:
 
Technical Services
 
Pressure Pumping. Pressure pumping services, which accounted for 55 percent of 2018 revenues, 62 percent of 2017 revenues and 46 percent of 2016 revenues are provided to customers throughout Texas, and the mid-continent and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States. We primarily provide these services to customers in order to enhance the initial production of hydrocarbons in formations that have low permeability. Pressure pumping services involve using complex, truck or skid-mounted equipment designed and constructed for each specific pumping service offered. The mobility of this equipment permits pressure pumping services to be performed in varying geographic areas. Principal materials utilized in pressure pumping operations include fracturing proppants, acid and bulk chemical additives. Generally, these items are available from several suppliers, and the Company utilizes more than one supplier for each item. Pressure pumping services offered include:

-

 

Fracturing — Fracturing services are performed to stimulate production of oil and natural gas by increasing the permeability of a formation. Fracturing is particularly important in shale formations, which have low permeability, and unconventional completion, because the formation containing hydrocarbons is not concentrated in one area and requires multiple fracturing operations. The fracturing process consists of pumping fluid gel and sometimes nitrogen into a cased well at sufficient pressure to fracture the formation at desired locations and depths. Sand, ceramics, or synthetic materials, which are often coated with a material to increase their resistance to crushing, are pumped into the fracture. When the pressure is released at the surface, the fluid gel returns to the well surface, but the proppant remains in the fracture, thus keeping it open so that oil and natural gas can flow through the fracture into the production tubing and ultimately to the well surface. In some cases, fracturing is performed in formations with a high amount of carbonate rock by an acid solution pumped under pressure without a proppant or with small amounts of proppant.
 
Acidizing — Acidizing services are also performed to stimulate production of oil and natural gas, but they are used in wells that have undergone formation damage due to the buildup of various materials that block the formation. Acidizing entails pumping large volumes of specially formulated acids into reservoirs to dissolve barriers and enlarge crevices in the formation, thereby eliminating obstacles to the flow of oil and natural gas. Acidizing services can also enhance production in limestone formations. Acid is also frequently used in the beginning of a fracturing operation.
 
Downhole Tools. Thru Tubing Solutions (“TTS”) accounted for 25 percent of 2018 revenues, 19 percent of 2017 revenues and 23 percent of 2016 revenues. TTS provides services and proprietary downhole motors, fishing tools and other specialized downhole tools and processes to operators and service companies in drilling and production operations, including casing perforation and bridge plug drilling at the completion stage of an oil or gas well. The services that TTS provides are especially suited for unconventional drilling and completion activities. TTS’ experience providing reliable tool services allows it to work in a pressurized environment with virtually any coiled tubing unit or snubbing unit.
Coiled Tubing. Coiled tubing services, which accounted for six percent of revenues in 2018, seven percent of revenues in 2017 and 10 percent of revenues in 2016, involve the injection of coiled tubing into wells to perform various applications and functions for use principally in well-servicing operations and to facilitate completion of horizontal wells. Coiled tubing is a flexible steel pipe with a diameter of less than four inches manufactured in continuous lengths of thousands of feet and wound or coiled around a large reel. It can be inserted through existing production tubing and used to perform workovers without using a larger, costlier workover rig. Principal advantages of employing coiled tubing in a workover operation include: (i) not having to “shut-in” the well during such operations, (ii) the ability to reel continuous coiled tubing in and out of a well significantly faster than conventional pipe, (iii) the ability to direct fluids into a wellbore with more precision, and (iv) enhanced access to remote or offshore fields due to the smaller size and mobility of a coiled tubing unit compared to a workover rig. Increasingly, coiled tubing units are also used to support completion activities in directional and horizontal wells. Such completion activities usually require multiple entrances in a wellbore in order to complete multiple fractures during a pressure pumping operation. A coiled tubing unit can accomplish this type of operation because its flexibility allows it to be steered in a direction other than vertical, which is necessary in this type of wellbore. At the same time, the strength of the coiled tubing string allows various types of tools or motors to be conveyed into the well effectively. The uses for coiled tubing in directional and horizontal wells have been enhanced by improved fabrication techniques and higher-diameter coiled tubing which allows coiled tubing units to be used effectively over greater distances, thus allowing them to function in more of the completion activities currently taking place in the U.S. domestic market. There are several manufacturers of flexible steel pipe used in coiled tubing services, and the Company believes that its sources of supply are adequate.
Snubbing. Snubbing (also referred to as hydraulic workover services), which accounted for one percent of revenues in 2018, two percent of revenues in 2017 and three percent of revenues in 2016, involves using a hydraulic workover rig that permits an operator to repair damaged casing, production tubing and downhole production equipment in a high-pressure environment. A snubbing unit makes it possible to remove and replace downhole equipment while maintaining pressure on the well. Customers benefit because these operations can be performed without removing the pressure from the well, which stops production and can damage the formation, and because a snubbing unit can perform many applications at a lower cost than other alternatives. Because this service involves a very hazardous process that entails high risk, the snubbing segment of the oil and gas services industry is limited to a relative few operators who have the experience and knowledge required to perform such services safely and efficiently. Increasingly, snubbing units are used for unconventional completions at the outer reaches of long wellbores which cannot be serviced by coiled tubing because coiled tubing has a more limited range than drill pipe conveyed by a snubbing unit.

-

Nitrogen. Nitrogen accounted for three percent of revenues in 2018, two percent of revenues in 2017 and five percent of revenues in 2016. There are a number of uses for nitrogen, an inert, non-combustible element, in providing services to oilfield customers and industrial users outside of the oilfield. For our oilfield customers, nitrogen can be used to clean drilling and production pipe and displace fluids in various drilling applications. Increasingly, it is used as a displacement medium to increase production in older wells in which production has depleted. It also can be used to create a fire-retardant environment in hazardous blowout situations and as a fracturing medium for our fracturing service. In addition, nitrogen can be complementary to our snubbing and coiled tubing services, because it is a non-corrosive medium and is frequently injected into a well using coiled tubing. Nitrogen is complementary to our pressure pumping service as well, because foam-based nitrogen stimulation is appropriate in certain sensitive formations in which the fluids used in fracturing or acidizing would damage a customer's well.
 
For non-oilfield industrial users, nitrogen can be used to purge pipelines and create a non-combustible environment. RPC stores and transports nitrogen and has a number of pumping unit configurations that inject nitrogen in its various applications. Some of these pumping units are set up for use on offshore platforms or inland waters. RPC purchases its nitrogen in liquid form from several suppliers and believes that these sources of supply are adequate.
 
Well Control. Cudd Energy Services specializes in responding to and controlling oil and gas well emergencies, including blowouts and well fires, domestically and internationally. In connection with these services, Cudd Energy Services, along with Patterson Services, has the capacity to supply the equipment, expertise and personnel necessary to restore affected oil and gas wells to production. During the past several years, the Company has responded to numerous well control situations in the domestic U.S. oilfield and in various international locations.
 
The Company’s professional firefighting staff has many years of aggregate industry experience in responding to well fires and blowouts. This team of experts responds to well control situations where hydrocarbons are escaping from a wellbore, regardless of whether a fire has occurred. In the most critical situations, there are explosive fires, the destruction of drilling and production facilities, substantial environmental damage and the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars per day in well operators’ production revenue. Since these events ordinarily arise from equipment failures or human error, it is impossible to predict accurately the timing or scope of this work. Additionally, less critical events frequently occur in connection with the drilling of new wells in high-pressure reservoirs. In these situations, the Company is called upon to supervise and assist in the well control effort so that drilling operations can resume as promptly as safety permits.
 
Wireline Services. Wireline is classified into two types of services: slick or braided line and electric line. In both, a spooled wire is unwound and lowered into a well, conveying various types of tools or equipment. Slick or braided line services use a non-conductive line primarily for jarring objects into or out of a well, as in fishing or plug-setting operations. Electric line services lower an electrical conductor line into a well allowing the use of electrically-operated tools such as perforators, bridge plugs and logging tools. Wireline services can be an integral part of the plug and abandonment process near the end of the life cycle of a well.
Pump Down Services. Pump down services are an integral part of the well completion process and are critical in multiple-stage, unconventional well completions which use various types of bridge plugs and perforation techniques. Pump down services use fluids and low-capacity pressure pumping equipment, and work in coordination with wireline services, to place completion equipment at the desired location in a well bore. This process is repeated for each stage, moving from the most distant end of the wellbore to the end that is closest to the wellhead.
Fishing. Fishing involves the use of specialized tools and procedures to retrieve lost equipment from a well drilling operation and producing wells. It is a service required by oil and gas operators who have lost equipment in a well. Oil and natural gas production from an affected well typically declines until the lost equipment can be retrieved. In some cases, the Company creates customized tools to perform a fishing operation. The customized tools are maintained by the Company after the particular fishing job for future use if a similar need arises.
Support Services
 
Rental Tools. Rental tools accounted for three percent of revenues in 2018, two percent of revenues in 2017 and three percent of revenues in 2016. The Company rents specialized equipment for use with onshore and offshore oil and gas well drilling, completion and workover activities. The drilling and subsequent operation of oil and gas wells generally require a variety of equipment. The equipment needed is in large part determined by the geological features of the production zone and the size of the well itself. As a result, operators and drilling contractors often find it more economical to supplement their tool and tubular assets with rental items instead of owning a complete set of assets. The Company’s facilities are strategically located to serve the major staging points for oil and gas activities in Texas, the Gulf of Mexico, mid-continent region, Appalachian region and the Rocky Mountains.

Industry 
 
United States. RPC provides its services to its domestic customers through a network of facilities strategically located to serve oil and gas drilling and production activities of its customers in Texas, the Gulf of Mexico, the mid-continent, the southwest, the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian regions. Demand for RPC’s services in the U.S. tends to be extremely volatile and fluctuates with current and projected price levels of oil and natural gas and activity levels in the oil and gas industry. Customer activity levels are influenced by their decisions about capital investment toward the development and production of oil and gas reserves.
 
Due to aging oilfields and lower-cost sources of oil internationally, the drilling rig count in the U.S. has declined by approximately 77 percent from its peak in 1981. However, due to continuously enhanced rig and other technologies, more wells are drilled during periods of strong industry activity, and these wells are increasingly productive. For these reasons, the domestic production of natural gas rose to record levels in the third quarter of 2015, and domestic production of crude oil in the third quarter of 2015 reached its highest level since the third quarter of 1971. With the decline in domestic drilling and completion activities beginning in early 2015, domestic production of both natural gas and oil began to decline during the third and fourth quarters of 2015, although production continues to remain high in comparison to historical levels. Oil and gas industry activity levels have historically been volatile, experiencing multiple cycles, including six down cycle troughs between 1981 and 2016, with May 2016 marking the lowest U.S. domestic rig count in U.S. oilfield history. The rig count during the peak of the most recent cycle occurred at the end of the third quarter of 2014, and began to decline sharply during the fourth quarter of 2014. The rig count continued to decline in 2015 and 2016, until June of 2016 when it stabilized and began to increase. Early in 2019, the rig count had recovered by approximately 159 percent from the historical low set during the second quarter of 2016, but was still approximately 46 percent lower than the cyclical peak in the third quarter of 2014.

Because of the increased efficiency of drilling rigs, the Company also monitors well completions in the U.S. domestic oilfield. Well completions are particularly important to RPC because the majority of its services are utilized during the completion stage of an oil or gas well’s life cycle, so they are an important indicator of the demand for RPC’s services. As reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration during the first quarter of 2019, annual well completions fell from a cyclical peak of 21,370 in 2014 to 8,106 in 2016. Between 2016 and 2018, annual well completions increased by 6,456 or 79.7 percent. In spite of the increase in well completions during the past two years, annual well completions in 2018 were 31.9 percent lower than the 2014 cyclical peak.
 
The fluctuations in domestic drilling activity since the third quarter of 2014 peak are consistent with global supply of and demand for oil, the domestic supply of and demand for natural gas, U.S. domestic storage levels of oil and natural gas, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar on world currency markets, and projected near-term economic growth. During 2015 and into the first quarter of 2016, the price of oil fell by approximately 78 percent from the cyclical peak in the third quarter of 2014. From its low price in early 2016, the price of oil had risen approximately 155 percent to its recent cyclical peak early in the fourth quarter of 2018. Between this cyclical peak and early in the first quarter of 2019, the price of oil fell by approximately 28 percent. RPC believes that the increase in the price of oil between 2016 and 2018 was due to increasing global demand and a perceived moderation of global supply, and that the recent decline in the price of oil was due to a change in sentiment regarding supply and demand. The average price of natural gas increased by approximately 6.4 percent during 2018 as compared with 2017 and early in the first quarter of 2019, the price of natural gas was approximately 18 percent lower than the price at the end of 2018. RPC does not believe that the current price of natural gas is sufficient to encourage natural gas-directed drilling, and we note that many oil-directed wells produce a great deal of natural gas and natural gas liquids as well. In addition to oil and natural gas, the price of natural gas liquids plays a minor role in determining our customers’ activity levels, since it is produced in many of the shale resource plays which also produce oil, and production of various natural gas liquids has increased to a level comparable to that of natural gas. During 2018 the average price of natural gas liquids increased by approximately 15 percent compared with 2017. Early in the first quarter of 2019, the price of natural gas liquids increased by approximately 29 percent compared to the average price in 2018. During 2018, the price of oil was high enough to encourage increased drilling and production activity, but the unexpected and significant drop in the price of oil during the fourth quarter of 2018 has caused many of RPC’s customers to delay or curtail their drilling and completion plans for the near term. The fluctuations in the prices of these commodities, and in particular, the extreme volatility in the price of oil, significantly impact RPC’s financial results.
 
From 2001 to 2009, gas drilling rigs represented over 80 percent of the drilling rig count. In 2010, the percentage of drilling rigs drilling for natural gas began to decline, and by early in the first quarter of 2015 had fallen to approximately 18 percent of total drilling activity. In absolute terms, the natural gas drilling rig count in the third quarter of 2016 was the lowest natural gas drilling rig count ever recorded. During 2018 and early into the first quarter of 2019, the natural gas drilling rig count as a percentage of the total rig count remained steady at approximately 18 percent of total drilling. Although the demand for natural gas has remained stable, the price of natural gas has fallen in recent years due to increased domestic reserves, productivity of new wells, and high associated natural gas production from oil-directed wells. In spite of these unfavorable near-term dynamics, the long-term demand outlook for natural gas is still favorable because, unlike oil, foreign imports of natural gas do not compete with domestic production to a meaningful degree, and for several years, the United States has exported increasing volumes of natural gas to other countries. We anticipate that oil-directed drilling will continue to represent the majority of the total drilling rig count during the near term. Over the long term, we believe that natural gas-directed drilling will increase due to the lack of natural gas production from oil-directed drilling and increased natural gas demand from U.S. exports of natural gas in addition to changes in demand due to increased use of natural gas as a transportation fuel or for other purposes. We continue to believe in the long-term growth opportunities for our business due to the continued high demand for hydrocarbons generally and the growing production of oil in the domestic U.S. market in particular. Furthermore, we note that the techniques used to extract oil and natural gas in the U.S. domestic market increasingly require the types of services that RPC provides to its customers.
 
Unconventional wells generate a higher demand for RPC’s services because they are difficult and costly to complete. They comprise the majority of U.S. domestic drilling and during the fourth quarter of 2018 and early in the first quarter of 2019, have reached a historical high of approximately 94 percent of total drilling. Because they are drilled through a typically narrow and relatively impermeable formation such as shale, they require additional stimulation when they are completed. Also, many of these formations require high pumping rates of stimulation fluids under high pressures, which in turn require a great deal of pressure pumping horsepower on location to complete the well. Furthermore, since they are not drilled in a straight vertical direction from the Earth’s surface, they require tools and drilling mechanisms that are flexible, rather than rigid, and can be steered once they are downhole. Specifically, these types of wells require RPC’s pressure pumping and coiled tubing services, as well as our downhole tools and services.

International.  RPC has historically operated in several countries outside of the United States, and international revenues accounted for five percent of RPC’s consolidated revenues in 2018, four percent in 2017 and seven percent in 2016. RPC’s allocation of growth capital over the last several years have emphasized domestic rather than international expansion because of higher domestic activity levels and expected financial returns. International revenues increased 61.9 percent in 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher customer activity levels in Argentina and to a lesser extent, Mexico and Pakistan, partially offset by lower activity in Gabon. During 2018, RPC provided downhole motors and tools in Argentina, Canada, Mexico and Oman, as well as rental tools in Pakistan. We also provided snubbing services in Gabon. We continue to focus on the selected development of international opportunities in these and other markets, although we believe that it will continue to be less than ten percent of total revenues in 2019.
 
RPC provides services to its international customers through branch locations or wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. The international market is prone to political uncertainties, including the risk of civil unrest and conflicts. However, due to the significant investment requirement and complexity of international projects, customers’ drilling decisions relating to such projects tend to be evaluated and monitored with a longer-term perspective with regard to oil and natural gas pricing, and therefore have the potential to be more stable than most U.S. domestic operations. Additionally, the international market is dominated by major oil companies and national oil companies which tend to have different objectives and more operating stability than the typical independent oil and gas producer in the U.S. Predicting the timing and duration of contract work is not possible. Refer to Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our international operations.
 
Growth Strategies
 
RPC’s primary objective is to generate excellent long-term returns on investment through the effective and conservative management of its invested capital to generate strong cash flow. This objective continues to be pursued through strategic investments and opportunities designed to enhance the long-term value of RPC while improving market share, product offerings and the profitability of existing businesses. Growth strategies are focused on selected customers and markets in which we believe there exist opportunities for higher growth, customer and market penetration, or enhanced returns achieved through consolidations or through providing proprietary value-added equipment and services. RPC intends to focus on specific market segments in which it believes that it has a competitive advantage and on potential large customers who have a long-term need for our services in markets in which we operate.
 
RPC seeks to expand its service capabilities through a combination of internal growth, acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances. Historically, we have found that we generate higher financial returns from organic growth with our services and geographical locations in which we have experience. Because of the fragmented nature of the oil and gas services industry, RPC believes a number of acquisition opportunities exist, and we frequently consider such opportunities. We have consummated relatively few acquisitions, however, due to high seller valuation expectations and the risk of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations. We will continue to consider the acquisitions of existing businesses but will also continue to maintain a conservative capital structure, which may limit our ability to consummate large transactions.
 
RPC has a revolving credit facility which can be used to fund working capital requirements. The borrowing base for this credit facility is $125 million less the amount of any outstanding letters of credit. There was no outstanding balance on this credit facility as of December 31, 2018. Our capital structure is more conservative than that of many of our peers.
 
Customers 
 
Demand for RPC’s services and equipment depends primarily upon the number of oil and natural gas wells being drilled, the depth and drilling conditions of such wells, the number of well completions and the level of production enhancement activity worldwide. RPC’s principal customers consist of major and independent oil and natural gas producing companies. During 2018, RPC provided oilfield services to several hundred customers. Of these customers, there was no customer in 2018 or 2017 that accounted for more than 10 percent of revenues.
 
Sales are generated by RPC’s sales force and through referrals from existing customers. We monitor closely the financial condition of these customers, their capital expenditure plans, and other indications of their drilling and completion activities. Due to the short lead time between ordering services or equipment and providing services or delivering equipment, there is no significant sales backlog.

Competition 
 
RPC operates in highly competitive areas of the oilfield services industry. We sell our equipment and services in highly competitive markets, and the revenues and earnings generated are affected by changes in prices for our services, fluctuations in the level of customer activity in major markets, general economic conditions and governmental regulation. RPC competes with many large and small oilfield industry competitors, including the largest integrated oilfield services companies. During the oilfield downturn of 2015 and 2016, a number of smaller oilfield services companies as well as several of our publicly traded peers reduced the scope of their operations or became insolvent. During 2017, however, an improving industry environment and the positive outlook on the industry from the financial markets facilitated the formation of new companies and allowed existing companies to expand their operations. RPC believes that these expanded or newly formed companies increased competitive pressures during the near term, since they began to provide services to our existing customers at lower prices, and hired experienced personnel from more established companies such as RPC. Pricing for our services improved significantly during 2017, but began to decline during the fourth quarter of 2017 and throughout 2018. RPC believes that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that it serves are product availability and quality of our equipment and raw materials used to provide our services, service quality, reputation for safety and technical proficiency, and price.
 
The oil and gas services industry includes dominant global competitors including, among others, Halliburton Energy Services Group, a division of Halliburton Company, Baker Hughes, a GE Company, and Schlumberger Ltd. The industry also includes a number of other publicly traded peers whose operations are more similar to RPC, including Basic Energy Services, C&J Energy Services, Keane Group, Inc., Liberty Oilfield Services, Mammoth Energy Services, Inc., NCS Multistage Holdings, Inc., Nine Energy Service, Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., ProPetro Holding Corporation and Superior Energy Services, as well as numerous smaller, locally owned competitors.
 
Facilities/Equipment
 
RPC’s equipment consists primarily of oil and gas services equipment used either in servicing customer wells or provided on a rental basis for customer use. Substantially all of this equipment is Company owned. RPC purchases oilfield service equipment from a limited number of manufacturers. These manufacturers may not be able to meet our requests for timely delivery during periods of high demand which may result in delayed deliveries of equipment and higher prices for equipment.
 
RPC owns and leases regional and district facilities from which its oilfield services are provided to land-based and offshore customers. RPC’s principal executive offices in Atlanta, Georgia are leased. The Company has two primary administrative buildings, one leased facility in The Woodlands, Texas that includes the Company’s operations, engineering, sales and marketing headquarters, and one owned facility in Houma, Louisiana that includes certain administrative functions. RPC believes that its facilities are adequate for its current operations. For additional information with respect to RPC’s lease commitments, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
RPC’s business is affected by state, federal and foreign laws and other regulations relating to the oil and gas industry, as well as laws and regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection. RPC cannot predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations or how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings, whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted, or the effect such changes may have on it, its businesses or financial condition.
 
In addition, our customers are affected by laws and regulations relating to the exploration and production of natural resources such as oil and natural gas. These regulations are subject to change, and new regulations may curtail or eliminate our customers’ activities. We cannot determine the extent to which new legislation may impact our customers’ activity levels, and ultimately, the demand for our services.
 
Intellectual Property
 
RPC uses several patented items in its operations which management believes are important, but are not indispensable, to RPC’s success. Although RPC anticipates seeking patent protection when possible, it relies to a greater extent on the technical expertise and know-how of its personnel to maintain its competitive position.
