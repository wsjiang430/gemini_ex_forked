Our Corporate History and Background
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 7, 2008. From inception through December 31, 2014, our primary business purpose was to stockpile indium, a specialty metal that is used as a raw material in a wide variety of consumer electronics manufacturing applications. As of December 31, 2014, we sold all of the indium from our stockpile. As a result, at such time we were no longer in the business of purchasing and selling indium. In 2015, our Board of Directors approved a cash distribution to our stockholders and a share repurchase program. After completion of the cash distribution and the share repurchase program the Company sought a new growth platform and focused on acquiring an operating business.
Oilfield Services Focus
 
On September 19, 2017, we completed our initial acquisition and acquired one hundred percent of the issued and outstanding membership interests (“MG Membership Interests”) of MG Cleaners LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“MG”) pursuant to which MG became our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “MG Acquisition”). In connection with the MG Acquisition, we issued 4,578,276 shares and agreed to pay $300,000 in cash to the MG Members, payable with $250,000 at closing and the remaining $50,000 paid to the MG Members upon the completion of the Company’s sale of a minimum of $500,000 of its securities in a private offering to investors.
 
Effective April 2, 2018, we changed our corporate name to SMG Industries Inc. to reflect our new business focus.
 
On September 27, 2018, we acquired more than 800 downhole oil tools which include stabilizers, crossovers, drilling jars, roller reamers and bit subs, including both non-mag and steel units in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of one million (1,000,000) shares of our common stock to the sellers. (should we discuss value recorded for this deal?)
 
On December 7, 2018, we acquired one hundred percent of the issued and outstanding membership interests (“MWTS Membership Interests”) of Momentum Water Transfer Services LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“MWTS”) pursuant to which MWTS became our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “MWTS Acquisition”). In connection with the MWTS Acquisition, we issued 550,000 shares of our common stock, paid $361,710 in cash to the MWTS Members and issued a note payable to the MWTS Member in the aggregate amount of $800,000. Principal and interest on the note shall be repaid in sixty (60) equal monthly payments of $7,500 (“Installment Payments”) and a final balloon payment for the remaining principal and accrued interest due on the maturity date. The note bears interest at a rate of 6% per annum.
 
Industry Overview
 
In March 2019, the Domestic United States Rig Count, as measured by Baker Hughes, stood at 1,027, up 154% from the May 2016 lows of 404. Rig Counts are a measurement of oilfield activity particularly relevant to the drilling market segment, as we sell products to drilling rig operator customers. As a result of relatively favorable operating economics for oil and gas companies, there is a high concentration of rigs and oilfield activity in Texas compared to other areas in the domestic United States. In March 2019 Texas and adjacent New Mexico (Permian and Delaware basins) had approximately 610 rigs operating, representing about 65% of the entire domestic United States rigs concentrated in these West Texas/New Mexico basins.

The Completions (or fracing) market segment was 18,500 wells in 2018 according to Westwood Global Energy. According to the Texas Railroad Commission 10,986 wells were completed in Texas in 2018. World Oil estimates that well completion in Texas will be approximately 12,301 in 2019. Drilled uncompleted wells, referred to as DUCs or ‘fraclog’, domestically was at an all-time high of 8,576 wells as of February, 2019 in the domestic United States according to EIA.
 
According to a 2018 MarketsandMarkets report, the Oilfield Services Market was valued at $103.26 Billion in 2017 and is expected to grow globally at a CAGR of 3.35% through 2022. Increases in oil and gas exploration, exploring new oilfield reserves, shale gas exploration are major driving forces to the increase in activities to the oilfield services market.
 
MG Cleaners Products and Services
 
Proprietary Products
 
Our branded products have proprietary formulations that perform in specific applications. These products include surfactants and degreasers which are environmentally friendly and sold primarily to drilling rig operators, exploration and production companies, and distribution and supply companies serving this market segment.
 
Our branded products have proprietary formulations that have been sold direct via our sales force and through distribution supply companies for over ten years. Miracle Blue®, a powerful degreaser, Luma Brite™, an aluminum brightener and descaler, and Wicked Green®, an enviro-friendly emulsifier used in oil remediation jobs that is bio-degradable, are some of the Company’s top selling products. In total, we currently offer 14 branded and proprietary products used by industry leading drilling contractors in the domestic United States including Nabors, Patterson-UTI, Helmrich & Payne and Cactus Drilling among others. MG’s products are sold throughout Texas using direct sales employees in the East Texas market (based in Carthage, Texas) and in the West Texas market (based in Odessa, Texas) with distributors/suppliers handling other areas.
 
Service Crews
 
MG’s service crews consist of Company employees who perform drilling rig wash and mechanical repair services for drilling rig operator customers. MG’s rig wash crews typically consist of four employees using company equipment that clean a drilling rig prior to its transport to another location. Mechanic crews generate service revenues by performing onsite repairs of centrifugal pumps, mud agitators and related equipment. MG’s mechanic service crews also operate at MG’s East and West Texas facilities for non-time critical jobs.
 
In other examples, customers prefer to outsource cleaning and repair services where our service crews become strategic to MG’s business solving customer problems and using our products during service.
 
Equipment and Parts Sales
 
Other customers prefer to purchase equipment and perform their own maintenance on their equipment, using a variety of our cleaning products. Through long-standing relationships with manufacturers, we sell equipment and related parts to our customers which strategically promote our future product sales. We currently offer a full line of industrial and oilfield pressure washers along with compressors, heaters, water pumps and combination units. We also sell spare parts to customers who have purchased equipment, which include pressure washer water guns, hoses and fittings.
Rentals
 
Some drilling rig operators, oil company operators and other oilfield companies rent our rig wash equipment trailer units that are comprised of pressure washers, heating equipment, water containment units and related components. These rental revenues typically come in five to seven day rental cycles, and MG charges a day rate for this equipment.
SMG Oil Tools – Rentals
 
SMG Oil Tools has an inventory of more than 800 downhole oil tools which include stabilizers, crossovers, drilling jars, roller reamers and bit subs both non-mag and steel units. These tools are available, on a rental basis to drilling contractors and operators who do not own these tools but outsource to service companies. These tools can be rented on a day to day basis to a month to month basis.

In February 2019, we entered into an exclusive rental agreement with Christopher Equipment and Rentals, LLC ("CER") of Odessa, Texas. Under the terms of the agreement, SMGI contributed more than 800 down hole oil tools which include steel and non-mag stabilizers, roller reamers, collars, bit subs and crossovers to CER for its exclusive use to rent these bottom hole assembly (BHA) tools to directional drillers and other oilfield customers in the Permian Basin. Pursuant to the agreement, an additional 400 similar oil tools were contributed to CER from an affiliate business to CER to create a broad offering of down hole rental fleet for customers to use in their unconventional drilling applications. As a marketing and rental partner to us, CER will manage all aspects of the down hole tool business including sourcing customers, delivering rental oil tools, repair and customer service. Pursuant to this agreement, CER will pay a royalty on rental revenues to the Company in the amount of eleven percent of its net sales once payment is received. The agreement is for three years, with permission-based extensions possible, and requires CER to make minimum royalties payments to the Company to preserve the agreement's exclusivity.
 
Momentum Water Transfer Services – Frac Water Services
 
Momentum Water Transfer Services provides high volume water transfer services to frac sites, on behalf of oil and gas operators, utilizing its above ground temporary infrastructure including miles of lay flat no leak frac hose, high volume pumps and equipment. Oil and gas companies typically rent this equipment as a service to send water from a source such as a river, lake or frac pond to the well site for fracing. According to EIA, a typical frac in the areas we provide water transfer services to could require 4.4 million gallons of water during the drilling of the well. Separate pressure pumping service companies typically arrange for the sand and perform the frac, while water transfer companies such as ours, are typically hired by an oil and gas operator to send frac water to the pressure pumping service company performing the frac.
Our Strategies
 
Buy and Build. Our strategy involves growth resulting from making acquisitions of private owner/operated lower or middle-market size oilfield services companies operating in the Southwest United States with a plan to grow them post-acquisition. Our management team seeks to identify companies that have good reputations, customers and complementary service lines. We plan for additional growth post-acquisition of these targets by identifying business constraints which can be removed once acquired by us. These business constraints typically can be a lack of equipment, working capital, systems, sales force or management. Our strategy is to seek target companies that, once acquired, can grow substantially from removing those constraints. We believe growth rates can be enhanced by both the acquisition of revenue generating companies and the subsequent growth post-acquisition. This strategy differs in management’s view from a “roll up” as we do not look to make acquisitions just for cost saving synergies from elimination of duplicate personnel etc., but rather by adding personnel, capital and customers for growth _Our first acquisition, MG Cleaners illustrates this strategy as its revenues have almost doubled since September 2017 by adding equipment, systems and working capital.
Cross-sell Customer Bases of Acquired Oilfield Service Companies. We currently have over 50 customers, many of which are leading companies in their respective areas. Our strategy of cross-selling customer bases of acquired companies allows us to enhance our service offerings and our relationships with our customers by bringing other products and services to them that we develop or acquire when there is a demand. As an example, on December 7, 2018, we acquired a frac water transfer company that brought customers that were active in the Eagle Ford Shale area of South Texas allowing us to introduce MG Cleaners products and services to those customers without the challenge of procuring new Master Service Agreements (MSAs), and without incurring the typical sales and marketing expenses associated with soliciting and securing new customers.
Broaden Service Offerings Across the Market Segments of Drilling, Completions and Production. We currently believe that our strategy of developing, adding or acquiring lines of service for other market segments such as fracing with Completions and well site services for Production applications will assist us in diversifying our business and provide a more enhanced services offering for customers seeking to reduce vendor lists. Our initial acquisition of MG Cleaners focusing in the Drilling segment benefitted when we acquired a frac water company focusing in the Completions segment. Currently, our strategy is to increasingly expand services across these market segments on behalf of our customers.
Geographic and Unconventional Resource Focus. Currently, more than half of the rigs in the domestic United States are located in Texas and adjacent counties within New Mexico and Louisiana. Due to relatively favorable economics in these resource plays. our strategy of geographic focus allows us to address this significant portion of the domestic United States market with a few facilities and offices strategically located in Houston, Odessa, Carthage and Alice, Texas. This strategy permits us to avoid the additional expense of managing operations in other areas of the US such as North Dakota or New England. Our strategy of focusing on unconventional resource plays in this geographic area generates service activities in Haynesville shale, Eagle Ford shale, Permian and Delaware Basins. According to EIA, 90% of the oilfield activity in the domestic United States is for unconventional resources such as shale plays.
Sales. The Company’s sales plan includes continuing to support its East Texas direct sales presence and establishing a direct sales force in West Texas to complement the distribution and supply channels already present in that area. This will be led by a recently hired strategic employee who has a significant number of customer and sales contacts. We also have meaningful sales through distributors and supply firms that benefit from their customers’ requests for our products. Any demand for the Company’s products outside the state of Texas are typically fulfilled through a distribution supply channel.

Manufacturing. MG manufacturers its products in its facility in Carthage, Texas. Raw materials are procured by the Company and the proprietary formulas for our brands are utilized throughout the process. Mixing tanks and other process equipment are used to make the products. The final product is then stored in large gravity-fed containers onsite or in transportation quantities such as totes or gallons. Third party shipping and distribution companies are currently utilized for certain shipments of product to West Texas. We may install manufacturing capabilities in our Odessa, Texas facility as activity increases in that market area.
Marketing Plan. The Company’s marketing plan focuses around supporting its product brands such as Miracle Blue®, Luma Brite™, and Wicked Green® as well as supporting its direct sales force. MG participates in industry trade shows, sponsorships and community events that allow its products to be featured. Social media, including LinkedIn, is utilized to facilitate awareness and discussion groups focused around these product cleaning applications. The Company’s web site has been updated recently to create higher relevance for our target market customers and promote testimonials of our products and equipment. For our service crews, the marketing plan is to increase crew counts in West Texas market area so as to increase availability and service hours.
Market Segment Description. The Company views the oilfield services market in three principal segments: Drilling, Completions and Production. MG’s position in the market is to focus on the Drilling segment. In our opinion, the Drilling market is very elastic resulting in its segment being the first to recover on industry up-cycles.
Market Activity. In any given unconventional well typically drilled in Texas, the completion and fracturing costs can be two to three times the cost of drilling. Therefore, a trend has developed over recent years referred to as "fraclog”, illustrating the number of Drilled Uncompleted Wells (DUCs). According to the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA), DUC’s total 8,576 in the domestic US, in February 2019. As industry economics improve, the Company believes that the Completions market segment could become more attractive. Today, however, MG believes the Drilling market segment is where we should focus our resources and attention. The Production market segment has been relatively steady, compared to Drilling and Completion, as wells already online which are maintaining positive economics can support operations and continued production.
 
The Company currently believes the price of oil and gas may stay at present levels for several years therefore, we believe our focus and positioning on the drilling market segment is critical to the Company’s future profitability.
 
Management. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Flemming, is located in Houston, Texas. Mr. Flemming has experience in acquisitions, management, capital raises and public company environments. He was previously a CEO of HII Technologies (“HII”) when it was a small public company with approximately $300,000 in cash, no debt and plans to enter the oilfield services business through an initial platform acquisition. HII had no revenues prior to its first acquisition in September 2012, when it acquired AES Water Solutions for approximately $2.3 million in cash, a seller note and stock. Following this initial acquisition, HII completed two more acquisitions as well as starting up two additional subsidiaries in the power and safety markets of the oilfield service business. By December 2014, HII’s consolidated revenues had grown to $4.2 million for that month (or an annual run rate of revenues of approximately $50 million). Falling rig counts, industry activity and oil & gas prices created an industry down-turn by 2015. In July 2015, HII’s senior lender declared HII in default of its senior credit facility, and as a result the lender did not continue to release funds to HII pursuant to the terms of the credit facility. As a result, HII was unable to continue to fund its operations or satisfy its reporting obligations with the SEC subsequent to its March 31, 2015 Form 10-Q filing. Led by a Chief Restructuring Officer, HII filed a voluntary Chapter 11 petition with the US Bankruptcy court in Houston, Texas in September 2015. On April 15, 2016, Mr. Flemming resigned as an officer and director of HII as it emerged from bankruptcy protection. On July 13, 2016, HII’s registration was revoked by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The revocation of HII’s registration was the result of proceedings instituted by the SEC, which HII accepted and consented to without admitting or denying the findings of the SEC. The SEC’s findings included that HII filed a Chapter 11 petition with the Bankruptcy court and that HII failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
 
Mr. Flemming has been a CEO and CFO for more than twenty years in high growth capital intensive businesses with more than twelve years’ experience as an officer in a public company environment. He has significant experience with our Buy and Build strategy, identifying target oilfield companies and relationships in the oilfield market place that help provide access to products and company acquisition targets.
 
Stephen Christian has been our EVP and head of operations since April 2018. Mr. Christian has served as President of MG Cleaners, LLC since October 2010, when he acquired MG Cleaners’ membership interests and continues to have operational responsibility for MG, our wholly-owned subsidiary. Prior to MG, Stephen was employed by the largest drilling rig operator in the United States, known as Nabors Drilling, a subsidiary of Nabors Industries (NYSE:NBR), as a Rig Manager from 2004 to 2010. Over the six years he was employed by Nabors, Mr. Christian developed a strong reputation with Nabors’ employees and industry partners. He purchased MG Cleaners in 2010 and has operated the business as its President since its acquisition. The Company believes Mr. Christian’s operations experience, industry relationships and reputation will continue to assist us in our growth.

Geographic Operations
 
Our headquarters are in Houston, Texas and our facilities are strategically located including Odessa, Texas for the Permian Basin (which includes the Midland and Delaware sub-Basins), Carthage, Texas for Haynesville and Cotton Valley plays, and Alice, Texas addressing the Eagle Ford Shale and Austin Chalk activity. All of our products are made in Texas. Any products sold outside of our current geographic focus is handled by distribution partners and currently represents an immaterial percentage of our sales.
Competition
 
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We provide services and sell our products in the southwest United States. Our competitors include many large and small oilfield service companies. In addition, the business segments in which we compete are highly fragmented. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets we serve are: reputation for service and technical expertise, equipment and personnel capacity, work force competency, efficiency, safety record and price. Our branded products compete against other cleaning products, surfactants and degreasers, some of which are branded retail and some industrial. Because of our dealer status with certain equipment, we do not frequently compete for equipment sales on selected items in our geographic areas. With our service crews, we compete with the human resources that drilling rig operators and oil companies employ. These firms may have their own service personnel, in which case we may not get awarded that service job. While we seek to be competitive in our pricing, we believe many of our customers elect to work with us based on safety, performance and quality of our crews, equipment and services. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by delivering the highest quality service, experienced personnel and equipment possible, coupled with execution and operating efficiency in a safe working environment. Many of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources than we do.
Cyclical Nature of Industry
 
We operate in a highly cyclical industry. The key factor driving demand for our services is the level of drilling activity by E&P companies, which in turn depends largely on current and anticipated future crude oil and natural gas prices and production depletion rates. Global supply and demand for oil and the domestic supply and demand for natural gas are critical in assessing industry outlook. Demand for oil and natural gas is cyclical and subject to large, rapid fluctuations. Producers tend to increase capital expenditures in response to increases in oil and natural gas prices, which generally results in greater revenues and profits for oilfield service companies such as ours. Increased capital expenditures also ultimately lead to greater production, which historically has resulted in increased supplies and reduced prices, which in turn tend to reduce activity levels for oilfield services. For these reasons, the results of our operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year. These fluctuations may distort comparisons of results across periods.
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
 
The Company serves several major drilling companies and independent oil & gas companies that are active in our core areas of operations.
 
As of December 31, 2018, three customers comprised more than 10% of our accounts receivable balance at approximately 22%, 18% and 11%, respectively. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018, two customers represented more than 10% of our revenues at 31% and 19%, respectively, and no other customer represented more than 10% of our revenues during this period
 
As of December 31, 2017, two customers comprised more than 10% of our accounts receivable balance at approximately 44% and 20%, respectively. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, two customers represented more than 10% of our revenues at 34% and 18%, respectively, and no other customer represented more than 10% of our revenues during this period.
 
Seasonality
 
Weather conditions affect the demand for, and prices of, oil and natural gas and, as a result, demand for our services. Demand for oil and natural gas is typically higher in the fourth and first quarters resulting in higher prices. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that may be realized on an annual basis.
Raw Materials
 
The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials, parts and components that are made by other manufacturers and suppliers for our use. The Company is not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies or materials and we believe that such parts, supplies and materials are readily available from multiple sources. We do not foresee significant price fluctuations in our raw material costs.

Intellectual Property
 
We do not have any patents on our current products and do not intend to file any patents on such products. We protect our trademarks and may from time to time file for registration of those trademarks.
 
We currently protect our trade secrets and in-house intellectual property through contractual arrangements, including confidentiality, non-competition and non-disclosure agreements with employees, and will continue to use such contractual arrangements in the future to help protect our proprietary intellectual property.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are not currently subject to any direct regulation by any government agency, other than regulations generally applicable to businesses.
 
General business regulations include the packaging, labeling, distribution, advertising and sale of our chemical products, such as those we sell, are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies, principally the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and to a lesser extent the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
 
Federal agencies, primarily the FTC, have a variety of procedures and enforcement remedies available to them, including the following:
 

· | initiating investigations, 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | issuing warning letters and cease and desist orders, 
· | requiring corrective labeling or advertising, 
· | requiring consumer redress, such as requiring that a company offer to repurchase products, previously sold to consumers, 
· | seeking injunctive relief or product seizures, 
· | imposing civil penalties, or, 
· | commencing civil action and/or criminal prosecution. 

 
In addition, certain state agencies have similar authority. These federal and state agencies have in the past used these remedies in regulating participants in the industry, including the imposition by federal agencies of civil penalties. We cannot assure you that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change or that such regulatory environment, or any specific action taken against us, will not result in a material adverse effect on our operations.
 
We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect such additional regulation, when and if it occurs, would have on our business in the future. Such additional regulation could require, however, any or all of the actions listed below, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations:
 

· | the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------
· | the recall or discontinuance of certain products, 
· | additional record keeping, 
· | expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, 
· | revised, expanded or different labeling, or 
· | additional scientific substantiation. 

Property
 
Our principal executive office is located at 710 N. Post Oak Road, Suite 315, Houston, Texas, where we lease approximately 1,429 square feet of office space on a three year term starting August 1, 2018, at a rate of $2,620 per month. We also have offices located in Carthage, Odessa and Alice, Texas. Our Carthage facility is comprised of approximately 2,500 square feet and one acre of property that is leased for $2,500 per month. The Carthage facility is on a month to month basis and is used for our operations throughout East Texas. On January 22, 2018, we entered into a two year lease for a 6,500 square foot building on approximately 1.5 acres in Odessa, Texas providing for three lease term extensions totaling six additional years. The initial rent is $6,500 per month and increased to $8,500 per month at the seventh month of the lease. After the first year anniversary, we may cancel the lease with 30 days’ notice to our landlord. Lease extensions are at our discretion and require rent increases. Our Alice facility includes an office and warehouse of approximately 1,200 square feet and a one acre yard which is leased at $2,000 per month. The lease is for six months, commencing on June 1, 2018 and automatically renews for six month terms unless cancelled by written notice.
