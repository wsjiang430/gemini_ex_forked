Our Business Drivers
Factors that drive demand for our business offerings include:

• | M&A Activity. M&A activity is an important driver for all of our segments. We offer services for all phases of the M&A process. Our services during the pre-transaction phase include government competition advice and pre-transaction analysis. Our services during the negotiation phase include due diligence, negotiation and other transaction advisory services, government competition and antitrust regulation services, expert advice, asset valuations and financial communications advice. We also offer post-M&A integration and transformation services.


• | Financial Markets. Financial market factors, including credit and financing availability, terms and conditions, the willingness of financial institutions to provide debt modifications or relief, corporate debt levels, default rates and capital markets transactions, are significant drivers of demand for our business offerings, particularly our Corporate Finance & Restructuring and Strategic Communications segments.


• | Regulatory Complexity, Public Scrutiny and Investigations. Increasingly complex global regulations and legislation, greater scrutiny of corporate governance, instances of corporate malfeasance, and more stringent and complex

12

reporting requirements drive demand for our business offerings. The need to understand and address the impact of regulation and legislation, as well as the increasing costs of doing business, have prompted companies to focus on better assessing and managing risks and opportunities. In addition, boards of directors, audit committees and independent board committees have been increasingly tasked with conducting internal investigations of financial wrongdoing, regulatory non-compliance and other issues. These factors and laws, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, have contributed to the demand for independent consultants and experts to investigate and provide analyses and to support the work of outside legal counsel, accountants and other advisors. These types of investigations also increasingly demand the use of multiple disciplinary service offerings like ours, which combine skills and capabilities across practices with industry expertise. These factors drive demand for various practices and services of all our segments.

• | Litigation and Disputes. Litigation and business disputes, the complexity of the issues presented, and the amount of potential damages and penalties drive demand for the services offered by many of our segments, particularly our Forensic and Litigation Consulting, Economic Consulting and Technology segments. Law firms and their clients, as well as government regulators and other interested third parties, rely on independent outside resources to evaluate claims, facilitate discovery, assess damages, provide expert reports and testimony, manage the pre-trial and in-trial process, and effectively present evidence.


• | Operational Challenges and Opportunities. Businesses facing challenges require the evaluation and re-evaluation of strategy, risks and opportunities as a result of crisis-driven situations, competition, regulation, innovation and other events that arise in the course of business. These challenges include enterprise risk management, global expansion, competition from established companies, and emerging businesses and technologies doing business in emerging markets, and new and changing regulatory requirements and legislation. Management, companies and their boards need outside help to recognize, understand and evaluate such events and effect change, which drives demand for independent expertise that can combine general business acumen with the specialized technical expertise of our practice offerings and industry expertise. These factors drive demand for various practices and services of all our segments.


• | Developing Markets. The growth of multinational firms and global consolidation can precipitate antitrust and competition scrutiny and the spread internationally of issues and practices that historically have been more common in the U.S., such as increased and complex litigation, corporate restructuring and bankruptcy activities, and antitrust and competition scrutiny. Companies in the developing world and multinational companies can benefit from our expert advice to access capital and business markets, comply with the regulatory and other requirements of multiple countries, structure M&A transactions and conduct due diligence, which drives demand for the services of all of our segments.

Our Competitive Strengths
We compete primarily on the basis of the breadth of our services, the quality of our work, the prominence of our professionals, our geographic reach, our reputation and performance record, our specific industry expertise and our strong client relationships. We believe our success is driven by a combination of long-standing competitive strengths, including:

• | Pre-eminent Businesses and Professionals. We believe that our segments include some of the pre-eminent practices and professionals in our industry today. During 2018, the awards and recognitions received by the Company include the following:

• | Diversified Service Offerings. Our five reportable segments offer a diversified portfolio of practices providing services within our four geographic regions. Our broad range of practices and services, the diversity of our revenue streams, our specialized industry expertise and our global locations distinguish us from our competitors. This diversity helps to mitigate the impact of crises, events and changes in a particular practice, industry or country.


• | Diversified Portfolio of Elite Clients. We provide services to a diverse group of clients, including global Fortune 500 companies, FTSE 100 companies, global financial institutions, banks, and local, state and national governments and agencies in the U.S. and other countries. Additionally, 96 of the 100 law firms as ranked by American Lawyer Global 100: Most Revenue List refer or engage us on behalf of multiple clients on multiple matters.


• | Strong Cash Flow. Our business model has several characteristics that produce consistent cash flows. Our strong cash flow supports business operations, capital expenditures, and research and development efforts in our Technology segment and our ability to service our indebtedness and pursue our growth and other strategies.


• | Demand for Integrated Solutions and a Consultative Approach. Our breadth and depth of practice and service offerings and industry expertise across the globe drive demand by businesses that seek our integrated services and consultative approach covering different aspects of event-driven occurrences, reputational issues and transactions across different jurisdictions.

Our Business Strategy
We build client relationships based on the quality of our services, our brand and the reputation of our professionals. We provide diverse complementary services to meet our clients’ needs around the world. We emphasize client service and satisfaction. We aim to build strong brand recognition. The following are key elements of our business strategy:

• | Leverage Our Practitioners, Businesses, Extensive Geographic Diversification and Relationships. We work hard to maintain and strengthen our core practices and competencies. We believe that our recognized expertise, client relationships and the quality of our reputation, coupled with our successful track record, size and geographic diversity, are the most critical elements in a decision to retain us. Many of our professionals are recognized experts in their respective fields.


• | Grow Organically. Our strategy is to grow organically by increasing headcount and market share to provide clients with an attractive and evolving suite of services across our segments, as well as the industries and geographic regions in which we operate.


• | Attract and Retain Highly Qualified Professionals. Our professionals are crucial to delivering our services to clients and generating new business. As of December 31, 2018, we employed 3,756 revenue-generating professionals, many of whom have an established and widely recognized name in their respective service and industry specialization. Through our substantial staff of highly qualified professionals, we can handle a large number of complex assignments simultaneously. To attract and retain highly qualified professionals, we offer significant compensation opportunities, including sign-on bonuses, forgivable loans, retention bonuses, cash incentive bonuses and equity compensation, along with a competitive benefits package and the chance to work on challenging global engagements with other highly skilled peers.


• | Enhance Profitability. We endeavor to manage costs, headcount, utilization, bill rates and pricing for both time and materials and alternative fee arrangements to operate profitably.


• | Acquisitions and Other Investments. Enhance value through capital allocation: The strength of our balance sheet gives us the flexibility to allocate capital and create shareholder value in numerous ways including investments in hiring new

14

employees, acquisitions and share repurchases. We consider strategic and opportunistic acquisition opportunities on a selective basis. We seek to integrate completed acquisitions and manage investments in a way that fosters organic growth, expands our geographic presence or complements our segments, practices, services and industry focuses. We typically structure our acquisitions to retain the services of key individuals from the acquired companies.
Our Employees
Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain our expert professional workforce. Our professionals include PhDs, MBAs, JDs, CPAs, CPA-ABVs (CPAs accredited in business valuations), CPA-CFFs (CPAs certified in financial forensics), CRAs (certified risk analysts), Certified Turnaround Professionals, Certified Insolvency and Reorganization Advisors, Certified Fraud Examiners, ASAs (accredited senior appraisers), construction engineers and former senior government officials. We also engage independent contractors to supplement our professionals on client engagements as needed. As of December 31, 2018, we employed 4,768 employees, of which 3,756 were revenue-generating professionals.
Employment Agreements
As of December 31, 2018, we had written employment arrangements with substantially all of our 486 Senior Managing Directors and equivalent personnel (collectively, “SMD”). These arrangements generally provide for fixed salary and participation in incentive payment programs (which, in some cases, may be based on financial measures such as EBITDA or relative total shareholder return), salary continuation benefits, accrued bonuses and other benefits beyond the termination date if an SMD leaves our employment for specified reasons prior to the expiration date of the employment agreement. The length and amount of payments to be paid by us following the termination or resignation of an SMD may vary, depending on whether the person resigned with or without “good reason” or was terminated by us with or without “cause,” retired or did not renew, died or became “disabled,” or was terminated as a result of a “change in control” (all such terms as defined in such SMD’s employment agreement). All of our written employment arrangements with SMDs require some notice period be given by the party prior to termination of employment and include covenants providing for restrictions on the SMDs competing against, and soliciting employees from, the Company for a specified period of time following the end of the SMDs employment.
Incentive and Retention Payments
Our SMDs and other employees, consultants and professionals may receive incentive, retention or sign-on payments, on a case-by-case basis, through unsecured general recourse forgivable loans, equity awards or other payments (collectively, “Retention Awards”). We believe that providing these multi-year Retention Awards greatly enhances our ability to attract and retain our key professionals.  
Some or all of the principal amount and accrued interest of the loans we make will be forgiven by us upon the passage of time, or their repayment will be funded by us through additional cash bonus compensation, provided that the recipient is an employee or consultant on the forgiveness date. In addition, upon certain termination events, accrued interest and the outstanding principal balance may be forgiven, including upon death, disability and, in some cases, retirement or termination by the Company without cause or the recipient with good reason, or the recipient may be required to repay the unpaid accrued interest and outstanding principal balance upon certain other termination events such as voluntary resignation, as provided in the applicable promissory note. The value of the forgivable loans we have made, in the aggregate, as well as on an individual basis, have been, and we anticipate will continue to be, significant. Our executive officers and outside directors are not eligible to receive loans, and no loans have been made to them.
Our executive officers, other members of senior management and outside directors, as well as employees and independent service providers, have received and will continue to receive equity awards, which may include stock option and share-based awards (including awards in the form of restricted stock, performance-based restricted stock units, deferred restricted stock units, and cash-settled stock appreciation rights and units), on a case-by-case basis, to the extent that shares are available under our stockholder-approved equity compensation plans. The value of such equity and cash-based awards, in the aggregate, as well as on an individual basis, has been and is expected to continue to be significant.
Recipients of sign-on or other retention payments, other than loans, may be required to repay a portion or all of the original payment upon a termination event. These awards are typically smaller amounts in nature than forgivable loans and have a shorter service requirement than forgivable loans.
Select SMDs may participate in certain incentive compensation programs, such as our Senior Managing Director Incentive Compensation Program in the U.S., UK and Canada (the “ICP”) or the Key Senior Managing Director Incentive Plan (the “KSIP”). The ICP was closed to new participants effective January 2015. Participants were recommended by management and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. The ICP and KSIP provide for a combination of forgivable loans, equity awards and retention bonuses that are paid over an average of six to 10 years depending 
15

on the program and economic value of the award. These programs also require participants to defer a portion of their bonus in the form of cash or restricted stock over a two-to-three-year period.
Marketing
We rely primarily on our senior professionals to identify and pursue business opportunities. Referrals from clients, law firms and other intermediaries and our reputation from prior engagements are also key factors in securing new business. Our professionals often learn about new business opportunities from their frequent contacts and close working relationships with clients. In marketing our services, we emphasize our experience, the quality of our services and our professionals’ particular areas of expertise, as well as our ability to quickly staff new and large engagements. While we aggressively seek new business opportunities, we maintain high professional standards and carefully evaluate potential new client relationships and engagements before accepting them. We also employ or contract with sales professionals who are tasked primarily with marketing the services of our Corporate Finance & Restructuring, Forensic and Litigation Consulting, Technology and Strategic Communications segments.
Clients
During the year ended December 31, 2018, no single client accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. No reportable segment had a single client that accounted for more than 10% of its respective total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. In some cases, we may have engagements through law firms that represent a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues or the revenues of a segment; however, each law firm engages us on behalf of multiple clients.
Competition
We compete with different companies or businesses of companies depending on the particular nature of a proposed engagement and the requested types of service(s) or the location of the client or delivery of the service(s) or product(s). Our businesses are highly competitive. Our competitors include large organizations, such as the global accounting firms and large management and financial consulting companies, that offer a broad range of consulting services; investment banking firms; IT consulting and software companies that offer niche services that are the same or similar to services or products offered by one or more of our segments; and small firms and independent contractors that provide one or more specialized services.
We compete primarily on the basis of the breadth of our services, the quality of our work, the prominence of our professionals, our geographic reach, our reputation and performance record, our specific industry expertise, our ability to staff multiple significant engagements across disciplines and industries in multiple locations, and our strong client relationships. Our Technology segment, particularly with respect to hosting services, and to a lesser extent our other segments, may also compete on price, although the critical nature of the services provided by our Corporate Finance & Restructuring, Forensic and Litigation Consulting, and Economic Consulting segments typically makes price a secondary consideration with respect to those segments. Since our businesses depend in large part on professional relationships, there are low barriers of entry for professionals, including our professionals, electing to work independently, start their own firms or change employers.
Our Corporate Finance & Restructuring segment primarily competes with specialty boutiques providing restructuring, bankruptcy or M&A services and, to a lesser extent, large investment banks and global accounting firms.
Our Forensic and Litigation Consulting segment primarily competes with other large consulting companies and global accounting firms with service offerings similar to ours.
Our Economic Consulting segment primarily competes with individually recognized economists, specialty boutiques and large consulting companies with service offerings similar to ours.
Our Technology segment primarily competes with consulting and/or software providers specializing in e-discovery, ESI and the management of electronic content. Competitors may offer products and/or services intended to address one piece or more of those areas. There continues to be significant consolidation of companies providing products and services similar to our Technology segment, through M&A and other transactions, which may provide competitors access to greater financial and other resources than those of FTI Consulting. This industry is subject to significant and rapid innovation. Larger competitors may be able to invest more in research and development or react more quickly to new regulatory or legal requirements and other changes and may be able to innovate more quickly and efficiently. In addition, companies compete aggressively against our Technology segment on the basis of price, particularly with respect to hosting and e-discovery services.
Our Strategic Communications segment competes with large public relations firms, as well as boutique M&A, crisis communications and public affairs firms.
16

Some service providers are larger than we are and, on certain engagements, may have an advantage over us with respect to one or more competitive factors. Specialty boutiques or smaller local or regional firms, while not offering the range of services we provide, may compete with us on the basis of geographic proximity, specialty services or pricing advantages.
