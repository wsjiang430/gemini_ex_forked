ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
References to “Brinker,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in this Form 10-K refer to Brinker International, Inc. and its subsidiaries and any predecessor companies of Brinker International, Inc.
We own, develop, operate and franchise the Chili’s® Grill & Bar (“Chili’s”) and Maggiano’s Little Italy® (“Maggiano’s”) restaurant brands. The Company was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware in September 1983 to succeed to the business operated by Chili’s, Inc., a Texas corporation, which was organized in August 1977. We completed the acquisition of Maggiano’s in August 1995. 
Restaurant Brands
Chili’s Grill & Bar
Chili’s, a recognized leader in the bar & grill category of casual dining, has been operating restaurants for over 40 years. Chili’s enjoys a global presence with locations in the United States, 29 countries and two territories outside of the United States. Whether domestic or international, Company-owned or franchised, Chili’s is dedicated to delivering fresh, high-quality food with a unique point of view, as well as dining experiences that make people feel special. Historically, Chili’s menu has featured bold, kicked-up American favorites. Chili’s has built a reputation for gourmet burgers, sizzling fajitas, baby back ribs and hand-shaken margaritas. We have refocused on and reinvested in these core equities, and we plan to continue to innovate our food offerings within these core menu platforms. We believe our focused menu, our “Chilihead” culture, our focus on standards and our reputation for hospitality will allow Chili’s to differentiate our food and service from other restaurants.

We also believe that guests are evolving not only their standards of food quality but also their expectations of convenience. Chili’s To Go menu is available online, by calling the restaurant, or through our mobile app. In the summer of 2017, we began offering curbside service at all our Company-owned restaurants for orders placed through our website or mobile app. Curbside service has now been expanded and is available at most franchise restaurants. In fiscal 2018, we relaunched our My Chili’s Rewards program and began offering free chips and salsa or a soft drink to members at every visit (guests must visit every 60 days to receive the offer). In fiscal 2019, we focused on our systems and standards for consistency across operations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we partnered with DoorDash to make delivery of Chili’s another convenience option for guests from most company-owned Chili’s restaurants.
During the fiscal year ended June 26, 2019, at our Company-owned restaurants, entrée selections ranged in menu price from $8.00 to $19.49. The average revenue per meal, including alcoholic beverages, was approximately $15.47 per person. Also during fiscal 2019, food and non-alcoholic beverage sales constituted approximately 86.5% of Chili’s total restaurant revenues, with alcoholic beverage sales accounting for the remaining 13.5%. Our average annual net sales volume per Company-owned Chili’s restaurant during fiscal 2019 was $2.9 million.
Maggiano’s Little Italy
Maggiano’s is a full-service, national, polished casual restaurant brand offering Italian-American cuisine. With a passion for making people feel special, the brand is known for catering to special occasions and large parties. Each Maggiano’s location is uniquely designed and features open dining rooms with fresh flowers, rich woods, warm carpets and soft lighting. Most locations feature designated banquet facilities and all offer catering for large parties at homes or local businesses. Our full carryout menu is also available for pick up or delivered through a third party service. Each Maggiano’s has an executive chef preparing authentic recipes from scratch ingredients. Dishes are served in abundant portions both à la carte and family style. We offer a full range of lunch and dinner options, complimented by a premium wine list and handcrafted cocktails. On Saturdays and Sundays, all Maggiano’s restaurants offer a brunch menu alongside our lunch menu.
During the fiscal year ended June 26, 2019, entrée selections ranged in menu price from $12.30 to $47.99. The average revenue per meal, including alcoholic beverages, was approximately $28.66 per person. Also during fiscal 2019, food and non-alcoholic beverage sales constituted approximately 85.1% of Maggiano’s total restaurant revenues, with alcoholic beverage sales accounting for the remaining 14.9%. Sales from events at our banquet facilities made up 17.8% of Maggiano’s total restaurant revenues for the year. Our average annual sales volume per Maggiano’s restaurant during fiscal 2019 was $8.3 million.
Business Strategy
This information is set forth in the section “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview” within Exhibit 13 to this document. We incorporate that information in this document by reference.
Company Development
During fiscal 2019, we continued the expansion of our restaurant brands domestically through a select number of new Company-owned restaurants in strategically desirable markets. We concentrate on the development of certain identified markets that are most likely to improve our competitive position and achieve the desired level of marketing potential, profitability and return on invested capital. Our domestic expansion efforts focus not only on major metropolitan areas in the United States but also on smaller market areas and non-traditional locations (such as airports and universities) that can adequately support our restaurant brands. For smaller market areas, we have developed a new smaller prototype building for both brands that allows us to expand into these markets and serve our guests while maintaining a focus on profitability and return on invested capital.
The restaurant site selection process is critical, and we devote significant effort to the investigation of new locations utilizing a variety of sophisticated analytical techniques. Our process evaluates a variety of factors, including:

• | trade area demographics, such as target population density and household income levels;


• | physical site characteristics, such as visibility, accessibility and traffic volume;

4


• | relative proximity to activity centers, such as shopping centers, hotel and entertainment complexes and office buildings; and


• | supply and demand trends, such as proposed infrastructure improvements, new developments and existing and potential competition.

Members of each brand’s executive team inspect, review and approve each restaurant site prior to its lease or acquisition for that brand.
The specific rate at which we are able to open new restaurants is determined, in part, by our success in locating satisfactory sites, negotiating acceptable lease or purchase terms, securing appropriate local governmental permits and approvals, and by our capacity to supervise construction and recruit and train management and hourly team members.
The following table illustrates the Company-owned restaurants opened in fiscal 2019 and the projected openings in fiscal 2020:

 | Fiscal 2019 | Fiscal 2020 
 | Fiscal Year Openings | Full Year Projected Openings
New Openings | | 
Company-owned restaurants | | 
Chili’s domestic | 4 | | 9-11
Chili’s international | — | | — 
Maggiano’s | — | | — 
Total company-owned | 4 | | 9-11
Relocation Openings | | 
Chili’s domestic company-owned relocations | 5 | | 0-2 

We periodically re-evaluate Company-owned restaurant sites to monitor that attributes have not deteriorated below our minimum standards. In the event site deterioration occurs, each brand makes a concerted effort to improve the restaurant’s performance by providing physical, operating and marketing enhancements unique to each restaurant’s situation. In some cases the brand considers relocation to a proximate, more desirable site, or evaluates closing the restaurant if the brand’s measurement criteria, such as return on investment and area demographic trends, do not support relocation. During fiscal 2019, we relocated five Company-owned restaurants, and closed an additional three Company-owned restaurants that were generally performing below our standards or were near or at the expiration of their lease terms. In fiscal 2020, we plan to relocate up to two Company-owned Chili’s restaurants. Our strategic plan is targeted to support our long-term growth objectives, with a focus on continued development of those restaurant locations that have the greatest return potential for the Company and our shareholders.

Franchise Development
In addition to our development of Company-owned restaurants, our restaurant brands pursue expansion through our franchisees. The following table illustrates the franchise restaurants opened in fiscal 2019 and the projected openings in fiscal 2020:

 | Fiscal 2019 | Fiscal 2020 
 | Fiscal Year Openings | Full Year Projected Openings
New Openings | | 
Franchise restaurants | | 
Chili’s domestic | 4 | | 3 
Chili’s international | 18 | | 27-32
Maggiano’s | 1 | | 1 
Total franchise | 23 | | 31-36

(3) | Overall - the percentages in this column are based on the total number of franchised restaurants (domestic and international) versus total system-wide number of restaurants.

International
We continue our international growth through development agreements with new and existing franchise partners, introducing Chili’s to new countries and expanding the brand within our existing markets. As of June 26, 2019, we have 20 total development arrangements. During fiscal 2019, our international franchisees opened 18 Chili’s restaurants. We intentionally exited certain franchise partnerships that were not developing the markets effectively, and entered into new development agreements with new and existing franchisees for development in southern and western India, and Ecuador.
We plan to strategically pursue expansion of Chili’s internationally in areas where we see the most growth opportunities. Our international agreements provide the vehicle for payment of development fees and initial franchise fees in addition to subsequent royalty fees based on the gross sales of each restaurant. We expect future agreements to remain limited to enterprises that demonstrate a proven track record as a restaurant operator and showcase financial strength that can support a multi-unit development agreement.
Domestic
We remain committed to finding and working with new and existing domestic franchise partners to develop more restaurants. As of June 26, 2019, one domestic development arrangement existed. Similar to our international agreements, a typical domestic agreement provides for payment of development and initial franchise fees in addition 
6

to subsequent royalty and advertising fees based on the gross sales of each restaurant. We expect future domestic agreements to remain limited to enterprises having significant experience as restaurant operators and proven financial ability to support and develop multi-unit operations.
During the fiscal year ended June 26, 2019, a domestic franchisee opened the first domestic Maggiano’s franchise location.
In addition, we have from time to time purchased restaurants from our franchisees in order to support our growth objectives in certain markets. During the fiscal year ended June 26, 2019, we purchased three restaurants previously owned and operated by our franchisees. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we executed a letter of intent to acquire 116 Chili’s restaurants owned by ERJ Dining, a franchisee, located in the Midwest United States. This acquisition is expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and represents an opportunity to create value for our shareholders and generate additional earnings and cash flow growth. We remain committed to supporting the growth of our existing franchisees. After this transaction is completed, our percentage of franchise operated domestic Chili’s restaurants will decrease to approximately 15% from the 24% presented in the above Percentage of Franchise Operated Restaurants table as of June 26, 2019. 
Restaurant Management
Our Chili’s and Maggiano’s brands have separate designated teams who support each brand, including operations, finance, franchise, marketing, human resources and culinary. We believe these strategic, brand-focused teams foster the identities of the individual and uniquely positioned brands. To maximize efficiencies, brands continue to utilize common and shared infrastructure, including, among other services, accounting, information technology, purchasing, guest relations, legal, and restaurant development.
At the restaurant level, management structure varies by brand. A typical restaurant is led by a management team including a general managing partner, two additional managers and shift leaders and for Maggiano’s, an additional three to four chefs. The level of restaurant supervision depends upon the operating complexity and sales volume of individual locations.
We believe there is a high correlation between the quality of restaurant management and the long-term success of a brand. In that regard, we encourage increased experience at all management positions through various short and long-term incentive programs, which may include equity ownership. These programs, coupled with a general management philosophy emphasizing quality of life, have enabled us to attract and retain key team members, and enjoy lower turnover of managers and team members that we believe is below industry averages.
We strive to ensure consistent quality standards in our brands through the issuance of operational manuals covering all elements of operations and food and beverage manuals, which provide guidance for preparation of brand-formulated recipes. Routine visitation to the restaurants by all levels of supervision enforces strict adherence to our overall brand standards and operating procedures. Each brand is responsible for maintaining their operational training program. Depending on the brand, the training program typically includes a training period of two to three months for restaurant management trainees, as well as special training for high-potential team members and managers. We also provide recurring management training for managers and supervisors to improve effectiveness or prepare them for more responsibility.
Supply Chain
Our ability to maintain consistent quality and continuity of supply throughout each restaurant brand depends upon acquiring products from reliable sources. Our approved suppliers and our restaurants are required to adhere to strict product and safety specifications established through our quality assurance and culinary programs. These requirements are intended to ensure high-quality products are served in each of our restaurants. We strategically negotiate directly with major suppliers to obtain competitive prices. We also use purchase commitment contracts when appropriate to stabilize the potentially volatile pricing associated with certain commodity items. All essential products are available from pre-qualified distributors to be delivered to our restaurant brands. Additionally, as a purchaser of a variety of food products, we require our suppliers to adhere to our supplier code of conduct, which sets forth our expectation on business integrity, food safety and food ingredients, animal welfare and sustainability. Due to the relatively rapid 
7

turnover of perishable food products and inventories in the restaurants, which consist primarily of food, beverages and supplies, our inventories have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to revenues. Internationally, our franchisees may encounter cultural and regulatory differences resulting in variances with product specifications for international restaurant locations.
Advertising and Marketing
As a “polished casual” restaurant, with 53 locations, Maggiano’s primarily targets guests from affluent households who live and work around the higher-end malls where the majority of Maggiano’s restaurants are located. Maggiano’s relies on digital marketing, direct marketing, social media and word of mouth to advertise to new guests.
As a large, nationally penetrated bar and grill brand, Chili’s appeals to a broader population. More than 50 million Americans visit Chili’s every three months, ranging across all income and ethnic groups. As casual dining traffic has softened in recent years, we have worked hard to be more precise in defining the Chili’s target guest. Today our primary focus for developing menu innovation and targeting our TV and digital advertising are the Generation X and Millennial families who desire quality food, good value and a service experience that allows them to connect with family and friends. These young families represent a significant percentage of our guest base today and, we believe, will only grow in importance in the years ahead.
Our domestic Chili’s franchise agreements generally require advertising contributions to us by the franchisees. We use these contributions, in conjunction with Company funds, for the purpose of retaining advertising agencies, obtaining consumer insights, developing and producing brand-specific creative materials and purchasing national or regional media to meet the brand’s strategy. Some franchisees also spend additional amounts on local advertising. Any such local advertising is required to be approved by us.
Team Members
As of June 26, 2019, we employed 56,147 team members, of which 572 were restaurant support and corporate personnel located in Dallas, Texas, and 4,405 were restaurant regional and area directors, managers, or trainees. The remaining 51,170 were employed in non-management restaurant positions. Our executive officers have an average of 25 years of experience in the restaurant industry.
In a competitive labor market, we have developed key recruitment and retention strategies that we believe have resulted in record-high internal engagement rates and industry-low turnover. Our internal promotion rate continues to climb as we focus on helping our team members turn their restaurant jobs into lasting careers. These career paths are made possible by a number of development programs, including Best You EDU, a no-cost education program providing foundational learning, ESL, GED, and associate’s degree programs, and the Certified Shift Leader program which is accredited as an apprenticeship through the National Restaurant Association Education Foundation and United States Department of Labor, and is intended to give hourly team members a clear path into management. While developing these programs, we have simultaneously launched all-new digital training for team members at all levels of the Company that uses digital technology and innovative learning methodologies to set our team members up for success as part of our commitment to develop future leaders in the restaurant industry.
The majority of our team members, outside of restaurant management and restaurant support and corporate personnel, are paid on an hourly basis. We stand firm in the belief that we provide competitive working conditions and wages favorable to other companies in our industry. Our team members are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements.
Cyber Security
During fiscal 2018, we issued a public statement that malware had been discovered at certain Chili’s restaurants that resulted in unauthorized access or acquisition of customer payment card data. For further information about this cyber security incident refer to Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies presented within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements attached as part of Exhibit 13 of this filing.
