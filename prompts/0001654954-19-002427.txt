  Item 1. Business
    
  General
  
 Insignia Systems, Inc. (“Insignia,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company”) was incorporated in 1990, as a Minnesota corporation. Insignia is a leading provider of in-store marketing solutions to our partners and clients which consist of consumer-packaged goods (“CPG”) manufacturers, retailers and marketing agencies and digital. We believe our products and services are attractive to CPG manufacturers because of our speed to market, ability to customize advertising programs at store level and our deep industry knowledge. We have leaders and employees with extensive industry knowledge with direct experience in CPG manufacturers and retailers. During 2018, Insignia provided advertising solutions to CPG manufacturers spanning from some of the largest multinationals to new and emerging brands.
  
  Our relationships with retailers are forged through executional excellence, flexible processes and our ability to connect retailer messaging with our CPG manufacturer’s message. During 2018, Insignia ran in-store advertising programs at national and regional US retailers who are leaders in their respective channels.
  
  Our relationships with marketing agencies continue to grow through our agility, responsiveness, custom production and execution capabilities, and our ability to respond to their client’s needs with precision and efficiency.
  
 Insignia’s primary solution has been the Point-Of-Purchase Services (POPS®) in-store signage solution. The Insignia POPS solution is a national, account-specific, shelf-edge advertising and promotion tactic. Internal testing has indicated the solution is capable of delivering incremental sales for the featured brand. Participation in the POPS solution allows CPG manufacturers to deliver vital product information to consumers at the point-of-purchase, and to leverage the local retailer brand and store-specific prices to provide a unique “call to action” that draws attention to the featured brand and triggers a purchase decision. CPG manufacturers benefit from Insignia’s nimble operational capabilities, which include short lead times, in-house graphic design capabilities, post-program analytics, and micro-marketing capabilities such as variable or bilingual messaging.
  
  Over the past several years, we have developed and now offer promotional, merchandising and digital solutions in addition to our core business of in-store signage solutions. Our expanded portfolio of solutions allows us to more completely meet the needs of CPG manufacturers, retailers and their agents as their business strategies evolve behind an ever-changing retail landscape.

  Industry and Market Background
  
 Our industry is rapidly evolving in several ways:
  
   (1)
 Brand loyalty: consumer brand loyalty is shifting from established CPG manufacturers to emerging brands, who often have distribution outside our core syndicated network and are looking for solutions to help them with immediate trial and awareness.

 
   (2)
 Retailer fragmentation: consumers are driving retailer fragmentation, including online purchases, as a result CPG manufacturer are diversifying their advertising dollars across an omnichannel envirnment.

 
   (3)
   Financial justification: CPG manufacturers are increasingly focused on top and bottom line financial metrics which drives increased pressure to generate positive advertising return on investments.

 
   (4)
 Competition shift: Digital advertising spend is reducing spend on traditional media, including in-store advertising, driving increased competition from direct competitors, retailer led marketing programs, and digital media companies.

 Despite rapid growth in e-commerce both retailers and CPG manufacturers are actively seeking to grow their brands in physical stores. On the retail side, many of the top US retailers have either opened new stores, introduced new formats or invested heavily in major store renovations. As a result, retailers are actively seeking solutions that can help drive traffic into the store. Retailers seek companies like Insignia to help build in-store solutions that navigate active shoppers to strategic parts of the store. We believe retailers are continuing to seek ways to connect their online strategies with their in-store strategies to build shopper loyalty and to develop solutions to enhance the shopper's in-store experience. On the CPG manufacturer side, brand consolidation, shrinking advertising budgets among CPG manufacturers and overall commodity uncertainties continue to place significant pressure on our industry. We believe CPG manufacturers are increasingly looking for opportunities to reinforce their brand equity as close as possible to the point of purchase or to expand the number of locations where they are offered in store to ensure they are selected over competition. We believe emerging brands are looking for ways to tell shoppers their story and explain their unique features, benefits and points of difference. These trends along with new developments in shopper analytics are opening opportunities for innovative companies to develop new products and new ways of helping retailers and brands connect with shoppers. Insignia is usually engaged as part of an overall, mixed-media, brand marketing campaign. Our solutions offer CPG manufacturers the unique features not available to other marketing services providers and help their brands “close the sale” at the point of purchase and across other areas of the in-store retail environment.
 Product Solutions
  
 Since our inception in 1990, Insignia has worked closely with CPG manufacturers and retailers to understand their evolving needs and introduce solutions that help them achieve their business strategies. Over most of the past decade, Insignia’s core product has been In-Store Signage Solutions, namely POPS. Over the past year, we have significantly expanded our offered solutions to develop a portfolio designed to more holistically meet the needs of our clients and partners. For example, our In-Store Signage Solutions represented approximately 79% of our total net sales for 2018, compared to 92% of the Company’s total net sales in 2017.
  
  1. 
 In-Store Signage Solutions

 
  ● 
 Our signage solutions help brands achieve a variety of objectives that include awareness and sales lift. POPS signs are placed perpendicular to the shelf and attract the attention of the shopper even before they arrive in front of the shelf to consider a product. Attractive equity and engaging creative helps convert the shopper from considering a product into purchasing the product.

 
  ● 
 Because of existing arrangements with our primary competitors, POPS is the only in-store signage solution available in the U.S. market that is able to present store-level pricing in conjunction with CPG and retailer brand messaging. Additionally, signs are installed in close proximity to the CPG manufacturer’s product in participating stores.

 
  ● 
 CPG manufacturers pay marketing program rates based upon the directed number of cycles and retailer/store count. We collect and organize data from the CPG manufacturers and participating retailers, design and print the signage, and deliver signage to specified retailers. Depending on the agreement with the retailer, either a third-party professional installer or store personnel use placement instructions to install the correct signage at the shelf during the correct timeframe.

 
  2. 
 Merchandising Solutions

 
  ● 
 These solutions help brands deliver additional awareness and drive impulse purchases via a secondary placement of their products. Retailers selectively award brands incremental temporary space in the store to showcase their products. Our merchandising solution delivers a variety of creative corrugate displays, side caps and power panels that brands leverage to grow their sales.

 
  3. 
 Promotion Solutions

 
  ● 
 Our promotion solutions are typically placed on the product package. These solutions can drive impulse purchases, sales and capture share within a very short period. Examples include coupons, recipes, and cross-promotions.

 
  4. 
 Digital Solutions

 
  ● 
 Our digital solutions currently consist of mobile and programmatic advertising. Most CPG manufacturers are relying on digital advertising for promoting their products to consumers. As part of an integrated marketing plan, Insignia develops and executes digital advertising and in-store marketing in cadence with brand plans and expectations.

 Custom Print Solutions

 
   ●
 Our custom print solutions offer small and large format print solutions and cardstock to retailers. These solutions help them increase awareness of store events and other marketing programs.
 Marketing and Sales
  
 Our highly skilled direct sales and marketing teams have deep knowledge of our CPG manufacturers and retailers and represent a major asset for the organization. Our sales organization is split into two separate groups:
  
   1.
 Sales to CPG manufacturers. This group is dedicated to understanding the challenges faced by both large and small brands and helping develop solutions that address their needs. During 2018, they worked with over 100 CPG manufacturers.

 
   2.
 Sales to retailers. This group is responsible for understanding each retailer’s unique needs and build solutions to address them. During 2018, this team worked with retailers that own or represent thousands of national and regional retail stores.

 
 Marketing is focused on the following:
  
   ●
 Increasing awareness of our corporate brand;

 
   ●
 Analyzing the effectiveness of executed offerings;

 
   ●
 Developing and commercializing new solutions; and

 
   ●
 Enhancing and marketing existing solutions.

 
 We are authorized to sell in-store solutions into a network of retailers that is managed and maintained through direct relationships, and through a contract with News America Marketing In-Store, LLC (“News America”). During the majority of 2018, we also accessed certain retailers in the Dollar Channel, which did not account for a material amount of our sales in 2018, through an agreement with Valassis Sales and Marketing Services, Inc. In December 2018, Valassis announced its exit from in-store marketing generally and our agreement was terminated.
  
 During 2018 and 2017, foreign sales accounted for less than 1% of total net sales each year. The Company expects sales to foreign distributors will remain less than 1% of total net sales in 2019.
  
  Competition
  
 Insignia faces increasingly intense competition for the marketing expenditures of CPG manufacturers for at-shelf advertising-related signage. We have observed increased competition in growing and maintaining our network of retailers into which we are authorized to sell solutions as competitors continue to purchase new or extend exclusive arrangements with retailers for that purpose. We are party to an agreement with News America that entitles us to opportunities to sell signs with price in specific parts of News America’s retail network through February 2021, but we have experienced limited success gaining additional access to News America’s retail network. Furthermore, we face increased competition for advertising dollars with News America’s other at-shelf advertising and promotional signage offerings.
  
 Our In-Store Signage Solutions are subject to increasing pressures from alternatives to traditional in-store signage, including digital and merchandising solutions offered by competitors including Vestcom, Menasha, Valassis Digital and Quotient.

 We believe the primary competitive strengths of the Company include:
 
   ●
 Working with CPG manufacturers to help achieve sales lift, create brand awareness, generate program ROI, or support of retailer programs;


   ●
 Managing and providing turn-key access to a national network of retailers in support of objectives listed above; including smaller regional or independent retailers, which tend to be under-served by our competitors and difficult to aggregate at the national level;


   ●
 Variable messaging capabilities including bi-lingual targeting; and


   ●
 Shorter lead times on marketing program execution.

 Strategic Plan
  
 Insignia’s strategic plan, launched early in 2018, seeks to build on recent success, situate Insignia for growth within our industry, and differentiate Insignia from our competition. The strategic plan consists of:
  
   1.
 Build the Base. Future success is dependent on increasing the salability of our retail network, heightened focus on end-to-end execution, and continued focus on our cost structure.

 
   2.
 Change the Game. Increased competition requires change. Insignia is focused on continued diversification of our product portfolio, amplifying our insights and analytics, and leveraging retailer centric offerings.

 
   3.
 Create Advocates. Insignia has increased its presence within the industry. This will continue within our strategic plan as Insignia will continue to cultivate new alliances, build our corporate awareness, and strive to be the first call.

 
   4.
 Invest in our future. Achieving our strategic plan requires Insignia to continue to recruit and retain top talent, invest in training and development and strengthening our capabilities.

 
 Our strategic plan addresses the challenges we face within our industry, given the rapid evolution of change, we continue to be faced with risk of short-to-intermediate term volatility in our operating and financial performance.
  
  Customers
  
 The Company provides solutions to a wide variety of CPG manufacturers ranging from large Fortune 500 manufacturers to new brands who have just secured initial distribution. These solutions help brands and retailers connect, engage and build better relationships with their consumers to increase awareness, trial, sales and loyalty.
