Item 1. Business Overview
Cushman & Wakefield plc (together with its subsidiaries, “Cushman & Wakefield,” “the Company,” “we,” “ours” and “us”) is a preeminent global leading commercial real estate services firm with an iconic brand and approximately 51,000 employees led by an experienced executive team. We operate from approximately 400 offices in 70 countries, managing approximately 3.6 billion square feet of commercial real estate space on behalf of institutional, corporate and private clients. We serve the world’s real estate owners and occupiers, delivering a broad suite of services through our integrated and scalable platform. Our business is focused on meeting the increasing demands of our clients through a comprehensive offering of services including Property, facilities and project management, Leasing, Capital markets, Valuation and other services. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we generated revenues of $8.2 billion, $6.9 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively, and Fee revenues of $6.0 billion, $5.3 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. Fee revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure, please refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a definition of Fee revenue, a description of the purposes for which our management uses Fee revenue and a reconciliation of Fee revenue to revenue.
Since 2014, we have built our company organically and through the combination of DTZ, Cassidy Turley and Cushman & Wakefield, giving us the scale and worldwide footprint to effectively serve our clients’ multinational businesses. The result is a global real estate services firm with the iconic Cushman & Wakefield brand, steeped in over 100 years of leadership. We were recently named #2 in our industry’s top brand study, the Lipsey Company’s Top 25 Commercial Real Estate Brands. 
The past several years have been a period of rapid growth and transformation for our company. Our experienced management team has been focused on integrating companies, driving operating efficiencies, realizing cost savings, attracting and retaining talent and improving financial performance. In August 2018, Cushman & Wakefield successfully completed an initial public offering (the "IPO"), listing the firm on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: CWK).
Today, Cushman & Wakefield is one of the top three real estate services providers as measured by revenue and workforce. We have made significant investments in technology and workflows to support our growth strategy to improve our productivity and drive better outcomes for our clients. We have built a scalable platform that is well positioned to execute our growth strategy focused on: (i) participating in further industry consolidation; (ii) meeting the growing outsourcing and service needs of our target customer base; and (iii) leveraging our strong competitive position to increase our market share. Our proven track record of strong operational and financial performance leaves us well-positioned to capitalize on the attractive and growing commercial real estate services industry.
Our Principal Services and Regions of Operation
We have organized our business, and report our operating results, through three geographic segments: the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"); and Asia Pacific ("APAC") representing 70%, 12% and 18% of our 2018 revenue and 68%, 15% and 17% of our 2018 Fee revenue, respectively. Within those segments, we operate the following service lines: Property, facilities and project management; Leasing; Capital markets; and Valuation and other, representing 59%, 23%, 12%, and 6% of our 2018 revenue and 44%, 32%, 16% and 8% of our 2018 Fee revenue, respectively.
Our Geographical Segments
Our global presence and integrated platform enables us to provide a broad base of services across geographies. We hold leading positions in all of our key markets. This global footprint, complemented with a full suite of service offerings, positions us as one of a small number of providers able to respond to complex global mandates from large multinational occupiers and owners.
By revenue, our largest country was the United States, representing 66%, 62% and 62% of revenue in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, followed by Australia, representing 7%, 10% and 10% of revenue in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Our Service Lines
Property, Facilities and Project Management. Our largest service line includes property management, facilities management, facilities services and project and development services. Revenues in this service line are recurring in nature, many through multi-year contracts with relatively high switching costs.
3

For occupiers, we offer integrated facilities management, project and development services, portfolio administration, transaction management and strategic consulting. These services are offered individually, or through our global occupier services offering, which provides a comprehensive range of bundled services resulting in consistent quality service and cost savings.
For owners, we offer a variety of property management services, which include client accounting, engineering and operations, lease compliance administration, project and development services and sustainability services.
In addition, we offer self-performed facilities services globally to both owners and occupiers, which include janitorial, maintenance, critical environment management, landscaping and office services.
Fees in this service line are primarily earned on a fixed basis or as a margin applied to the underlying costs. As such, this service line has a large component of revenue that consists of us contracting with third-party providers (engineers, landscapers, etc.) and then passing these expenses on to our clients.
Leasing. Our second largest service line, Leasing, consists of two primary sub-services: owner representation and tenant representation. In owner representation leasing, we typically contract with a building owner on a multi-year agreement to lease their available space. In tenant representation leasing, we are typically engaged by a tenant to identify and negotiate a lease for them in the form of a renewal, expansion or relocation. We have a high degree of visibility into Leasing services fees due to contractual renewal dates, leading to renewal, expansion or new lease revenue. In addition, Leasing fees are less cyclical as tenants needs to renew or lease space to operate in all economic conditions.
Leasing fees are typically earned after a lease is signed and are calculated as a percentage of the total value of payments over the life of the lease.
Capital Markets. We represent both buyers and sellers in real estate purchase and sales transactions and also arrange financing supporting purchases. Our services include investment sales and equity, debt and structured financing. Fees generated are linked to transactional volume and velocity in the commercial real estate market.
Our Capital markets fees are transactional in nature and generally earned at the close of a transaction.
Valuation and other. We provide valuations and advice on real estate debt and equity decisions to clients through the following services: appraisal management; investment management; valuation advisory; portfolio advisory; diligence advisory; dispute analysis and litigation support; financial reporting and property and/or portfolio valuation. Fees are earned on both a contractual and transactional basis.
Industry Overview and Market Trends
We operate in an industry where the increasing complexity of our clients’ real estate operations drives demand for high quality services providers. The sector is fragmented among regional, local and boutique providers. Industry sources estimate that the five largest global firms combined account for less than 20% of the worldwide commercial real estate services industry by revenue. According to industry research, the global commercial real estate industry is expected to grow at approximately 5% per year to more than $4 trillion in 2022, outpacing expected global gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth. The market for global integrated facilities management is expected to grow at approximately 6% per year from 2016 to 2025. Top global services providers, including Cushman & Wakefield, are positioned to grow Fee revenue at a rate faster than GDP as the industry continues to consolidate and evolve, secular outsourcing trends continue, and top firms increase their share of the market.
During the next few years, key drivers of revenue growth for the largest commercial real estate services providers are expected to include:
Occupier Demand for Real Estate Services. Occupiers are focusing on their core competencies and choosing to outsource commercial real estate services. Multiple market trends like globalization and changes in workplace strategy are driving occupiers to seek third-party real estate services providers as an effective means to reduce costs, improve their operating efficiency and maximize productivity. We believe large corporations generally prefer outsourcing to global firms with fully developed platforms that can provide all the commercial real estate services needed. Today, only three firms, including Cushman & Wakefield, are positioned to meet those expectations.

Institutional Investors Owning a Greater Proportion of Global Real Estate. Institutional owners, such as real estate investment trusts (known as REITs), pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and other financial entities, are acquiring more real estate assets and financing them in the capital markets.
Increased institutional ownership drives demand for services in three ways:

◦ | Increased demand for property management services - Institutional owners self-perform property management services at a lower rate than private owners, outsourcing more to services providers.


◦ | Increased demand for transaction services - Institutional owners execute real estate transactions at a higher rate than private owners.


◦ | Increased demand for advisory services - Because of a higher transaction rate, there is an opportunity for services providers to grow the number of ongoing advisory engagements.

Owners and Occupiers Continue to Consolidate Their Real Estate Services Providers. Owners and occupiers are consolidating their services provider relationships on a regional, national, and global basis to obtain more consistent execution across markets and to benefit from streamlined management oversight of “single point of contact” service delivery.
Global Services Providers Create Value in a Fragmented Industry. The global services providers with larger operating platforms can take advantage of economies of scale. Those few firms with scalable operating platforms are best positioned to drive profitability as consolidation in the highly fragmented commercial real estate services industry is expected to continue. 
Increasing Business Complexity Creates Opportunities for Technological Innovation. Organizations have become increasingly complex and are relying more heavily on technology and data to manage their operations. Large global commercial real estate services providers with leading technological capabilities are best positioned to capitalize on this technological trend by better serving their clients’ complex real estate services needs and gaining market share from smaller operators. In addition, integrated technology platforms can lead to margin improvements for the larger global providers with scale.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the growth and globalization trends in the commercial real estate services industry due to the following competitive strengths:
Global Size and Scale. We believe multinational clients prefer to partner with real estate services providers with the scale necessary to meet their needs across multiple geographies and service lines. Often, this scale is a pre- requisite to compete for complex global service mandates. We are one of three global real estate services providers able to deliver such services on a global basis. We have built a platform by investing in our people and technology to enable our approximately 51,000 employees to offer our clients services through an extensive network of approximately 400 offices across 70 countries. This scale provides operational leverage, translating revenue growth into increased profitability.
Breadth of Our Service Offerings. We offer our clients a fully integrated commercial real estate services experience across Property, facilities and project management, Leasing, Capital markets, and Valuation and other services. These services can be bundled into regional, national and global contracts and/or delivered locally for individual assignments to meet the needs of a wide range of client types. Regardless of a client’s assignment, we view each interaction with our clients as an opportunity to deliver an exceptional experience by offering a full platform of services, while deepening and strengthening our relationships.

Comprehensive Technology Strategy. Our technology strategy focuses on (i) delivering high-value client outcomes, (ii) increasing employee productivity and connectedness and (iii) driving business change through innovation. We have invested significantly in our technology platform over the last several years. This has improved service delivery and client outcomes. We have deployed enterprise-wide financial, human capital and client relationship management systems, such as Workday and Salesforce, to increase global connectivity and productivity. We are focused on innovative solutions that improve the owner or occupier experience. As we continue to drive innovation for our clients, we have created strategic opportunities and partnerships with leading technology organizations, start-ups and property technology firms (such as Metaprop NYC).
Our Iconic Brand. The history of our franchise and brand is one of the oldest and most respected in the industry. Our founding predecessor firm, DTZ, traces its history back to 1784 with the founding of Chessire Gibson in the U.K. Our brand, Cushman & Wakefield, was founded in 1917 in New York. Today, this pedigree, heritage and continuity of brand continues to be recognized by our clients, employees and the industry. Recently, Cushman & Wakefield was recognized in the top 2 by a leading industry ranking of the Top 25 Commercial Real Estate Brands. In addition, according to leading industry publications, we have held the top positions in real estate sectors like U.S. industrial brokerage, U.S. retail brokerage and U.K. office brokerage, and have been consistently ranked among the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals’, or IAOP, top 100 outsourcing professional service firms. In 2018, Forbes named Cushman & Wakefield on its list of America’s Best Large Employers and we were named the top CRE advisor in the world by Euromoney.
Significant Recurring Revenue Provides Durable Platform. In 2018, 88% of revenue and nearly 85% of Fee revenue was generated from service lines that have proven to be more resilient to changing economic conditions. Our Property, facilities and project management service line, which is recurring and contractual in nature, generated 59% of our revenue and 44% of our Fee revenue in 2018. Additionally, services with high visibility including our Leasing and Valuation and other service lines generated 29% of our revenue and 40% of our Fee revenue in 2018. These revenue streams have provided greater stability to our cash flows and underlying business.
Top Talent in the Industry. For years, our people have earned a strong reputation by successfully executing some of the most iconic and complex real estate assignments in the world. Because of this legacy of excellence, our leading platform and brand strength, we attract and retain some of the top talent in the industry. We provide our employees with training growth opportunities to support their ongoing success. In addition, we are focused on management development to drive strong operational performance and continuing innovation. The investment into our talent helps to foster a strong organizational culture, leading to employee satisfaction. This was confirmed recently when a global employee survey, which was benchmarked against other top organizations, showed our employees have a strong sense of pride in Cushman & Wakefield and commitment to our firm.
Capital-Light Business Model. We generate strong cash flow through our low capital intensive business model and focused and disciplined capital deployment. We target average capital expenditures to be less than 1% of revenue in the near to medium term. We expect to reinvest this cash flow into our services platform as well as infill M&A to continue to drive growth.
Best-In-Class Executive Leadership and Sponsorship. Our executive management team possesses a diverse set of backgrounds across complementary expertise and disciplines. Our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), Brett White, has more than 33 years of commercial real estate experience successfully leading the largest companies in our sector. John Forrester, our President, was previously the CEO of DTZ where he began his career in 1988. Our Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), Duncan Palmer, has held senior financial positions in global organizations across various industries over his career, including serving as CFO of Owens Corning and RELX Group.
TPG Global LLC (together with its affiliates, “TPG”), PAG Asia Capital ("PAG") and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board ("OTPP"), collectively referred to as our Principal Shareholders have supported our growth initiatives and have a proven track record of investing and growing industry-leading businesses like ours. As of December 31, 2018, our Principal Shareholders collectively held approximately 64% of our outstanding ordinary shares. This group of Principal Shareholders brings with them years of institutional investing and stewardship with deep knowledge and experience sponsoring public companies.

Our Growth Strategy
We have built an integrated, global services platform that delivers the best outcomes for clients locally, regionally and globally. Our primary business objective is growing revenue and profitability by leveraging this platform to provide our clients with excellent service. We are focused on executing the following strategies to support our growth objectives: 
Recruit, Hire and Retain Top Talent. We attract and retain high quality employees. These employees produce superior client results and position us to win additional business across our platform. Our real estate professionals come from a diverse set of backgrounds, cultures and expertise that creates a culture of collaboration and a tradition of excellence. We believe our people are the key to our business and we have instilled an atmosphere of collective success.
Expand Margins Through Operational Excellence. Our management team has driven integration benefits during the period of our ownership by the Principal Shareholders resulting in significant margin expansion through organic operational improvements, the successful realization of synergies from previous acquisitions and developing economies of scale. Adjusted EBITDA margins have expanded since our inception in 2014. We expect to continue to grow margin and view it as a primary measure of productivity.
Leverage Breadth of Services to Provide Superior Client Outcomes. Our current scale and position creates a significant opportunity for growth by delivering more services to existing clients across multiple service lines. Following the DTZ, Cassidy Turley and Cushman & Wakefield mergers, many of our clients realized more value by bundling multiple services, giving them instant access to global scale and better solutions through multidisciplinary service teams. As we continue to add depth and scale to our growing platform, we create more opportunities to do more for our clients, leading to increased organic growth.
Continue to Deploy Capital Around Our Infill M&A Strategy. We have an ongoing pipeline of potential acquisitions to improve our offerings to clients across geographies and service lines. We are highly focused on the successful execution of our acquisition strategy and have been successful at targeting, acquiring and integrating real estate services providers to broaden our geographic and specialized service capabilities. The opportunities offered by infill acquisitions are additive to our platform as we continue to grow our business. We expect to be able to continue to find, acquire and integrate acquisitions to drive growth and improve profitability, in part by leveraging our scalable platform and technology investments. Infill opportunities occur across all geographies and service lines and over time we expect to invest in acquisitions with recurring and more visible revenue streams.
Deploy Technology to Improve Client Experience. Through the integration of DTZ, Cassidy Turley and Cushman & Wakefield, we invested heavily in technology platforms, workflow processes and systems to improve client engagement and outcomes across our service offerings. The recent timeframe of these investments has allowed us to adopt best-in-class systems that work together to benefit our clients and our business. These systems are scalable to efficiently onboard new businesses and employees without the need for significant additional capital investment in new systems. In addition, our investments in technology have helped us attract and retain key employees, enable productivity improvements that contribute to margin expansion and strongly positioned us to expand the number and types of service offerings we deliver to our key global customers. We have made significant investments to streamline and integrate these systems, which are now part of a fully integrated platform supported by an efficient back- office.
Competition
We compete across a variety of geographies, markets and service lines within the commercial real estate services industry. Each of the service lines in which we operate is highly competitive on a global, national, regional and local level. While we are one of the three largest global commercial real estate services firms as measured by Fee revenue and workforce, our relative competitive position varies by geography and service line. Depending on the product or service, we face competition from other commercial real estate services providers, institutional lenders, in-house corporate real estate departments, investment banking firms, investment managers, accounting firms and consulting firms. Although many of our competitors across our larger service lines are smaller local or regional firms, they may have a stronger presence in certain markets. We are also subject to competition from other large national and multinational firms that have similar service competencies and geographic footprint to ours, including Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (NYSE:JLL) and CBRE Group, Inc. (NYSE: CBRE).

Corporate Information
DTZ Jersey Holdings Limited, our parent company prior to the restructuring, is a Jersey limited company that was formed in 2014 in connection with the purchase of DTZ from UGL Limited. On July 6, 2018, the shareholders of DTZ Jersey Holdings Limited exchanged their shares in DTZ Jersey Holdings Limited for interests in newly issued shares of Cushman & Wakefield Limited (the “Share Exchange”), a private limited company incorporated in England and Wales. On July 19, 2018, Cushman & Wakefield Limited re-registered as a public limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales (the “Re-registration”) named Cushman & Wakefield plc. On July 20, 2018, the Company undertook a share consolidation of its outstanding ordinary shares (the “Share Consolidation”), which resulted in a proportional decrease in the number of ordinary shares outstanding as well as corresponding adjustments to outstanding options and restricted share units (“RSUs”). On August 6, 2018, the Company closed the IPO of its ordinary shares.
Cushman & Wakefield plc does not conduct any operations other than with respect to its direct and indirect ownership of its subsidiaries, and its business operations are conducted primarily out of its indirect operating subsidiary, DTZ Worldwide Limited. Our corporate headquarters are located at 225 West Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois. Our website address is www.cushmanwakefield.com. The information contained on, or accessible through, our website is not part of or incorporated into this Form 10-K.
Our History
In 2014, our Principal Shareholders started our company in its current form, with the purchase of DTZ from UGL Limited. At the end of 2014, the Principal Shareholders acquired and combined Cassidy Turley with DTZ. Finally, in 2015, we completed our transformative growth with the acquisition of Cushman & Wakefield. The company was combined under the name Cushman & Wakefield in September 2015.
References in this Form 10-K to “DTZ” are to the DTZ Group legacy property services business of UGL Limited, acquired by our Principal Shareholders on November 5, 2014, references to “Cassidy Turley” are to the legacy Cassidy Turley companies, acquired by our Principal Shareholders and combined with us on December 31, 2014 and references to the “C&W Group” (or to “Cushman & Wakefield” where historical context requires) are to C&W Group, Inc., the legacy Cushman & Wakefield business, acquired by our Principal Shareholders and combined with us on September 1, 2015.
As part of the IPO we underwent a restructuring from our former holding company, a Jersey limited company, DTZ Jersey Holdings Limited, to a public limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales named Cushman & Wakefield plc.
Our Owner and Occupier Clients
Our clients include a full range of real estate owners and occupiers, including tenants, investors and multi- national corporations in numerous markets, including office, retail, industrial, multifamily, student housing, hotels, data center, healthcare, self-storage, land, condominium conversions, subdivisions and special use. Our clients vary greatly in size and complexity, and include for-profit and non-profit entities, governmental entities and public and private companies.
Seasonality
The market for some of our products and services is seasonal, especially in the Leasing and Capital markets service lines. Generally, our industry is focused on completing transactions by calendar year-end, with a significant concentration in the last quarter of the calendar year while certain expenses are recognized more evenly throughout the calendar year. Historically, our revenue and operating income tend to be lowest in the first quarter, and highest in the fourth quarter of each year. The Property, facilities and project management service line partially mitigates this intra-year seasonality, due to the recurring nature of this service line, which generates more stable revenues throughout the year. The seasonality of Fee revenue flows through to our net income and cash flow from operations.
Intellectual Property
We hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide, which include the “Cushman & Wakefield,” and “DTZ” names. Although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve, we do not believe we would be materially adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the “Cushman & Wakefield” name. We primarily operate under the “Cushman & Wakefield” name and have generally adopted a strategy of having our acquisitions transition to the “Cushman & Wakefield” name. We own 
8

numerous domain names and have registered numerous trademarks and/or service marks globally. With respect to the Cushman & Wakefield name, we have processed and continuously maintain trademark registration for this trade name in most jurisdictions where we conduct business. We obtained our most recent U.S. trademark registrations for the Cushman & Wakefield name and logo in 2017, and these registrations would expire in 2027 if we failed to renew them.
Executive Officers of the Registrant
See "Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance" in Part III.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 51,000 employees worldwide. Our employees include management, brokers, and other sales staff, administrative specialists, valuation specialists, maintenance, landscaping, janitorial and office staff and others.
Across our Property, facilities and project management, Leasing, Capital markets, and Valuation and other service lines, our employees are compensated in different manners in line with the common practice in their professional field and geographic region. Many of our real estate professionals in the Americas and in certain international markets work on a commission basis, particularly our Leasing and Capital markets professionals in the United States. Commissions are tied to the value of individual or team-based transactions and subject to fluctuation. Many of our similar real estate professionals in EMEA and Asia Pacific work on a salary basis, with an additional performance bonus based on a share of the profits of their business unit or team. Even within our geographic segments, our service lines utilize a varied mix of professional and non-salaried employees.
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 17% of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements, the substantial majority of whom are employees in facilities services, including janitorial, security and mechanical maintenance services. We consider relations with our employees to be good.
Regulation
The brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions, property and facilities management, conducting real estate valuation and securing debt for clients, among other service lines, require that we comply with regulations affecting the real estate industry and maintain licenses in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Like other market participants that operate in numerous jurisdictions and in various service lines, we must comply with numerous regulatory regimes.
A number of our services, including the services provided by certain of our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries in the U.S., U.K., France and Japan, are subject to regulation and oversight by the SEC, FINRA, the Defense Security Service, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (France), the Financial Services Agency (Japan), the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (Japan) or other self-regulatory organizations and foreign and state regulators, and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business. We could be required to pay fines, return commissions, have a license suspended or revoked or be subject to other adverse action if we conduct regulated activities without a license or violate applicable rules and regulations. Licensing requirements could also impact our ability to engage in certain types of transactions, change the way in which we conduct business or affect the cost of conducting business. We and our licensed associates may be subject to various obligations and we could become subject to claims by regulators and/or participants in real estate sales or other services claiming that we did not fulfill our obligations. This could include claims with respect to alleged conflicts of interest where we act, or are perceived to be acting, for two or more clients. While management has overseen highly regulated businesses before and expects us to comply with all applicable regulations in a satisfactory manner, no assurance can be given that it will always be the case. In addition, federal, state and local laws and regulations impose various environmental zoning restrictions, use controls and disclosure obligations that impact the management, development, use and/or sale of real estate. Such laws and regulations tend to discourage sales and leasing activities, as well as mortgage lending availability, with respect to such properties. In our role as property or facilities manager, we could incur liability under environmental laws for the investigation or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes relating to properties we currently or formerly managed. Such liability may be imposed without regard for the lawfulness of the original disposal activity, or our knowledge of, or fault for, the release or contamination.
Applicable laws and contractual obligations to property owners could also subject us to environmental liabilities through our provision of management services. Environmental laws and regulations impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at the property. As a result, we may be held liable as an operator for 
9

such costs in our role as an on-site property manager. This liability may result even if the original actions were legal and we had no knowledge of, or were not responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. Similarly, environmental laws and regulations impose liability for the investigation or cleanup of off-site locations upon parties that disposed or arranged for disposal of hazardous wastes at such locations. As a result, we may be held liable for such costs at landfills or other hazardous waste sites where wastes from our managed properties were sent for disposal. Under certain environmental laws, we could also be held responsible for the entire amount of the liability if other responsible parties are unable to pay. We may also be liable under common law to third parties for property damages and personal injuries resulting from environmental contamination at our sites, including the presence of asbestos-containing materials or lead-based paint. Insurance coverage for such matters may be unavailable or inadequate to cover our liabilities. Additionally, liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our service lines.
