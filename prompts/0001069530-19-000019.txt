 Overview
 ﻿
 Cassava Sciences, Inc. is a clinical-stage drug development company. Our expertise is to develop new product candidates and to guide these through various regulatory and development pathways in preparation for their potential commercialization. Since our inception, we have generally focused our drug development efforts on disorders of the central nervous system. We are currently conducting a Phase II clinical program for patients with Alzheimer’s disease.  By necessity, the conduct of drug development is complex, lengthy, expensive and risky. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has not yet established the safety or efficacy of our product candidates.
 ﻿
 Our overall strategy is to leverage our unique scientific/clinical platform to develop a first-in-class program for neurodegeneration.  Our goal is to address Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, particularly those with a strong neuroinflammation component, with PTI-125, our drug product candidate and a diagnostic product candidate, PTI-125Dx, to detect Alzheimer’s disease.  
 ﻿
 We seek to develop and gain regulatory approval for PTI-125 for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and PTI-125Dx for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.  The following is a summary of our clinical-stage biopharmaceutical assets:
 ﻿
 PTI-125 – PTI-125 is the name of our product candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.  This proprietary small molecule drug represents an entirely new target to treat Alzheimer’s disease.  PTI-125 benefits from a strong scientific rationale, peer-reviewed publications in prestigious academic journals and multiple peer-reviewed research grant awards from the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), the primary agency of the U.S. government for biomedical research.  
 ﻿
 In 2018, we initiated a Phase II clinical program in patients with Alzheimer’s disease using PTI-125.  Our Phase II clinical program with PTI-125 is substantially funded by research grant awards from the NIH.  PTI-125 was discovered and designed in-house and was characterized by our academic collaborators during research activities that were conducted from approximately 2008 to date.  We own exclusive, worldwide rights to PTI-125, without royalty obligations to any third party.
 ﻿
 PTI-125Dx – We are developing PTI-125Dx as a blood-based biomarker/diagnostic to detect Alzheimer's disease. The goal of PTI-125Dx is to make the detection of Alzheimer’s disease as simple as getting a blood test. This clinical-stage program is substantially funded by research grant awards from the NIH. PTI-125Dx was discovered and designed in-house and was characterized by our academic collaborators during research activities that were conducted from approximately 2008 to date.  We own exclusive, worldwide rights to PTI-125Dx, without royalty obligations to any third party.
 ﻿
 Our scientific approach is different.
 ﻿
 For over 100 years, scientists have ascribed various neurodegenerative diseases to pathological proteins that misfold.  Misfolded proteins are also altered or they aggregate, such as amyloid and tau in the case of Alzheimer’s disease. Destruction of neuronal synapses, accelerated nerve cell death, and dysfunction of the brain support cells, are all widely believed to be a direct consequence of misfolded proteins.    ﻿
 Historically, the drug industry has attempted to treat Alzheimer’s disease by developing drugs that block the synthesis of, or remove or dis-aggregate, beta amyloid and, more recently, tau. Essentially, the prevailing doctrine said that amyloid must be cleared out of the brain.  This scientific approach – known as the amyloid hypothesis - has been repeatedly tested by our competitors in late stage clinical trials using a variety of antibody backbones, epitopes, target conformations, biomarkers and in various stages of disease.  Such studies have all failed to yield therapeutic benefit for patients with Alzheimer’s disease.  More recently, experimental efforts have been proposed to ramp up the brain’s immune system in people with Alzheimer’s disease to remove amyloid or tau, an approach known as immunotherapy. Current attempts to use immunotherapy to treat

Alzheimer’s disease may yet work, but for over 20 years this approach has also consistently failed due to lack of efficacy and/or for safety reasons. For example, older adults who receive active immunotherapy treatment often show reduced responsiveness of the immune system, and patients who do improve sometimes develop a life-threatening brain inflammation called aseptic meningitis. More generally, even when active or passive immunization against amyloid beta has reduced the brain’s amyloid load, such effects resulted in no therapeutic benefit to patients with Alzheimer’s disease.
 ﻿
 Since drug innovation is a trial-and-error process, clinical failures represent important learning opportunities.  In the case of Alzheimer’s disease, we believe the biopharmaceutical industry’s track record of persistent failure reflects a need to consider more recent and innovative approaches regarding the neurobiology of Alzheimer’s disease. We believe such scientific approaches may broaden the range of possible treatment approaches. 
 ﻿
 Over the last ten years, we have developed a new and promising scientific approach for the treatment and diagnosis of neurodegeneration, particularly Alzheimer’s disease.  
 ﻿
 Importantly, we do not seek to clear amyloid out of the brain.  Our approach is to stabilize a critical protein in the brain.
 ﻿
 “Proteopathy” refers to a disease in which a protein becomes structurally abnormal, assembles and aggregates, and therefore loses its normal function and disrupts or injures the function of surrounding cells, tissues and organs.  Through years of basic research, we have identified a structurally altered protein in the brain. We believe our experimental evidence demonstrates that this proteopathy plays a critical role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including the neurodegeneration observed in Alzheimer’s disease.  Using scientific insight and advanced tools in biochemistry, bioinformatics and imaging, we have elucidated this protein dysfunction. We have engineered a family of high-affinity small molecules to target the structurally altered protein and restore the protein to its normal shape and function. This family of small molecules, including PTI-125, was designed in-house and characterized by our academic collaborators. 
 ﻿
 The target of PTI-125 is an altered form of a scaffolding protein called filamin A (“FLNA”). Altered FLNA causes a cascade of toxic effects in the brain.  Altered FLNA is a proteopathy, which means that this protein is no longer capable of executing a stable, beneficial and protective role and instead becomes harmful and destructive to the brain.  By reversing the alteration of FLNA, its pathology ceases to adversely affect surrounding cells in the brain. In animal models of disease, restoring normal FLNA resulted in a multitude of therapeutic effects, including normalizing neurotransmission, decreasing neuroinflammation and restoring memory and cognition. By restoring function to multiple receptors and exerting powerful anti-inflammatory effects, we believe our approach has potential to slow the progression of neurodegeneration in humans.  Thus, we have designed product candidates, such as PTI-125, with the goal of slowing or, potentially, even reversing the deterioration of brain cells. We believe the ability to simultaneously improve many vital functions in the brain represents a new, different and crucial approach to address neurodegeneration. 
 ﻿
 Importantly, since PTI-125 has a unique mechanism of action, we believe its potential therapeutic effects may be additive or synergistic with that of other therapeutic candidates aimed at the treatment of neurodegeneration.
 ﻿
 Our mission is to detect and treat Alzheimer’s disease. 
 ﻿
 Our lead therapeutic product candidate, called PTI-125, is initially aimed at Alzheimer’s disease.  PTI-125 is a small molecule drug with a novel mechanism of action.  This drug candidate has demonstrated both cognitive improvement and slowing of disease progression in animal models of disease.  PTI-125 is in Phase II clinical stage of development, with substantial support from the National Institute on Aging (“NIA”), a division of the NIH.
 ﻿
 The target of PTI-125 is an altered form of filamin A (“FLNA”).  FLNA is a scaffold protein that is widely found throughout the body.  The function of a scaffold protein is to bring multiple other proteins together for them to interact.  However, an altered, and highly toxic, form of FLNA is found in the Alzheimer’s brain. Altered FLNA contributes to Alzheimer’s disease by disrupting the normal function of neurons, leading to neurodegeneration and brain inflammation. Our product candidate, PTI-125, is aimed at countering the altered and toxic form of FLNA in the brain, thus restoring the normal function of this critical protein. 
 ﻿
 PTI-125 binds to altered FLNA with very high affinity.  In doing so, PTI-125 restores the normal shape of FLNA and the normal function of three brain receptors: the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; the N-methyl-D-aspartate (“NMDA”) receptor; and the insulin receptor.  These receptors have pivotal roles in brain cell survival, cognition and memory.  In animal 

     
6

models, treatment with PTI-125 resulted in dramatic improvements in brain health, such as reduced amyloid and tau deposits, improved insulin receptor signaling and improved learning and memory.  In addition, PTI-125 has another beneficial treatment effect of significantly reducing inflammatory cytokines in the brain. In animal models of disease, treatment with PTI-125 abolished IL-6 production and suppressed TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels by 86% and 80%, respectively, illustrating a powerful anti-neuroinflammatory effect.
 ﻿
 Our science is published in peer-reviewed academic journals.  In addition, our research has been supported by the NIH under multiple research grant awards. Each grant was awarded following an in-depth, competitive, peer-reviewed evaluation of our approach for scientific and technical merit by a panel of outside experts in the field.  Strong, long-term support from the NIH has allowed us to advance our two product candidates for neurodegeneration, PTI-125 and PTI-125Dx, into clinical development.
 ﻿
 Overview of Alzheimer’s disease.
 ﻿
 Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects cognition, function and behavior.  Most cases of Alzheimer’s disease are age-related.  Alzheimer’s disease has become markedly more common with the aging of the U.S. population.  Over 44 million individuals worldwide suffered from dementia in 2014, and approximately 34 million individuals are affected by Alzheimer's disease, according to Alzheimer's Disease International. The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease is widely expected to increase over time, with 13.8 million people age 65 and older projected to have the disease by 2050 in the U.S., up from 5.6 million in 2019. This projection does not include Alzheimer's disease patients under the age of 65, who currently account for approximately 3% of the overall Alzheimer's disease population according to the Alzheimer’s Association. 
 ﻿
 In addition to its debilitating effect on patients' cognition, memory and day-to-day functioning, Alzheimer's disease places a significant burden on the healthcare system. According to the Alzheimer's Association, the aggregate cost of care in 2018 for patients with Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia in the U.S. was estimated to be $234 billion, over half of which is borne by the Medicare system.  If the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease nearly triples in the U.S. between now and 2050, as is widely believed will happen, there is potential for the disease to cause a major financial drain on the national economy.
 ﻿
 Alzheimer's disease is often grouped into three categories based on severity: mild, moderate and severe. Although the relative prevalence of each of these categories is not well-defined in the literature, a report published by the Alzheimer's Society, a leading care and research charity in the United Kingdom for individuals and families that suffer from dementia, estimates that between 70% and 90% of all Alzheimer's disease patients age 65 and older have mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.
 ﻿
 Currently marketed drug therapies for Alzheimer’s disease are limited in scope and therapeutic effect.
 ﻿
 There are no disease-modifying drug therapies to treat Alzheimer’s disease.  The FDA has not approved any new drugs for Alzheimer’s disease since 2003. Currently marketed drug therapies focus solely on treating symptoms, mostly in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.  At the time of diagnosis, patients are initiated on a class of drugs called cholinesterase inhibitors. The Alzheimer’s brain has low levels of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. Cholinesterase inhibitors prevent an enzyme in the brain, called acetylcholinesterase, from breaking down acetylcholine. Currently marketed cholinesterase inhibitors include donepezil (marketed by Eisai Co., Ltd. and Pfizer, Inc. as Aricept®), rivastigmine (marketed by Novartis AG as Exelon®) and galantamine (marketed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as Razadyne®). Cholinesterase inhibitors may enhance cognition for some patients for several months, after which the targeted brain receptors are desensitized, and drug efficacy is lost. 
 ﻿
 Our science is based on stabilizing a critical protein in the brain.
 ﻿
 Our scientific approach is to treat neurodegeneration by targeting an altered form of a scaffolding protein called filamin A (“FLNA”).  Scaffolding proteins are essential for cell function because they participate in virtually every process within the cell.  If their function is impaired, the consequences can be devastating. Technological advances in medicine and improvements in lifestyle are making our lives longer.  But with age, genetic mutations and other factors conspire against healthy cells, resulting in altered proteins.  Sometimes a cell can rid itself of altered proteins. However, when disease changes the shape and function of critical proteins, multiple downstream processes are impaired.  There are many clinical conditions 

     
7

in which proteins become structurally altered and impair the normal function of cells, tissues and organs, leading to disease.   Conversely, restoring altered proteins back to health – which is called proteostasis – is a well-accepted therapeutic strategy in clinical medicine.
 ﻿
 Accumulation of altered proteins is common in age-related brain disorders.  The most common is Alzheimer’s disease.  Altered proteins observed in the aging brain include hyperphosphorylated tau and beta amyloid, both hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.  Our scientists and outside collaborators have demonstrated that an altered, and highly toxic, form of the scaffolding protein FLNA exists in the Alzheimer’s brain. Critically, altered FLNA enables the toxicity of both beta amyloid and tau proteins.  This toxic cascade impairs brain health, leading to worsening symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease over time.  In addition to impairing brain cell function, altered FLNA enables persistent inflammation in the Alzheimer’s brain. We have shown that altered FLNA also promotes neuroinflammation via toll-like receptor 4 (“TLR4”), an immune receptor that causes release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.  Our therapeutic approach is designed to counteract these brain pathologies by restoring altered FLNA protein back to its normal, non-diseased conformation with PTI-125.   Treatment with PTI-125 has been shown to restore the normal function of three brain receptors critical to brain cell survival, cognition and memory, i.e., the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; the NMDA receptor; and the insulin receptor. Treatment with PTI-125 has also been shown to dramatically reduce inflammatory cytokine levels in brains of mice with Alzheimer’s disease mutations, thus reducing the neuroinflammation that also characterizes Alzheimer’s disease.  
 ﻿
 PTI-125 is our proprietary drug for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
 ﻿
 We believe there is experimental evidence for improving brain health by restoring altered FLNA with PTI-125, our lead product candidate.  PTI-125 is a proprietary small molecule drug that represents an entirely new scientific approach to treat neurodegeneration.  Published studies have demonstrated that PTI-125 targets an altered form of a protein called FLNA that is widely found in the Alzheimer’s brain.  Altered FLNA causes neuronal dysfunction, neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation.  Our drug therapy, PTI-125, is aimed at countering the toxic shape of FLNA by reverting it back to its native, healthy confirmation.  Importantly, PTI-125 is not dependent on clearing amyloid from the brain.  The following is a summary profile of PTI-125.  
 ﻿
 IND submission to FDA.
 ﻿
  Over the past ten years, we successfully conducted basic research, and in vitro and preclinical studies in support of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) submission to the FDA for PTI-125, including requisite studies around safety pharmacology, genetic toxicology and bioanalytical methods.  In 2017 we filed an IND submission to the FDA for PTI-125.
 ﻿
 Clinical safety of PTI-125 in a Phase I study.
 ﻿
 Following FDA acceptance of our IND in 2017, we then investigated the safety, dosing and pharmacokinetic profile of PTI-125 in healthy human volunteers. The design of our first-in-human Phase I study was based on regulatory feedback, clinical and scientific rationale and observations from previously conducted preclinical and in vitro studies. In a Phase I study, PTI-125 was evaluated in 24 healthy human volunteers in a single-site in the U.S. for safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics. Study subjects were administered a single oral dose of 50, 100 or 200 mg of PTI-125.  The drug was well-tolerated.  Importantly, in this study PTI-125 showed no treatment-related adverse effects and no dose-limiting safety findings.  Pharmacokinetic measurements demonstrated that PTI-125, a small molecule, was rapidly absorbed, with no accumulation. Dose-proportionality outcomes were observed over the entire dose range of 50 to 200 mg.  Full results of this Phase I study were presented at the 10th Annual International Conference on Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease, in Boston, MA in 2017.  
 ﻿
 Given the absence of dose-limiting effects in healthy adults in a Phase I study, a strong scientific rationale, and multiple peer-reviewed publications and research grant awards, we believe this program demonstrated favorable proof-of-principle for the development of PTI-125 in Alzheimer’s disease. In 2018, we mapped out, in collaboration with outside science advisors and medical experts, a strategic clinical plan to advance PTI-125 into a comprehensive Phase II clinical development program.
 ﻿
 Phase II clinical development program for PTI-125.
 ﻿

The general objective of our Phase II program with PTI-125 is to gain an initial estimate of the safety, tolerability and biological activity of this drug candidate in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. We believe meaningful Phase II data may also enable us to seek one or more strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies.
 ﻿
 Our Phase II program for PTI-125 is staged in two parts.  In part one, we initiated a Phase IIa safety study in the fourth quarter of 2018. In part two, we expect to initiate a Phase IIb study in approximately the second half of 2019.
 ﻿
 The first part of our Phase II clinical development program consists of an open-label pharmacokinetics and safety study.  In this Phase IIa safety study, 12 patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease will be exposed to PTI-125 twice-daily over a continuous four-week period.  Certain pharmacokinetics parameters will be measured (e.g. half-life, clearance, peak and trough concentrations in blood, as well as the brain to blood ratio shortly after dosing). Additional clinical endpoints for our Phase IIa study include objective measurements of safety and tolerability and, potentially, confirmation of target engagement via certain biomarkers of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation consistent with Alzheimer’s disease.  
 ﻿
 The second part of our Phase II clinical development program consists of a randomized, placebo-controlled study.  In this Phase IIb study, 36 patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease will be either exposed to PTI-125 or a placebo twice-daily over a continuous three-month period.  The clinical endpoints for the Phase IIb study are objective measurements of safety and tolerability, and, potentially, confirmation of target engagement via relevant biomarkers of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, and cognitive testing. 
 ﻿
  By design, and based on feedback from our scientific collaborators, our Phase II program aims to enroll a limited number of patients (N=12 and N=36, for our Phase IIa study and Phase IIb study, respectively). Consequently, we do not expect our Phase II program to generate data that is generally considered ‘statistically significant’ (i.e., p<0.05) on parameters of interest.
 ﻿
 PTI-125Dx is our blood-based diagnostic to detect Alzheimer’s disease.
 ﻿
 Our initial diagnostic effort is focused on detecting Alzheimer’s disease from a small sample of blood, possibly years before the overt appearance of clinical symptoms.  The goal of PTI-125Dx is to make the detection of Alzheimer’s disease as simple as getting a blood test. We are developing PTI-125Dx as a fast, accurate and quantitative blood-based biomarker/diagnostic to detect and monitor Alzheimer's disease. If successful, we believe PTI-125Dx has potential to make obsolete many of the current approaches for diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. 
 ﻿
 Over the past ten years, we discovered that altered FLNA is a hallmark feature of brain pathology in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.  We believe PTI-125Dx, which is a complex and unique detection system for altered FLNA, can reveal early traces of the disease, potentially even before the overt appearance of disease symptoms, such as memory loss.  In September 2017, we announced a $1.8 million research grant award from the NIH for PTI-125Dx. The NIH awarded us this research grant following a confidential, competitive and in-depth evaluation of PTI-125Dx technology for scientific and technical merit.  This is a technical milestone-based grant award that will enable us to work collaboratively with leaders in the field to develop and test on clinical samples a blood-based diagnostic for Alzheimer’s disease.    
 ﻿
 A diagnostic, which is also sometimes also called a biomarker, is a measurement of a biological indicator of disease. A deep understanding of the biology of disease is required to identify and develop a diagnostic.  A valid diagnostic has certain baseline characteristics to be functional and useful for clinical practice.  It must detect disease in patients with disease and, conversely, not detect disease in healthy subjects; it must preferably be quantitative; and it must show some biological information related to disease.  Collectively, the ability to selectively detect disease indicators can be useful to provide diagnostic information (i.e., detect the disease) or prognostic information (i.e., predict the course of disease). 
 ﻿
 Currently, the most definitive method to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease is through autopsy after death, which is not particularly helpful.  Methods to detect Alzheimer’s disease in the living years may be expensive, invasive, subjective, risky or uncomfortable. Importantly, because of the expense and invasiveness of current tests, most people are not tested until they show obvious cognitive decline. Current approaches for diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease include measurement of amyloid-β (specifically, Aβ42), total tau (“T-tau”) or phosphorylated tau (“P-tau”) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (“CSF”); structural neuroimaging techniques, including magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) or computerized tomography (“CT”); positron-emission tomography (“PET”) imaging of brain amyloid (AmyVid®); and batteries of cognitive tests.  Usually, a combination of more than one test is often necessary to provide a working diagnosis.  When such tests and techniques are used in 

     
9

combination, the totality of data can be sensitive and specific for the detection of Alzheimer’s disease.  In practice, however, such tests and techniques are only used after the overt appearance of symptoms, such as memory loss.  
 ﻿
 We believe there is a profound need for a blood-based diagnostic test for Alzheimer’s disease.  A quick, simple, inexpensive test may provide advantages to the medical community and to society at large.  Advantages may include confirming the presence of Alzheimer’s disease when cognition is mildly impaired, or conversely, to rule out Alzheimer’s disease when memory loss occurs.  Other potential benefits include discriminating Alzheimer’s disease from other root causes of dementias; stratifying patients by stage of Alzheimer’s disease; selection and enrollment of the appropriate patients into studies with experimental product candidates; and better alignment of a patient’s specific diagnosis with a targeted therapeutic.  
 ﻿
 It is widely accepted that in Alzheimer’s disease, pathological changes in the brain occur at least 10-15 years before clinical symptoms become apparent.  These “pre-symptomatic” changes include depositions in the brain containing beta amyloid and tau.  Our long-term goal with PTI-125Dx is to identify people with Alzheimer’s disease, potentially long before clinical symptoms occur.  In such a case, it may then be possible to cease - or at least slow down - brain damage before it is too late.  Importantly, a non-invasive screen for latent Alzheimer’s disease prior to the appearance of symptoms could be conducted as a general health screen, not just in patients at risk by family history or in patients already showing cognitive impairment. Once a disease-modifying treatment is found, early detection will be important. Early detection may also enable the approval of a disease-modifying treatment, as some people believe one reason for clinical trial failures in Alzheimer’s disease is that treatment is started too late to make a difference in the course of the disease.
 ﻿
 Moreover, with repeat measurements over time, PTI-125Dx may provide a probability of cognitive decline or disease progression.  Even if PTI-125Dx does not provide a precise cutoff numerical value for Alzheimer’s disease, we believe it may be important to incorporate data from PTI-125Dx into the overall diagnostic framework for neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer’s disease.  As with any method of detecting disease, some people may embrace a way to detect Alzheimer’s disease long before clinical symptoms appear, while others may prefer not to know – at least until a treatment is found.

See “Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional details regarding our research and development activities.
 ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 The drug discovery and development industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize, such as PTI-125 or PTI-125Dx, may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 ﻿


     
11

Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, an established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing-approved products. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and technical personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring or developing technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 ﻿
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of PTI-125, and any other product candidates that we develop to address neurodegenerative disorders, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition, patience and physician acceptance and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. 
 ﻿
 Our competitors are large pharmaceutical companies that are developing product candidates for Alzheimer’s disease, including Eisai; Biogen; Eli Lilly; Janssen; Merck; Novartis; Allergan; Amgen; Roche; Genentech; and others.  Small to mid-size companies that are developing product candidates for Alzheimer’s disease are also a source of intense competition for us, including Alector, Inc; Alzheon, Inc.; AC Immune; Proclara Biosciences; Tau Rx Therapeutics; vTv Therapeutics; Avanir; AZTherapeutics; Axsome Therapeutics; Anavex Life Sciences; Charsire Biotechnology; Neurotrope Bioscience; Cognition Therapeutics; Cortexyme: M3 Biotechnology; NeuroTherapeia; PharmatrophiX; Tetra Discovery; Yumanity Therapeutics; and others.  Competing product candidates are in various stages of development, from pre-clinical research to Phase III. 
 ﻿
 In recent years, we have observed ramped-up worldwide efforts aimed at developing blood-based techniques to detect and monitor Alzheimer’s disease.  The key competitive factors affecting the success of PTI-125Dx, and any other product candidates that we develop to diagnose neurodegeneration, if approved, are likely to be their measure of accuracy, such as specificity and sensitivity, as well as their convenience, patience acceptance, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.  Our competitors in the diagnostic area are pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.  For example, in 2019, a team of researchers at King’s College (London, England) announced they had identified a panel of blood proteins that may identify asymptomatic patients who may be expected to develop neuropathology.  Also, in 2019, an international consortium of researchers led by the Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (Tubingen, Germany) published data showing that a protein called ‘neurofilament light chain’ may be a non-specific biomarker for neuropathology.  Also, in 2018, researchers at the Center for Development of Advanced Medicine for Dementia (Aichi Prefecture, Japan) announced that they had identified a panel of blood-based biomarkers that may help detect and monitor Alzheimer’s disease. Despite increased research effort, the field has generally been hampered by lack of reproducibility and an unclear path on how to move academic discoveries into clinical utilization.    ﻿
 In addition to blood-based techniques to detect Alzheimer’s disease, competitors are examining the use of novel tracing agents and imaging techniques to map the course of neurodegeneration.  In 2012 the FDA approved Amyvid® (Eli Lilly Pharmaceuticals), which is a radioactive diagnostic agent for brain imaging of amyloid plaque.  Amyvid's can rule out Alzheimer’s disease but does not confirm its presence.  That is, a negative scan means little or no plaque is present; however, a positive scan does not necessarily indicate Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, Amyvid cannot be used to stage Alzheimer’s disease because some people take years to show cognitive decline after amyloid plaque develops, while other others rapidly develop advanced Alzheimer’s disease within months. Amyvid has had modest clinical utilization due to its high cost, lack of reimbursement, need for specialized training, all of which resulting in the product making an overall limited contribution to a clinical diagnosis. Other companies that have announced development programs for new imaging techniques include 3SCAN, Inc. (San Francisco, CA), which uses detailed representations of anatomical structures to make non-invasive maps of the brain; Alzeca Biosciences, Inc. (Houston, TX), which employs targeted MRI agents to detect neurodegeneration; BioArtic AB (Stockholm, Sweden), which is studying the use of certain amyloid beta proteins to diagnose neurodegeneration; and others.   
 ﻿
 Manufacturing


     
12

﻿
 We do not own or lease any manufacturing facilities. We outsource formulation, manufacturing and related activities to third parties. For the foreseeable future, we will continue to rely on third parties to conduct certain quality control and assurance testing, shipping or storage of our product candidates.
 ﻿
 We currently rely on contract development and manufacturing organizations (“CDMOs”) for the manufacture of all our materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials and expect to continue to do so for preclinical studies, clinical trials, and for commercial supply of any product candidates that we may develop. We currently have established relationships with several CDMOs for the manufacturing of our product candidates.
 ﻿
 Our suppliers must comply with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) enforced by the FDA and other government agencies such as the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”). Our suppliers are subject to unannounced inspection by regulators, including pre-approval inspections by the FDA and the DEA, to ensure they are in strict compliance with government regulations and standards. Our suppliers may be forced to stop producing, storing, shipping or testing our drug products if they fall out of compliance with government regulations and standards. 
 ﻿
 We have no control over our suppliers’ compliance, or lack thereof, with the multitude of regulations and standards that affect our drug products. We cannot control decisions by our suppliers that affect their ability or willingness to continue to supply us on acceptable terms, or at all.    ﻿
 We may not be able to replace a commercial supplier on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Replacing any of our commercial suppliers will be expensive and time consuming. Further, if any of our product candidates are approved for commercialization, our suppliers may encounter difficulties in achieving high volumes of production to satisfy commercial demands. Failure by any of our suppliers to perform as expected could delay or prevent commercialization of our product candidates or result in shortages, cost overruns, or other problems and would materially harm our business.
 ﻿
 Strategic Shift Away from Analgesic Drug Development
 ﻿
 Historically, our focus was on analgesic drug development.  During that time, we conceived, formulated, developed, tested and patented various analgesic drug candidates with robust abuse-deterrent properties, including REMOXY® ER (extended-release oxycodone capsules CII) and FENROCK™ (transdermal fentanyl patch CII).
 ﻿
 In late 2018, we announced a strategic shift away from analgesic drug development.  In March 2019, we announced an intention to rebrand the Company around neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease.  Our rebranding plan includes a new company name, logo, NASDAQ ticker symbol and website.    ﻿
 On March 20, 2019, we gave Durect Corporation, a prior collaborator, written notice of termination of a licensing agreement for REMOXY.  This action effectively ends our development of REMOXY. We continue to conduct certain pre-clinical activities with FENROCK, a product candidate that we own without royalty obligations to any third-party.  Our FENROCK related activities are substantially funded by NIH.  Now that our primary focus on our product candidates for neurodegeneration, we anticipate providing updates regarding our activities on FENROCK only if and when material developments occur.
 ﻿
 Government Regulation 
 ﻿
 Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and diagnostic products. Generally, before a new drug or diagnostic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy and/or specificity must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. 
 ﻿
 U.S. Drug Development 
 ﻿
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). Both drugs and diagnostics also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the 

     
13

subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 ﻿
 Any future product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. The NDA process generally involves the following: 
    
· | Completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) or ethics committee before each trial may be initiated;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, code of good clinical practice (“cGCP”), requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------

  ﻿

· | A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for review;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Potential FDA audit of the preclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. 
 ﻿
 Preclinical Studies and IND 
 ﻿
 The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. As sponsor, we must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. 
 ﻿
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of 

     
14

preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including cGCP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.
 ﻿
 Clinical Trials 
 ﻿
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with cGCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. 
 ﻿
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA may accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with cGCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary. 
 ﻿
 Clinical trials in the U.S. generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase I, Phase II and Phase III, and may overlap. 
    
· | Phase I clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, tolerability and safety of the drug.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Phase II clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Phase III clinical trials generally involve many patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA. 
 ﻿
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA.  Written safety reports and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, or any other findings suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug must be submitted to the FDA.    ﻿


     
15

Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check-points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that our product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
     NDA Review Process
 ﻿
 Following completion of the clinical trials, data is analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. In short, the NDA is a request for approval to market a drug for one or more specified indication and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug’s purity and potency. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from several alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be marketed in the U.S.    ﻿
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fiscal year 2019 fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2019, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an NDA, is approximately $2.6 million. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 ﻿
 The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accept the NDA for filing. The FDA must decide on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular-entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular-entity NDA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
 ﻿
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA may conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities fully comply with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with cGCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel product candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the FDA’s review of the application is complete and the application cannot be approved in its present form. A CRL usually describes the specific 

     
16

deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The CRL may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase III clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all the deficiencies identified in the CRL, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
 ﻿
 Advertising and Promotion    ﻿
 The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct‑to‑consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry‑sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. None of our product candidates can be commercially promoted before receiving FDA approval.  After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for “off‑label” uses — that is, uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the drug’s labeling — because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off‑label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject us to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the HHS, as well as state authorities. This could subject us to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which we promote or distribute our product candidates.
 ﻿
 Post‑Approval Requirements
 ﻿
 After a product candidate receives regulatory approval, it is often subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, adverse event reporting and advertising, marketing and promotion restrictions. 
 ﻿
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post‑market testing, known as Phase 4 testing, or a REMS, or surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product that is also a known drug of abuse, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration subjects entities to periodic announced or unannounced inspections by the FDA or these state agencies, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. In addition, other regulatory actions may be taken, including, among other things, warning letters, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 
 ﻿
 The FDA may require post‑approval studies and clinical trials if the FDA finds that scientific data, including information regarding related drugs, deem it appropriate. The purpose of such studies would be to assess a known serious risk or signals of serious risk related to the drug or to identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk. The FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of a drug. 
 ﻿
 The Hatch‑Waxman Amendments    ﻿
 Orange Book Listing    ﻿
 In seeking approval for our product candidates through an NDA, we will be required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the drug product. Upon receiving regulatory approval, each of the patents listed in the application for this drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known 

     
17

as the “Orange Book”. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated NDA, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredient in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or efficacy of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 
 ﻿
 The ANDA applicant is required to make certain certifications to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method‑of‑use rather than make certifications concerning a listed method‑of‑use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
 ﻿
 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non‑patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. 
 ﻿
 Exclusivity    ﻿
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that relies on the FDA’s findings regarding that drug. A drug may obtain a three‑year period of exclusivity for a change to the drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the labeling or a new formulation, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or any Section 505(b)(2) NDA, if the supplement includes reports of new clinical trials (other than bioavailability clinical trials) essential to the approval of the supplement. 
 ﻿
 An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. 
 ﻿
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs    ﻿
 Generally, drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on data not developed by the applicant, such as the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy in the approval of a similar product or published literature in support of its application. 
 ﻿
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs may provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from clinical trials not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical trials of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional clinical trials or provide additional materials to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 


     
18

﻿
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. Therefore, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired; until any non‑patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired; and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. In the interim period, the FDA may grant tentative approval. Tentative approval indicates that the FDA has determined that the applicant meets the standards for approval as of the date that the tentative approval is granted. Final regulatory approval can only be granted if the FDA is assured that there is no new information that would affect final regulatory approval. As with traditional NDAs, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be eligible for three‑year marketing exclusivity, assuming the NDA includes reports of new clinical trials (other than bioavailability clinical trials) essential to the approval of the NDA. 
 ﻿
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information    ﻿
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA‑regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, clinical trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to post certain information regarding the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 
 ﻿
 DEA Regulatory Requirements
 ﻿
 Certain product candidates are regulated as a controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA.  CSA establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, exportation and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA regulates the handling of controlled substances through a closed chain of distribution. This control extends to the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging of a controlled substance in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.  
 ﻿
 Controlled substances under the CSA are subject to a high degree of regulation. Schedule II drugs are subject to the strictest requirements for registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting. Also, distribution and dispensing of these drugs are highly regulated. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription. 
 ﻿
 Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized. 
 ﻿
 The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA, for example distribution reports for Schedule II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special permits and notification requirements apply to imports and exports of narcotic drugs. 
 ﻿
 To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate administrative proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal 

     
19

proceedings. In addition, individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. We and our contract manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products. 
 ﻿
 Other Regulatory Requirements
 ﻿
 We may be subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including the Environmental Protection Act and the Clean Air Act. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of controlled materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, accidental contamination or injury from these materials may occur. In the event of such an occurrence, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources.
 ﻿
 We may also be subject to regulations under other federal, state, and local laws, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, national restrictions on technology transfer, and import, export, and customs regulations.  It is possible that any portion of the regulatory framework under which we operate may change and that such change could have a negative impact on our current and anticipated operations.  Failure to comply with these requirements could result, among other things, in suspension of regulatory approval, recalls, injunctions or civil or criminal sanctions.

 Third‑Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
 ﻿
 The commercial success of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third‑party payors at the federal, state and private levels. Third‑party payors include governmental programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care plans. These third‑party payors may deny coverage or reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part if they determine that our product candidates are not medically appropriate or necessary. Also, third-party payors attempt to control costs by limiting coverage through the use of formularies and other cost‑containment mechanisms and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. 
 ﻿
 Some third‑party payors also require pre‑approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost‑containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our approved product candidates to operate profitably.

 Reverse Stock Split
 ﻿
 On May 4, 2017, following stockholder approval, our board of directors (the “Board”) approved a reverse stock split at a ratio of 7-for-1. On May 4, 2017, we filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect the 7-for-1 reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock. The number of outstanding shares of common stock on the date of the reverse split was reduced from 46.1 million to 6.6 million shares. Our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market on a split-adjusted basis when the market opened for trading on May 10, 2017. As a result, all common stock share amounts included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been retroactively reduced by a factor of seven, and all common stock per share amounts have been increased by a factor of seven, with the exception of our common stock par value.
