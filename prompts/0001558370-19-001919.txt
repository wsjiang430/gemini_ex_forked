 Item 1. Business
 The Company is a bank holding company headquartered in New York, New York and registered under the Bank Holding Company Act (“BHC Act”). Through its wholly owned bank subsidiary, Metropolitan Commercial Bank (the “Bank” or “Metropolitan”), a New York state chartered bank, the Company provides a broad range of business, commercial and retail banking products and services to small businesses, middle-market enterprises, public entities and affluent individuals in the New York metropolitan area. The Company’s founding members, including the Chief Executive Officer Mark DeFazio, recognized a need in the New York metropolitan area for a solutions oriented, relationship bank focused on middle market companies and real estate entrepreneurs who require loans of $2 million to $20 million, which is a size often overlooked or deprioritized by larger financial institutions. The Bank was established in 1999 with the goal of helping these under-served clients build and sustain wealth. Its motto, “The Entrepreneurial Bank,” is a reflection of the Bank’s aspiration to develop a middle-market bank that shares the same entrepreneurial spirit of its clients. By combining the high-touch service and relationship-based focus of a community bank with the extensive suite of financial products and services offered by its largest competitors, Metropolitan is well-positioned to continue to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities available in the New York metropolitan area. In addition to traditional commercial banking products, the Company offers cash management and retail banking services, and serves as an issuing bank for third-party debit card programs nationwide. The Bank has developed various deposit gathering strategies, which generate the funding necessary to operate without a large bank franchise.
 These activities, together with six strategically located banking centers, generate a stable source of low cost core deposits and a diverse loan portfolio with attractive risk-adjusted yields. As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s assets, loans, deposits and stockholders’ equity totaled $2.18 billion, $1.87 billion, $1.66 billion and $264.5 million, respectively.
 As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to the supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”). The Company is required to file with the FRB reports and other information regarding its business operations and the business operations of its subsidiaries. As a state-chartered bank that is a member of the FRB, the Bank is subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)  regulations as well as primary supervision, periodic examination and regulation by the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYSDFS”) as the state regulator and by the FRB as its primary federal regulator.
 Emerging Growth Company Status
 The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), which was enacted in April 2012, has made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an Emerging Growth Company (“EGC”). The Company qualifies as an EGC under the JOBS Act.
 As an EGC, the Company is not required to, and does not hold stockholder votes to approve annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as “say-on-pay” votes) or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” votes). An EGC also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting, and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation. Finally, as an EGC, the Company has elected to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements on a delayed basis in the same manner as a private company.
 A company loses EGC status on the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year of the company during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the company pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933; (iii) the date on which such company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.05 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which such company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally, at least $700 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates).

 Amendments to the SEC’s Smaller Reporting Company Definition
 On June 28, 2018, the SEC adopted amendments to its regulations that raise the thresholds of which entities would be defined as a “smaller reporting company,” which permits scaled disclosure under Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X. The amendments to the smaller reporting company definition became effective on September 10, 2018. Under the new definition of “smaller reporting company,” a company with less than $250 million of public float will be eligible to provide scaled disclosures. Additionally, companies with less than $100 million in annual revenues and either no public float or a public float that is less than $700 million will also be eligible to provide scaled disclosures. Under the revised “smaller reporting company” definition, the Company would be permitted to provide scaled disclosure under Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X. 
 It is difficult at this time to predict whether the SEC may implement additional amendments to its regulations with respect to disclosure requirements and what effect, if any, those future regulations will have on the Company or the Bank.
 The Company has elected to take advantage of certain exemptions allowed as an EGC and smaller reporting company. In addition, the Company has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards as permitted by the JOBS Act.
 Available Information
 The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) maintains an internet site, http://www.sec.gov, that contains the Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments thereto, and other reports electronically filed with the SEC. The Company makes these documents filed with the SEC available free of charge through the Company’s website, www.metropolitanbankny.com, by clicking the Investor Relations tab and selecting “Annual Reports & SEC Filings.”     Market Area
 The Bank’s primary market consists of the New York metropolitan area, specifically Manhattan and the outer boroughs. This market is well-diversified and represents the largest market for middle market businesses in the country (defined as businesses with annual revenue of $5 million to $200 million). Middle-market businesses have changed in type, but not in substance, with respect to banking needs in recent decades following a commercial trend out of manufacturing and into services. Unlike other Metropolitan Statistical Areas (“MSA”), this has been to the advantage of the middle-market business community in the New York metropolitan area, which has continued to grow at a better than average pace relative to other metropolitan regions in the United States.
 The Bank operates six banking centers strategically located within close proximity to target clients. There are four banking centers in Manhattan, one banking center in Brooklyn, New York, and one banking center in Great Neck, Long Island. The 99 Park Avenue banking center, adjacent to the Company headquarters, is located at the center of one of the largest markets for bank deposits in the New York MSA due to the abundance of corporate and high net worth clients. The Manhattan banking centers are centrally located in the heart of neighborhoods strongly identified with specific business sectors, with which the Bank has a strong existing relationship. The Brooklyn banking center is in the active Boro Park neighborhood, which is home to many small and medium-sized businesses, and where several important existing lending clients live and work. The banking center in Great Neck, Long Island represents a natural extension of the Bank’s efforts to establish a physical footprint in areas where many of its existing and prospective commercial clients are located, and also serves as a central hub for philanthropic and community events.
 Competitors
 The bank and non-bank financial services industry in the Bank’s markets and surrounding areas is highly competitive. It competes with a wide range of regional and national banks located in its market areas as well as non-bank commercial finance companies on a nationwide basis. The Bank faces competition in both lending and attracting funds as well as merchant processing services from commercial banks, savings associations, credit unions, consumer finance

companies, pension trusts, mutual funds, insurance companies, mortgage bankers and brokers, brokerage and investment banking firms, non-bank lenders, government agencies and certain other non-financial institutions. Many of these competitors have higher lending limits, more assets, capital and resources than the Bank, and may be able to conduct more intensive and broader-based promotional efforts to reach both commercial and individual customers. Competition for deposit products can depend heavily on pricing because of the ease with which customers can transfer deposits from one institution to another.
 The Bank’s primary market areas are the borough of Manhattan in New York City and Nassau County, New York. The Bank’s market area has a diversified economy typical of most urban population centers, with the majority of employment provided by services, wholesale/retail trade, finance/insurance/real estate (“FIRE”) and construction. The services industry accounts for the largest employment sector across the two primary market area counties, while wholesale/retail trade accounts for the second largest employment sector in Nassau and New York Counties. New York City is one of the premier financial centers in the world, and thus FIRE is the third largest employment sector in New York County.
 Accessibility, tailored product offerings, disciplined underwriting and differentiated execution create a unique opportunity for the Bank to distinguish itself in the market of its target clients, which the Bank views as under-served by today’s global financial services industry. Establishing banking centers in close proximity to a “critical mass” of its clients has advanced the Bank’s ability to retain and grow deposits, provided opportunities to deepen client relationships, and enhance franchise value. As a result, each of the six banking centers achieved break-even profitability within the first full year of operations.
 Business Strategy
 The Bank’s strategy is to continue to build a relationship-oriented commercial bank through organically growing its existing client relationships and developing new long-term clients. It focuses on New York metropolitan area middle-market businesses with annual revenue of $200 million or less and New York metropolitan area real estate entrepreneurs with a net worth of $5 million or more. The Bank originates and services Commercial Real Estate (“CRE”) and Commercial and Industrial (“C&I”) loans of generally between $2 million and $20 million, which it believes is an under-served segment of the market. Management believes that the Bank is positioned in a market area offering significant growth opportunities. As it grows, the Bank plans to continue its success in converting many of its lending clients into full retail relationships. 
 The Bank differentiates itself in the marketplace by offering excellent service, competitive products, innovative solutions, access to senior management, and an ability to make lending decisions in a timely manner combined with certainty of execution. The Bank’s lending team has developed industry expertise that enables it to better understand its clients’ businesses and differentiates it from other banks in the market. 
 On-going relationships and tailored products
 The Bank’s primary goal is to help clients build and sustain wealth. Management believes that the focus on servicing all aspects of the clients’ businesses, including cash management and lending solutions, positions the Bank to be able to provide a host of services designed to meet their current and future needs. The Bank has the flexibility and commitment to create solutions tailored to the needs of each client. For example, the Bank entered the healthcare lending space in 2001 and methodically built out processes, procedures, and customized infrastructure to support its clients in this vertical. Management intends to continue leveraging the quality of its team, existing relationships and client-centered approach to further grow its tailored banking solutions, build deeper relationships and increase penetration in its market area. Additionally, the Bank is always working to improve its team by attracting and developing individuals that embody its spirit as “The Entrepreneurial Bank.” This ensures that it continues to meet its high standard of excellence, which drives relationships and loan growth.

 Strong deposit franchise
 The strength of the Bank’s deposit franchise comes from its long-standing relationships with clients and the strong ties it has in its market area. The Bank provides commercial clients with convenient solutions such as remote deposit capture, business online banking and various other retail services and products. The Bank expects to continue its success of converting lending clients into full retail clients and strategically expand its retail presence.
 The Bank’s third-party debit card issuing business is the other major source of deposits. It is expected that the third-party debit card issuing business will continue to be a source of low-cost deposits. Additionally, the Bank expects to continue to add new clients to its programs. The third-party debit card issuing business brings a source of fee income in addition to low cost deposits.
 The Bank also provides banking services to customers in the digital currency business. The banking services are primarily deposit products and cash management services. The Bank does not have any digital assets or liabilities on its balance sheet and does not take any digital currency exchange rate risk.
 Products and Services
 The Bank provides a comprehensive set of commercial and retail banking products and services customized to meet the needs of its clients. The Bank offers a broad range of lending products, primarily focused on CRE and C&I loans and also serves as an issuing bank for third-party debit card programs nationwide. Lending Products
 The Bank’s CRE products include acquisition loans, loans to refinance or return borrower equity on income producing properties, renovation loans, loans on owner occupied properties and construction loans. The Bank lends against a variety of asset classes, including multi-family, mixed use, retail, office, hospitality and warehouse. 
 The Bank’s C&I products consist primarily of working capital lines of credit secured by business assets, self-liquidating term loans generally made for acquisition of equipment and other long-lived company assets, trade finance and letters of credit. The majority of C&I loans carry the personal guarantee of the principals in the borrowing entity.
 All loans with a total relationship exposure of over $7.5 million go to Loan Committee for approval. The Loan Committee is comprised of Board members and does not include members of management. There are four Board members who are permanent members of the Loan Committee; and a minimum of two other Board members rotate quarterly. Loans with a total relationship of less than $7.5 million are approved by management subject to individual officer approval limits.ff
 Commercial Real Estate
 Non-owner occupied CRE comprises the largest component of the Bank’s real estate loan portfolio. These mortgage loans are secured by mixed-use properties, office buildings, commercial condominium units, retail properties, hotels and warehouses. In underwriting these loans, the Bank generally relies on the income that is to be generated by the property as the primary means of repayment. However, the personal guarantee of the principals will frequently be required as a credit enhancement, particularly when the collateral property is in transition (i.e., under renovation and/or in the lease-up stage).
 Loans are generally written for terms of three to five years, though loans with longer terms are occasionally written. Interest rates may be fixed or floating, and repayment schedules are generally based on a 25 to 30 year amortization schedule although interest only loans are also offered.
 Factors considered in the underwriting include: the stability of the projected cash flow from the real estate based on operating history, tenancy, and current rental market conditions; development and property management experience of the principals; financial wherewithal of the principals, including an analysis of global cash flow; and credit history of the

principals. Maximum loan to value ratios range from 50% to 75%, depending on the property type. The minimum debt coverage ratio is 1.20x, with higher coverage required for hospitality and special use properties.
 A Phase I Environmental Report is generally required for all new CRE loans.
 Multi-family
 The multi-family loan portfolio consists of loans secured by multi-tenanted residential properties located in the New York City (“NYC’’) or greater New York area. 
 In underwriting multi-family loans, the Bank employs the same underwriting standards and procedures as are employed for non-owner occupied CRE. 
 Construction Loans
 Construction lending involves additional risks when compared to permanent loans. These risks include completion risk, which is impacted by unanticipated delays and/or cost overruns; and market risk, i.e., the risk that market rental rates and/or market sales prices may decline before the project is completed. Therefore, only on a very selective basis will the Bank originate construction loans. In most cases these loans are extensive renovation loans as opposed to ground up construction. However, from time to time the Bank will originate a ground up construction loan. In all cases the owner/developer will have extensive construction experience in building this type of property, sufficient equity in the transaction (maximum loan to cost of 65%) and personal recourse on the loan. The Bank has established conservative exposure targets as a percentage of risk based capital for construction lending. Commercial and Industrial Loans
 C&I credit facilities are made to a wide range of industries. The principals of the companies have extensive experience in acquiring and operating their business. The industries include retail, wholesale and importers and exporters of a wide range of products. The loans are secured by the assets of the company including accounts receivable, inventory and equipment and in almost all cases are personally guaranteed. Collateral may also include owner-occupied real estate. The Bank targets companies that have $200 million of revenues or less.
 The Bank’s lines of credit are generally renewed on an annual basis, and its term loans typically have terms of two to five years. The credit facilities may be made with either fixed or floating rates.
 C&I loans are subject to risk factors that are unique to each business. In underwriting these loans the Bank seeks to gain an understanding of each client’s business in order to accurately assess the reliability of the company’s cash flow. The Bank prefers to lend to borrowers who are well capitalized, and have an established track record in their business, with predictable growth and cash flow.
 Within the C&I lending group, the Bank has lenders who are well experienced in lending to the healthcare industry, and particularly to skilled nursing homes. They generally originate loans with very experienced operators who have a significant number of beds under management. In all cases these loans are secured by the assets of the operating company, and in almost all cases the credit facilities are personally guaranteed by principals of the company, who are typically high net worth individuals. The Bank also originates term loans to standalone medical facilities such as radiology and dialysis centers and medical practices, which are secured by the assets of the company and the personal guaranty of the physicians within the practice.
 At December 31, 2018, approximately 48% of the Bank’s commercial loan portfolio consisted of loans to the healthcare industry. Approximately 23% of these loans were made to nursing and residential care facilities. These loans are made to borrowers with strong cash flows and the Bank generally obtains the personal guarantee of high net worth sponsors.

 Consumer Loans
 The Bank purchases consumer loans nationwide through a physician-focused finance company. The loans are made only to healthcare professionals who meet specific credit criteria and all loans are independently underwritten by the Bank. The Bank also purchases consumer loans from a regional bank that offers student loan refinancing to individuals who are no longer students, but are now employed in their chosen professions. These individuals must also meet high credit standards and the Bank independently re-underwrites these loans. At December 31, 2018, consumer loans comprised 6% of the Bank’s entire loan portfolio. Beginning in 2019, the Bank has decided to no longer purchase or originate consumer loans; however, this may change in the future.  Deposit Products and Services
 The Bank’s retail products and services are similar to those of mid-to-large competitive banks in its market, and include, but are not limited to: online banking, mobile banking, ACH, and remote deposit capture. The Bank has and will continue to make investments in technology to meet the needs of its customers. 
 Third-party debit card issuing business
 Third-party debit cards and mobile services are unique and practical solutions for almost any payment need. Third-party debit cards provide a transparent, cost-effective alternative to cash and checks for governments and businesses, as well as individuals. It democratizes electronic payments for those individuals or financial technology companies that operate outside the traditional banking system and also serves the needs of customers who find it an ideal payment tool for segmenting their spending such as travel and online shopping.
 The Bank serves as an issuing bank for third-party debit card programs nationwide. Products include General Purpose Reloadable cards (“GPR”), payroll, corporate, incentive, commission, rebates and gift cards. The Bank is one of the few U.S. banks that issues debit cards for third-party program managers and there is a high bar for entry in this space due to the rigorous risk management and compliance requirements.
 In 2004, the Bank issued its first self-branded GPR debit card, the CashZone Debit Visa Card, which helped unbanked and underbanked families in the New York metropolitan area have access to financial services. Since 2004, the Bank has continued to provide self-branded third-party debit cards, as well as serve as an issuing bank for third-party debit card programs nationwide.
 Funding Strategies
 Over the past several years, the Bank has developed a diversified funding strategy, which affords it the opportunity to be a branch-light institution. Deposit funding is provided by the following deposit verticals:
1) | Borrowing clients – the Bank generates significant low cost deposits from its borrowing clients.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Non-borrowing retail clients – these customers, located primarily in NYC metro area, need an efficient technology interface and the personal service of an experienced banker who can assist them in managing their day to day operations. Management believes that not every potential client of the Bank is in need of extensions of credit; instead these clients require a bank that reduces or eliminates the friction experienced in running their businesses in order to make them more efficient and competitive.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Third-party debit card issuing business – the Bank entered into this business in 2004 and it has provided the Bank with significant zero-cost long-term deposits.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | Government or state directed funds, which provide further diversification of the deposit base.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5) | Digital currency customers – the Bank provides these customers with a suite of cash management solutions including wire transfers, ACH and foreign exchange conversion.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In determining the retail services it provides, the Bank’s entrepreneurial approach has required management to think of alternatives to traditional retail bank services.
 Digital Currency Customers
 As part of the Bank’s diversified approach to generating deposits, it has relationships with various digital currency customers. The Bank provides cash management solutions to its customers, including digital currency exchange customers. The funds deposited by these customers are denominated in U.S. dollars, and not digital currency. The Bank maintains a robust risk management program that is designed to ensure safe and sound operations in compliance with applicable laws, rules and guidance.
 Customers maintain a portion of these deposits in non-interest bearing settlement accounts with the Bank, while the rest are in corporate non-interest bearing accounts. The Bank uses the funds in the corporate accounts to fund its normal course of business. The Bank has developed policies to determine the portion of funds that are in settlement accounts that may be used as part of the Bank’s funding strategies. The remainder of the balance of settlement accounts are kept in overnight funds with the FRB. 
 At December 31, 2018, aggregate deposits related to digital currency customers amounted to $240.1 million. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had total deposits of $1.66 billion. At December 31, 2018, balances related to digital currency customers represented approximately 14.4% of its total deposit base. 
 Asset Quality
 Non-Performing Assets
 Non-performing assets consist of non-accrual loans, non-accrual troubled debt restructurings, loans past due 90 days and still accruing and other real estate owned that has been acquired in partial or full satisfaction of loan obligations or upon foreclosure. Past due status on all loans is based on the contractual terms of the loan. It is generally the Bank’s policy that a loan 90 days past due be placed in non-accrual status unless factors exist that would eliminate the need to place a loan in this status. A loan may also be designated as non-accrual at any time if payment of principal or interest in full is not expected due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower. At the time loans are placed in non-accrual status, the accrual of interest is discontinued and previously accrued interest is reversed. All payments received on non-accrual loans are applied to principal. Loans are considered for return to accrual status when they become current as to principal and interest and remain current for a period of six consecutive months or when, in the opinion of management, the Bank expects to receive all of its original principal and interest.  Troubled Debt Restructurings
 The Bank works closely with borrowers that have financial difficulties to identify viable solutions that minimize the potential for loss. In that regard, the Bank modified the terms of certain loans to maximize their collectability. The modified loans generally are considered troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) under current accounting guidance. Modifications generally involve short-term deferrals of principal and/or interest payments, reductions of scheduled payment amounts, interest rates or principal of the loan, and forgiveness of accrued interest. Impaired Loans
 A loan is classified as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect both the principal and interest due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
 The majority of the Bank’s impaired loans are secured and measured for impairment based on collateral valuations. It is the Bank’s policy to obtain updated appraisals, by independent third parties, on loans secured by real estate at the time a loan is determined to be impaired. An impairment measurement is performed based upon the most recent appraisal on file to determine the amount of any specific allocation or charge-off. In determining the amount of any specific allocation or charge-off, the Bank will make adjustments to reflect the estimated costs to sell the collateral. 

 
  9

 
Upon receipt and review of the updated appraisal, an additional measurement is performed to determine if any adjustments are necessary to reflect the proper provisioning or charge-off. Impaired loans are reviewed on a quarterly basis to determine if any changes in credit quality or market conditions would require any additional allocation or recognition of additional charge-offs. Real estate values in the Bank’s market area have been holding steady. Non-real estate collateral may be valued using (i) an appraisal, (ii) net book value of the collateral per the borrower’s financial statements, or (iii) accounts receivable aging reports, that may be adjusted based on management’s knowledge of the client and client’s business. If market conditions warrant, future appraisals are obtained for both real estate and non-real estate collateral.
 Allowance for Loan Losses
 The Allowance for Loan Losses (“ALLL”) is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable incurred losses on existing loans. The allowance is established based on management’s evaluation of the probable incurred losses inherent in the Bank’s portfolio in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), and is comprised of both specific valuation allowances and general valuation allowances.
 A loan is classified as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect both the principal and interest due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Specific valuation allowances are established based on management’s analysis of individually impaired loans. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, evaluations of the underlying collateral, expected cash flows, delinquent or unpaid property taxes, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. If a loan is determined to be impaired and is placed on non-accrual status, all future payments received are applied to principal and a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported, net, at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan’s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from sale of the collateral.
 The general component of ALLL covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current qualitative factors. Loans not impaired but classified as substandard and special mention use a historical loss factor on a rolling five-year history of net losses. For all other unclassified loans, the historical loss experience is determined by portfolio class and is based on the actual loss history experienced by the Bank over the most recent two years. This actual loss experience is supplemented with other qualitative factors based on the risks present for each portfolio class. These qualitative factors include consideration of the following: (1) lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery policies, (2) national and local economic and business conditions and developments, including the condition of various market segments, (3) loan profiles and volume of the portfolio, (4) the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and staff, (5) the volume and severity of past due, classified and watch-list loans, non-accrual loans, troubled debt restructurings, and other modifications (6) the quality of the Bank’s loan review system and the degree of oversight by the Bank’s Board of Directors, (7) collateral related issues: secured vs. unsecured, type, declining valuation environment and trend of other related factors, (8) the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations, (9) the effect of external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements, on the level of estimated credit losses in the Bank’s current portfolio and (10) the impact of the global economy.
 The allowance for loan losses is increased through a provision for loan losses charged to operations. Loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectability of all or a portion of the principal is unlikely. Management’s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is performed on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration such factors as the credit risk grade assigned to the loan, historical loan loss experience and review of specific impaired loans. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank’s allowance for loan 

 
  10

 
losses. Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
 The Bank controls credit risk both through disciplined underwriting of each transaction, as well as active credit management processes and procedures to manage risk and minimize loss throughout the life of a transaction. It seeks to maintain a broadly diversified loan portfolio in terms of type of customer, type of loan product, geographic area and industries in which business customers are engaged. The Bank has developed tailored underwriting criteria and credit management processes for each of the various loan product types it offers customers.
 Credit Risk Management
 Underwriting
 In evaluating each potential loan relationship, the Bank adheres to a disciplined underwriting evaluation process including but not limited to the following:

· | understanding the customer’s financial condition and ability to repay the loan;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | verifying that the primary and secondary sources of repayment are adequate in relation to the amount and structure of the loan;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | observing appropriate loan to value guidelines for collateral secured loans;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | identifying the customer’s level of experience in their business;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | maintaining targeted levels of diversification for the loan portfolio, both as to type of borrower and geographic location of collateral; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ensuring that each loan is properly documented with perfected liens on collateral.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Credit Risk Management for Lending Products
 Credit Risk Management strategies for specific lending products are outlined in the “Lending Products” section above.
 Loan Approval Authority
 The Bank’s lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by its Board of Directors and management. The Bank has established several levels of lending authority that have been delegated by the Board of Directors to the Loan Committee and other personnel in accordance with the Lending Authority in the Loan Policy. Authority limits are based on the individual loan size and the total exposure of the borrower and are conditioned on the loan conforming to the policies contained in the Loan Policy. Any Loan Policy exceptions are fully disclosed to the approving authority. Loans to One Borrower
 In accordance with loans-to-one-borrower regulations promulgated by the NYSDFS, the Bank is generally limited to lending no more than 15% of its unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus to any one borrower or borrowing entity. This limit may be increased by an additional 10% for loans secured by readily marketable collateral having a market value, as determined by reliable and continuously available price quotations, at least equal to the amount of funds outstanding. To qualify for this additional 10% the bank must perfect a security interest in the collateral and the collateral must have a market value at all times of at least 100% of the loan amount that exceeds 15% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. At December 31, 2018, the Bank’s regulatory limit on loans-to-one borrower was $45.0 million.

 
  11

 

 Management understands the importance of concentration risk and continuously monitors the Bank’s loan portfolio to ensure that risk is balanced between such factors as loan type, industry, geography, collateral, structure, maturity and risk rating, among other things. The Bank’s Loan Policy establishes detailed concentration limits and sub-limits by loan type and geography.
 Ongoing Credit Risk Management
 In addition to the underwriting process described above, the Bank performs ongoing risk monitoring and reviews processes for all credit exposures. Although it grades and classifies its loans internally, the Bank has an independent third-party firm perform regular loan reviews to confirm loan classifications. The Bank strives to identify potential problem loans early in an effort to aggressively seek resolution of these situations before the loans create a loss, record any necessary charge-offs promptly and maintain adequate allowance levels for probable loan losses incurred in the loan portfolio.
 In general, whenever a particular loan or overall borrower relationship is downgraded to pass-watch, special mention or substandard based on one or more standard loan grading factors, the Bank’s credit officers engage in active evaluation of the asset to determine the appropriate resolution strategy. Management regularly reviews the status of the watch list and classified assets portfolio as well as the larger credits in the portfolio.
 Investments
 The Bank’s investment objectives are primarily to provide and maintain liquidity, establish an acceptable level of interest rate risk and safely invest excess funds when demand for loans is weak. Subject to these primary objectives, the Bank also seeks to generate a favorable return. The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the investment portfolio, including approval of the Investment Policy. The Asset Liability Committee (“ALCO”) and management are responsible for implementation of the Bank’s investment policy and monitoring its investment performance. The Board of Directors reviews the status of its investment portfolio quarterly.
 The Bank has legal authority to invest in various types of investment securities and liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored agencies, mortgage-backed and municipal government securities, deposits at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLBNY” or “FHLB”), certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions, investment grade corporate bonds and investment grade money market mutual funds. It is also required to maintain an investment in FHLBNY stock, which investment is based primarily on the level of its FHLBNY borrowings. Additionally, the Bank is required to maintain an investment in Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“FRBNY”) stock equal to six percent of its capital and surplus.
 The large majority of its investments are classified as available-for-sale and can be used to collateralize FHLBNY borrowings, FRB borrowings, public funds deposits or other borrowings. At December 31, 2018, the investment portfolio consisted primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities, residential collateralized mortgage obligations, CRA mutual funds and municipal bonds. While the Bank has the authority under applicable law to enter into certain derivatives transactions, it did not enter into any derivatives transactions during 2018.
 Sources of Funds
 Deposits
 Deposits have traditionally been the Bank’s primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. The Bank generates deposits from prepaid third-party debit card programs, digital currency customers, its cash management platform offered through various deposit verticals, local businesses, individuals through client referrals and other relationships and through its retail branch network. The Bank believes that it has a very stable deposit base as it successfully encourages its business borrowers to maintain their operating banking relationship with it. The Bank’s deposit strategy primarily focuses on developing borrowing and other service oriented relationships with customers rather than competing with other institutions on rate. It has established deposit concentration thresholds to avoid the possibility of dependence on any single depositor base for funds.

 Borrowings
 The Bank maintains diverse funding sources including borrowing lines at the FHLB and the FRB discount window. The Bank utilizes advances from the FHLB to supplement its funding sources. The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for its member financial institutions. As a member, the Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLB and is authorized to apply for advances collateralized by the security of such stock and certain of its whole first mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the full faith and credit of the United States), provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution’s net worth or on the FHLB’s assessment of the institution’s creditworthiness. The FRB discount window is maintained primarily for contingency funding sources. Personnel
 As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had 153 full-time employees, none of whom are represented by a collective bargaining unit. The Company believes that it has a good working relationship with its employees. Subsidiaries
 Metropolitan Commercial Bank is the sole subsidiary of Metropolitan Bank Holding Corp. and there are no subsidiaries of Metropolitan Commercial Bank.
 Legal Proceedings
 The Company is subject to certain pending and threatened legal actions that arise out of the normal course of business. Management, following consultation with legal counsel, does not expect the ultimate disposition of any or a combination of these matters to have a material adverse effect the Bank. However, given the nature, scope and complexity of the extensive legal and regulatory landscape applicable to its business (including laws and regulations governing consumer protection, fair lending, fair labor, privacy, information security and anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws), the Bank, like all banking organizations, is subject to heightened legal and regulatory compliance and litigation risk. Properties
 The Company believes that current facilities are adequate to meet its present and foreseeable needs, subject to possible future expansion, particularly at the Company’s headquarters located at 99 Park Avenue, New York, New York. For more information on properties of the Company, see “Item 2 – Properties” of this Form 10-K.  Federal, State and Local Taxation
 The following is a general description of material tax matters and does not purport to be a comprehensive review of the tax rules applicable to the Company.
 For federal income tax purposes, the Company files a consolidated income tax return on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting. The Company is subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations. For its 2018 taxable year, the Bank is subject to a maximum Federal income rate of 21%.
 On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act included significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system including a federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company recorded additional tax expense of approximately $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities relating to this reduction in the corporate rate.

 State and Local Taxation
 The Company is subject to New York State (“NYS”) and New York City (“NYC”) income taxes on a consolidated basis.
 REGULATION
 General
 The Bank is a commercial bank organized under the laws of the State of New York. It is a member of the Federal Reserve System and its deposits are insured under the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC up to applicable legal limits. The lending, investment, deposit-taking, and other business authority of the Bank is governed primarily by state and federal law and regulations and the Bank is prohibited from engaging in any operations not authorized by such laws and regulations. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by, and the enforcement authority of, the NYSDFS and FRB, and to a lesser extent by the FDIC, as its deposit insurer. The Bank is also subject to federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), though, because it has less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, the FRB and NYSDFS are responsible for examining and supervising the Bank’s compliance with these laws. The regulatory structure establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a state member bank may engage and is primarily intended for the protection of depositors, customers and the DIF. The regulatory structure gives the regulatory agencies extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes.
 The Company is a bank holding company, due to its control of the Bank, and is therefore subject to the requirements of the BHCA, and regulation and supervision by the FRB. The Company files reports with and is subject to periodic examination by the FRB.
 Any change in the applicable laws and regulations, whether by the NYSDFS, FRB, the FDIC, or the CFPB through legislation, could have a material adverse impact on the Company and the Bank and their operations and the Company’s stockholders.
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) made extensive changes in the regulation of insured depository institutions. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act (i) created a new CFPB as an independent bureau to assume responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations, a function previously assigned to prudential regulators; (although institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to the primary enforcement authority of their primary federal bank regulator rather than the CFPB); (ii) directed changes in the way that institutions are assessed for deposit insurance; (iii) mandated the revision of regulatory capital requirements; (iv) codified the FRB’s long-standing policy that a bank holding company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks; (v) required regulations requiring originators of certain securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for the transferred loans; (vi) stipulated regulatory rate-setting for certain third-party debit card interchange fees; (vii) repealed restrictions on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits; (viii) enacted the so-called Volcker Rule, which generally prohibits banking organizations from engaging in proprietary trading and from investing in, sponsoring or having certain relationships with hedge funds and (ix) contained a number of reforms related to mortgage originations.
 While most of the changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act that impact the Company have been implemented or are expected to follow a known trajectory, new changes under the Trump administration, including their nature, timing and impact, cannot yet be determined with any degree of certainty.
 On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”) was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Economic Growth Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository 

 
  14

 
institutions with assets of less than $10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. Many of these changes could result in meaningful regulatory changes for banks and their holding companies.
 The Economic Growth Act, among other matters, simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by instructing the federal banking agencies to establish a single "Community Bank Leverage Ratio" of between 8% and 10%. Any qualifying depository institution or its holding company that exceeds the Community Bank Leverage Ratio will be considered to have met generally applicable leverage and risk-based regulatory capital requirements and any qualifying depository institution that exceeds the new ratio will be considered to be "well-capitalized" under the prompt corrective action rules. In addition, the Economic Growth Act includes regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, the Volcker Rule, mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans. 
 It is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards under the Economic Growth Act will be applied to, or what specific impact the Economic Growth Act and future regulations related thereto will have on the Company or the Bank.
 What follows is a summary of some of the laws and regulations applicable to the Bank and the Company. The summary is not intended to be exhaustive and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations.
 Regulations of the Bank
 Loans and Investments
 State commercial banks have authority to originate and purchase any type of loan, including commercial, commercial real estate, residential mortgages or consumer loans. Aggregate loans by a state commercial bank to any single borrower or group of related borrowers are generally limited to 15% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus, plus an additional 10% if secured by specified readily marketable collateral.
 Federal and state law and regulations limit the Bank’s investment authority. Generally, a state member bank is prohibited from investing in corporate equity securities for its own account other than the equity securities of companies through which the bank conducts its business. Under federal and state regulations, a New York state member bank may invest in investment securities for its own account up to specified limits depending upon the type of security. “Investment securities” are generally defined as marketable obligations that are investment grade and not predominantly speculative in nature. The NYSDFS classifies investment securities into five different types and, depending on its type, a state commercial bank may have the authority to deal in and underwrite the security. The NYSDFS has also permitted New York state member banks to purchase certain non-investment securities that can be reclassified and underwritten as loans.
 Lending Standards and Guidance
 The federal banking agencies adopted uniform regulations prescribing standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate. Under these regulations, all insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, must adopt and maintain written policies establishing appropriate limits and standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or are made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate. These policies must establish loan portfolio diversification standards, prudent underwriting standards (including loan-to-value limits) that are clear and measurable, loan administration procedures, and documentation, approval and reporting requirements. The real estate lending policies must reflect consideration of the federal bank regulators’ Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies that have been adopted.
 The FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and the FRB have also jointly issued the “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices” (the “CRE Guidance”). The CRE Guidance, which addresses land development, construction, and certain multi-family loans, as well as commercial 

 
  15

 
real estate loans, does not establish specific lending limits but rather reinforces and enhances these agencies’ existing regulations and guidelines for such lending and portfolio management. Specifically, the CRE Guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in CRE lending if (1) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% or more of total risk-based capital; or (2) total reported loans secured by multi-family properties, non-farm non-residential properties (excluding those that are owner-occupied), and loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 300% or more of total risk-based capital and the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address key elements, including board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending.
 Federal Deposit Insurance
 Deposit accounts at the Bank are insured up to applicable legal limits by the FDIC’s DIF. Effective July 22, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act permanently raised the deposit insurance available on all deposit accounts to $250,000.
 Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured depository institutions were assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s rate depended upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations. Institutions deemed less risky pay lower FDIC assessments. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured depository institution’s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC adopted changes that eliminated the risk categories and base assessments for most banks on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure over three years. In conjunction with the DIF reserve ratio achieving 1.5%, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was also reduced for small institutions to a range of 1.5 to 30 basis points of total assets less tangible equity.
 The FDIC may adjust its assessment scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment. No insured depository institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment.
 The FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The Bank does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank’s deposit insurance.
 In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, through the FDIC as collection agent, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the now defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The remaining bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2019.
 Capitalization
 The FRB regulations require state member banks, such as the Bank, to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.
 The capital standards require the maintenance of a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio and total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively, and a leverage ratio of at least 4% Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital consists primarily of common stockholders’ equity and related surplus, plus 

 
  16

 
retained earnings, less any amounts of goodwill, other intangible assets, and other items required to be deducted. Tier 1 capital consists primarily of common equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital primarily includes capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). The Bank exercised the opt-out election regarding the treatment of AOCI. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, a bank’s assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests), are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on perceived risks inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one-to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans or are on non-accrual status and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The Bank’s capital conservation buffer was at 2.5% of risk-weighted assets at December 31, 2018.
 As a result of the recently enacted Economic Growth Act, which was enacted on May 24, 2018, the federal banking agencies are required to develop a “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” (the ratio of a bank’s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. A “qualifying community bank” that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered “well-capitalized” under Prompt Corrective Action statutes. The federal banking agencies may consider a financial institution’s risk profile when evaluating whether it qualifies as a community bank for purposes of the capital ratio requirement. The federal banking agencies must set the minimum capital for the new Community Bank Leverage Ratio at not less than 8% and not more than 10%. A financial institution can elect to be subject to this new definition.  
 At December 31, 2018, the Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements.
 Safety and Soundness Standards
 Each federal banking agency, including the FRB, has adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to, among other things, internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits and information security standards. In general, the guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired, and require appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal stockholder. The FDIC also has issued guidance on risks banks may face from third-party relationships (e.g. relationships under which the third-party provides services to the bank). The guidance generally requires the Bank to 

 
  17

 
perform adequate due diligence on the third-party, appropriately document the relationship, and perform adequate oversight and auditing, in order to the limit the risks to the Bank.
 Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action
 Federal law requires that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the statute establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
 State member banks that have insufficient capital are subject to certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory measures. For example, a bank that is “undercapitalized” (i.e. fails to comply with any regulatory capital requirement) is subject to growth, capital distribution (including dividend) and other limitations, and is required to submit a capital restoration plan; a holding company that controls such a bank is required to guarantee that the bank complies with the restoration plan. If an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” A “significantly undercapitalized” bank is subject to additional restrictions. State member banks deemed by the FRB to be “critically undercapitalized” also may not make any payment of principal or interest on certain subordinated debt, extend credit for a highly leveraged transaction, or enter into any material transactions outside the ordinary course of business after 60 days of obtaining such status, and are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after obtaining such status.
 The final rule that increased regulatory capital standards also adjusted the prompt corrective action tiers as of January 1, 2015 to conform to the new capital standards. The various categories now incorporate the newly adopted common equity Tier 1 capital requirement, an increase in the Tier 1 to risk-based assets requirement and other changes. Under the revised prompt corrective action requirements, insured depository institutions are required to meet the following in order to qualify as “well capitalized:” (1) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% (new standard); (2) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% (increased from 6%); (3) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% (unchanged) and (4) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged). 
 Dividends
 Under federal and state law and applicable regulations, a state member bank may generally declare a dividend, without approval from the NYSDFS or FRB, in an amount equal to its year-to-date net income plus the prior two years’ net income that is still available for dividend. Dividends exceeding those amounts require application to and approval by the NYSDFS or FRB. To pay a cash dividend, a state member bank must also maintain an adequate capital conservation buffer under the new capital rules discussed above. Incentive Compensation Guidance
 The FRB, OCC, FDIC and other federal banking agencies have issued comprehensive guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations, including state member banks and bank holding companies, do not undermine the safety and soundness of those organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The incentive compensation guidance sets expectations for banking organizations concerning their incentive compensation arrangements and related risk-management, control and governance processes. In addition, under the incentive compensation guidance, a banking organization’s federal supervisor, which for the Bank and the Company is the FRB, may initiate enforcement action if the organization’s incentive compensation arrangements pose a risk to the safety and soundness of the organization. Further, provisions of the Basel III regime described above limit discretionary bonus payments to bank and bank holding company executives if the institution’s regulatory capital ratios fail to exceed certain thresholds. The scope and content of the banking regulators’ policies on incentive compensation are likely to continue evolving.

 Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders
 Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act govern transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates, which includes the Company. The FRB has adopted Regulation W, which implements and interprets Sections 23A and 23B, in part by codifying prior FRB interpretations.
 An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. A subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution or a “financial subsidiary” under federal law is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for the purposes of Sections 23A and 23B; however, the FRB has the discretion to treat subsidiaries of a bank as affiliates on a case-by-case basis. Section 23A limits the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus. There is an aggregate limit of 20% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus for such transactions with all affiliates. The term “covered transaction” includes, among other things, the making of a loan to an affiliate, a purchase of assets from an affiliate, the issuance of a guarantee on behalf of an affiliate and the acceptance of securities of an affiliate as collateral for a loan. All such transactions are required to be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and no transaction may involve the acquisition of any “low quality asset” from an affiliate unless certain conditions are satisfied. Certain covered transactions, such as loans to or guarantees on behalf of an affiliate, must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100 to 130 percent of the loan amount, depending upon the type of collateral. In addition, Section 23B requires that any covered transaction (and specified other transactions) between a bank and an affiliate must be on terms and conditions that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the bank, as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate.
 A bank’s loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of more than 10% of its stock (each, an “insider”) and certain entities affiliated with any such person (an insider’s “related interest”) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB’s Regulation O. The aggregate amount of a bank’s loans to any insider and the insider’s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to state member banks. Aggregate loans by a bank to its insiders and insiders’ related interests may not exceed 15% of the bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus in the case of loans that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral, or when the aggregate amount on all of the extensions of credit outstanding to all of these persons would exceed the bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. With certain exceptions, such as education loans and certain residential mortgages, a bank’s loans to its executive officers may not exceed the greater of $25,000 or 2.5% of the bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, but in no event more than $100,000. Regulation O also requires that any loan to an insider or a related interest of an insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank, with any interested director not participating in the voting, if the loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider or the insider’s related interests, would exceed the higher of $25,000 or 5% of the bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Generally, such loans must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are no less stringent than, those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and must not involve more than a normal risk of repayment. An exception is made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank.
 Enforcement
 The NYSDFS and the FRB have extensive enforcement authority over state member banks to correct unsafe or unsound practices and violations of law or regulation. Such authority includes the issuance of cease and desist orders, assessment of civil money penalties and removal of officers and directors. The FRB may also appoint a conservator or receiver for a state member bank under specified circumstances, such as where (i) the bank’s assets are less than its obligations to creditors, (ii) the bank is likely to be unable to pay its obligations or meet depositors’ demands in the normal course of business, or (iii) a substantial dissipation of bank assets or earnings has occurred due to a violation of law of regulation or unsafe or unsound practices. Separately, the Superintendent of the NYSDFS also has the authority to appoint a receiver or liquidator of any state-chartered bank under specified circumstances, including where (i) the bank is conducting its business in an unauthorized or unsafe manner, (ii) the bank has suspended payment of its obligations, or (iii) the bank cannot with safety and expediency continue to do business.

 Federal Reserve System
 Under FRB regulations, the Bank is required to maintain reserves at the FRB against its transaction accounts, including checking and Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (“NOW”) accounts. The regulations currently require that banks maintain average daily reserves of 3% on aggregate transaction accounts over $16.3 million and up to $124.2 million and 10% against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of $124.2 million. The first $16.3 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements. The Bank is in compliance with these requirements. The requirements are adjusted annually by the FRB. The FRB began paying interest on reserves in 2008, currently at 2.4%. Examinations and Assessments
 The Bank is required to file periodic reports with and is subject to periodic examination by the NYSDFS and FRB. Federal and state regulations generally require periodic on-site examinations for all depository institutions. The Bank is required to pay an annual assessment to the NYSDFS and FRB to fund the agencies’ operations. Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws
 Federal Regulation
 Under the CRA, the Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA requires the FRB to assess its record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take that record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the Bank. For example, the regulations specify that a bank’s CRA performance will be considered in its expansion (e.g., branching or merger) proposals and may be the basis for approving, denying or conditioning the approval of an application. As of the date of its most recent FRB evaluation, the Bank was rated “Needs Improvement” with respect to its CRA compliance. The Bank has been taking actions to improve its CRA rating.  New York State Regulation
 The Bank is also subject to provisions of the New York State Banking Law that impose continuing and affirmative obligations upon a banking institution organized in New York State to serve the credit needs of its local community. Such obligations are substantially similar to those imposed by the CRA. The latest New York State CRA rating received by the Bank is “Satisfactory.”
 USA PATRIOT Act and Money Laundering
 The Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), which incorporates several laws, including the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the USA PATRIOT Act and related regulations. The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government powers to address money laundering and terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the BSA, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act implemented measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act.

 
  20

 

 Among other things, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act and the related regulations require:

· | Establishment of anti-money laundering compliance programs that includes policies, procedures, and internal controls; the appointment of an anti-money laundering compliance officer; a training program; and independent testing;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Filing of certain reports to Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and law enforcement that are designated to assist in the detection and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing activities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Establishment of a program specifying procedures for obtaining and maintaining certain records from customers seeking to open new accounts, including verifying the identity of customers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In certain circumstances, compliance with enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money-laundering, terrorist financing and other suspicious activity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Monitoring account activity for suspicious transactions; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | A heightened level of review for certain high risk customers or accounts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The USA PATRIOT Act also includes prohibitions on correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and requires compliance with record keeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks.
 The bank regulatory agencies have increased the regulatory scrutiny of the BSA and anti-money laundering programs maintained by financial institutions. Significant penalties and fines, as well as other supervisory orders may be imposed on a financial institution for non-compliance with these requirements. In addition, for financial institutions engaging in a merger transactions, federal bank regulatory agencies must consider the effectiveness of the financial institution’s efforts to combat money laundering activities.
 The Bank has adopted policies and procedures to comply with these requirements.
 Privacy Laws
 The Bank is subject to a variety of federal and state privacy laws, which govern the collection, safeguarding, sharing and use of customer information, and require that financial institutions have in place policies regarding information privacy and security. For example, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and practices for sharing nonpublic information with third parties, provide advance notice of any changes to the policies and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties. It also requires banks to safeguard personal information of consumer customers. Some state laws also protect the privacy of information of state residents and require adequate security for such data, and certain state laws may, in some circumstances, require the Bank to notify affected individuals of security breaches of computer databases that contain their personal information. These laws may also require the Bank to notify law enforcement, regulators or consumer reporting agencies in the event of a data breach, as well as businesses and governmental agencies that own data. Third-Party Debit Card Products and Merchant Services
 The Bank is also subject to the rules of Visa, Mastercard and other payment networks in which it participates. If the Bank fails to comply with such rules, the networks could impose fines or require it to stop providing merchant services for cards under such network’s brand or routed through such network.

 Consumer Finance Regulations
 The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. In this regard, the CFPB has commenced issuing several new rules to implement various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that were specifically identified as being enforced by the CFPB. See “Risk Factors — New and future rulemaking from the CFPB may have a material effect on the operations and operating costs of the Bank”.
 The FRB and the NYSDFS are responsible for examining and supervising the Bank’s compliance with these consumer financial laws and regulations. In addition, the Bank is subject to certain state laws and regulations designed to protect consumers.

  Holding Company Regulation
 The Company, as a bank holding company controlling the Bank, is subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB under the BHCA. The Company is periodically examined by and required to submit reports to the FRB and must comply with the FRB’s rules and regulations. Among other things, the FRB has authority to restrict activities by a bank holding company that are deemed to pose a serious risk to the subsidiary bank.
 The FRB has historically imposed consolidated capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies structured similar, but not identical, to those of state member banks. The Dodd-Frank Act directed the FRB to issue consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary banks applied to bank holding companies as of January 1, 2015. The Company is subject to the consolidated holding company capital requirements.
 The policy of the FRB is that a bank holding company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks by providing capital and other support in times of distress. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength policy.
 Under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank is required to guarantee, within specified limits, the capital restoration plan that is required of an undercapitalized bank. If an undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the FRB may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying dividends or making any other capital distribution.
 As a bank holding company, the Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of a class of voting securities of any additional bank or bank holding company, to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any additional bank or bank holding company or merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. In evaluating acquisition applications, the FRB evaluates factors such as the financial condition, management resources and future prospects of the parties, the convenience and needs of the communities involved and competitive factors. In addition, bank holding companies may generally only engage in activities that are closely related to banking as determined by the FRB. Bank holding companies that meet certain criteria may opt to become a financial holding company and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities.
 FRB policy is that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company’s net income for the past two years is sufficient to fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention is consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, FRB guidance sets forth the supervisory expectation that bank holding companies will inform and consult with FRB staff in advance of issuing a dividend that exceeds earnings for the quarter and should inform the FRB and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends if (i) net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (ii) prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.
 A bank holding company that is not well capitalized or well managed, or that is subject to any unresolved supervisory issues, is required to give the FRB prior written notice of any repurchase or redemption of its outstanding 

 
  23

 
equity securities if the gross consideration for repurchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such repurchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, will be equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a repurchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice or violate a law or regulation. However, FRB guidance generally provides for bank holding company consultation with FRB staff prior to engaging in a repurchase or redemption of a bank holding company’s stock, even if a formal written notice is not required.
 The above FRB requirements may restrict a bank holding company’s ability to pay dividends to stockholders or engage in repurchases or redemptions of its shares.
 Acquisition of Control of the Company
 Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a bank holding company such as the Company unless the FRB has prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition. In evaluating such notices, the FRB takes into consideration such factors as the financial resources, competence, experience and integrity of the acquirer, the future prospects the bank holding company involved and its subsidiary bank and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the company’s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquirer has the power to direct, or directly or indirectly to exercise a controlling influence over, the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a bank holding company’s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable presumption of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, is the case with the Company, the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 Federal Securities Laws
 Metropolitan Bank Holding Corp. is a reporting company subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Emerging Growth Company Status
 The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), which was enacted in April 2012, has made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an Emerging Growth Company (“EGC”). The Company qualifies as an EGC under the JOBS Act.
 An EGC may choose not to hold stockholder votes to approve annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as “say-on-pay” votes) or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” votes). An EGC also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting, and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation. Finally, an EGC may elect to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company, but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an EGC.
 A company loses EGC status on the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year of the company during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the company pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933; (iii) the date on which such company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which such company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally, at least $700 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates).

 Amendments to the SEC’s Smaller Reporting Company Definition
 On June 28, 2018, the SEC adopted amendments to its regulations that raise the thresholds of which entities would be defined as a “smaller reporting company,” which permits scaled disclosure under Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X. The amendments to the smaller reporting company definition became effective on September 10, 2018. Under the new definition of “smaller reporting company,” a company with less than $250 million of public float will be eligible to provide scaled disclosures. Additionally, companies with less than $100 million in annual revenues and either no public float or a public float that is less than $700 million will also be eligible to provide scaled disclosures. Under the revised “smaller reporting company” definition, the Company would be permitted to provide scaled disclosure under Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X. 
 It is difficult at this time to predict whether the SEC may implement additional amendments to its regulations with respect to disclosure requirements and what effect, if any, those future regulations will have on the Company or the Bank.
 The Company has elected to take advantage of certain exemptions allowed as an EGC and smaller reporting company. In addition, the Company has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards as permitted by the JOBS Act.
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The Company has policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and it reviews and document such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations.
