Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a late-stage clinical company that previously focused on advancing targeted fusion protein therapeutics ("TFPTs") for the treatment of patients with cancer. 
Our most advanced product candidate, Vicineum, also known as VB4-845, is a locally administered targeted fusion protein composed of an anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecule ("EpCAM") antibody fragment tethered to a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A for the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer ("NMIBC"). 
On July 15, 2022, we made the strategic decision to voluntarily pause further development of Vicineum in the United States. The decision was based on a thorough reassessment of Vicineum following discussions with the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), which had implications on the size, timeline, and costs of an additional Phase 3 clinical trial, which the FDA previously confirmed would be required for a potential resubmission of a biologics license application ("BLA") for Vicineum for the treatment of NMIBC. As a result of this decision, we turned our primary focus to consummating a strategic transaction with the goal of maximizing stockholder value.
Following an extensive process of evaluating strategic alternatives, including identifying and reviewing potential candidates for a strategic transaction, on September 20, 2022, we, Seahawk Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”), and CARISMA Therapeutics Inc. (“Carisma”), entered into the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated as of September 20, 2022, as amended by the First Amendment thereto dated as of December 29, 2022 and the Second Amendment thereto dated as of February 13, 2023 (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Carisma, with Carisma continuing as our wholly-owned subsidiary and the surviving corporation of the merger (the “Merger”). Our board of directors unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and resolved to recommend that our stockholders approve the proposals described in the Merger Agreement. If the Merger is completed, the business of Carisma will continue as the business of the combined company.
We continue to believe that Vicineum has benefits for patients and healthcare providers that can be maximized through a company with a larger infrastructure, and as such, we are seeking a partner that can execute further development to realize the full potential of Vicineum. As a result of such decision and our subsequent decision to enter into the proposed Merger with Carisma, we no longer plan to pursue regulatory approval of Vicineum for NMIBC in the European Union (the “E.U.”) and have started to wind down certain of our manufacturing operations and business development partnerships. Additionally, we are seeking a partner for the further development of Vicineum and have initiated a formal process and engaged a financial advisor for the potential sale of Vicineum. If the proposed Merger is consummated, the combined company does not expect to pursue further development of Vicineum.
Current Strategy
Anticipated Merger with CARISMA Therapeutics Inc.
The Merger is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2023. In connection with the Merger, we are seeking the approval of our stockholders to, among other things, (a) issue the shares of our common stock issuable in connection with the Merger pursuant to the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”), and (b) amend our amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the outstanding shares of our common stock at a ratio of 1-for-20 (clauses (a) and (b), collectively, the “Sesen Bio Voting Proposals”). The special meeting of stockholders in which our stockholders will be asked to vote on the Sesen Bio Voting Proposals (the “Special Meeting”) will be held on March 2, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. 
Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including, among other things, (a) approval by our stockholders of the Sesen Bio Voting Proposals as described in the Merger Agreement, (b) approval by Carisma’s stockholders of, among other things, the adoption of the Merger Agreement, (c) Nasdaq’s approval of the listing of the shares of our common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger, (d) the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 to register the shares of our common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger, and (e) our having net cash as of closing of the Merger greater than or equal to $70.0 million.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights of each of us and Carisma. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Carisma a termination fee of $7.6 million and/or reimburse Carisma’s expenses up to a maximum of $1.75 million, and Carisma may be required to pay us a termination fee of $5.49 million and/or reimburse our expenses up to a maximum of $1.75 million. 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the completion of the Merger, (a) each then outstanding share of Carisma common stock and Carisma preferred stock (including shares of Carisma’s common stock issued in connection with the pre-closing financing described below) will be converted into the right to receive a number of the shares of our common stock calculated in accordance with the Merger Agreement (the “Exchange Ratio”), and (b) each then outstanding Carisma stock option to purchase Carisma’s common stock will be assumed by us, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Merger Agreement.
Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, Carisma entered into a subscription agreement with certain investors named therein, pursuant to which such investors have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of such subscription agreement, to purchase prior to the consummation of the Merger shares of Carisma’s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $30.6 million (the “Carisma Pre-Closing Financing”). The consummation of the Carisma Pre-Closing Financing is conditioned on the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. Shares of Carisma’s common stock issued pursuant to the Carisma Pre-Closing Financing will be converted into shares of our common stock in the Merger in accordance with the Exchange Ratio.
At or prior to the effective time of the Merger, we will enter into a Contingent Value Rights Agreement (the “CVR Agreement”) with a rights agent (the “Rights Agent”) pursuant to which we intend to declare a dividend payable to our stockholders of record as of a date agreed to by us and Carisma prior to the effective time of the Merger with respect to the receipt of one contingent value right (each, a “CVR”), for each outstanding share of our common stock held by such stockholders on such date. Each CVR will represent the contractual right to receive (i) contingent cash payments upon the receipt by us of certain proceeds payable by Roche, if any, pursuant to the asset purchase agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (collectively, “Roche”) (the “Roche Asset Purchase Agreement”), upon the achievement by Roche of a specified milestone set forth in the Roche Asset Purchase Agreement as well as (ii) proceeds from any sale of our legacy assets, including Vicineum, subject to certain customary deductions, including for expenses and taxes, in the event any sale occurs prior to March 31, 2027. The contingent payments under the CVR Agreement, if they become due, will be payable to the Rights Agent for subsequent distribution to the holders of the CVRs. In the event that no such proceeds are received, holders of the CVRs will not receive any payment pursuant to the CVR Agreement. There can be no assurance that any cash payment will be made or that any holders of CVRs will receive any amounts with respect thereto.
Also in connection with the Merger, we intend to declare a one-time $75.0 million cash dividend payable to our stockholders of record as of a date prior to the effective time of the Merger, subject to the terms and condition set forth in the Merger Agreement. 
On February 13, 2023, a group of our significant stockholders (the “Investor Group”) entered into a voting and support agreement with us and Carisma (the “Support Agreement”) pursuant to which the Investor Group agreed to vote, at the Special Meeting, any and all of their shares of our common stock in favor of the Merger and related matters, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Support Agreement.
Our future operations are highly dependent on the success of the Merger and there can be no assurances that the Merger will be successfully consummated. In the event that we do not complete the Merger with Carisma, we may decide to pursue a dissolution under Delaware law. In a dissolution, there can be no assurances as to the amount or timing of available cash, if any, to distribute to our stockholders after paying our debts and other obligations and setting aside funds for reserves.
Other Recent Events
2022 Restructuring Plan
On July 15, 2022, we approved a restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses and better align our workforce with the needs of our business following the decision to voluntarily pause further development of Vicineum in the United States (the “2022 Restructuring Plan”). Execution of the 2022 Restructuring Plan is expected to be substantially completed in connection with the closing of the Merger, which is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2023. The 2022 Restructuring Plan includes an incremental reduction in our workforce as well as additional cost-saving initiatives intended to preserve capital during the pendency of the Merger and while we seek a potential partner for the further development of Vicineum. We also incurred one-time cash costs associated with the termination of certain contracts and all other activities under the 2022 Restructuring Plan.
2022 Retention Program
On August 28, 2022, our board of directors and the compensation committee of the board of directors approved a retention program for certain employees pursuant to which we will provide a cash incentive designed to retain such employees (the “2022 Retention Program”). Pursuant to the 2022 Retention Program, certain of our employees, including certain executive officers other than our Chief Executive Officer, were to have received a cash bonus award, vesting in full upon the earlier of (a) the completion of a strategic transaction and (b) the termination of such employee without cause, subject to the employee’s continued employment through that time. On February 7, 2023, the compensation committee of the board of directors approved a modification to the 2022 Retention Program, such that the vesting of the retention bonus awards for employees, other than 
executive officers, will occur upon the earlier of (a) 5:00 pm Eastern Time on the second business day following the date of the Special Meeting regardless of the results of the Special Meeting and (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms. The terms of the 2022 Retention Program for those executive officers participating in the 2022 Retention Program were not modified.
Nasdaq Delisting Notice 
On January 25, 2023, we were notified by the Listing Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) of Nasdaq that, based upon our non-compliance with the $1.00 bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Bid Price Rule”), our common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq unless we timely request a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”).
We requested a hearing before the Panel, which stayed any delisting action by the Staff and ensured our common stock remains listed and eligible for trading on Nasdaq pending a determination by the Panel. The hearing had been scheduled for March 16, 2023. On February 24, 2023, we received a determination from the Nasdaq Office of General Counsel that the Panel granted us an exception from our non-compliance with the Bid Price Rule to complete the Merger by March 10, 2023. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5110(a), we must demonstrate compliance with all initial listing requirements of Nasdaq upon the closing of the Merger. We are seeking approval for the Merger and the implementation of a reverse stock split of our common stock at the Special Meeting. In the event we fail to establish compliance with the initial listing standards by March 10, 2023, our common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq, unless granted an additional exception by the Panel.
As previously disclosed, on January 24, 2022, we received written notice from the Staff indicating that, based upon the closing bid price for our common stock for the previous 30 consecutive business days, we no longer satisfied the Bid Price Rule and, in accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, were afforded an initial grace period of 180 calendar days, through July 25, 2022, and a second 180-calendar day period, through January 23, 2023, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. We did not regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule by January 23, 2023, which resulted in the Staff’s January 25, 2023, determination.
Sale of EBI-031 Legacy Technology to Roche
In June 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Roche (the “Roche License Agreement”), pursuant to which we granted Roche an exclusive, worldwide license, including the right to sublicense, to our patent rights and know-how related to our monoclonal antibody EBI-031 and all other IL-6 anti-IL antagonist monoclonal antibody technology owned by us (collectively, the “Roche Licensed Intellectual Property”). Under the Roche License Agreement, Roche was required to continue developing, at its cost, EBI-031 and any other product made from the Roche Licensed Intellectual Property that contains an IL-6 antagonist anti-IL monoclonal antibody and pursue ongoing patent prosecution, at its cost. At the time of entering into the Roche License Agreement, EBI-031, which was derived using our previous AMP-Rx platform, was in pre-clinical development as an intravitreal injection for diabetic macular edema and uveitis.
On July 15, 2022, we entered into the Roche Asset Purchase Agreement pursuant to which Roche purchased all patent rights and know-how related to the monoclonal antibody EBI-031 and all other IL-6 antagonist monoclonal antibody technology owned by us for up to $70.0 million. As a result of the Roche Asset Purchase Agreement, the Roche License Agreement was terminated resulting in no further diligence, milestone or royalty payment obligations under the Roche License Agreement. Pursuant to the Roche Asset Purchase Agreement, Roche made a $40.0 million payment to us upon execution of the Roche Asset Purchase Agreement. The Roche Asset Purchase Agreement also provides that Roche will make an additional $30.0 million payment to us upon Roche’s initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial with EBI-031 for a defined indication if initiated prior to December 31, 2026.
Additionally, in connection with the Merger, each CVR will represent the contractual right to receive contingent cash payments upon the receipt by us of certain proceeds payable by Roche, if any, pursuant to the Roche Asset Purchase Agreement, upon the achievement by Roche of a specified milestone set forth in the Roche Asset Purchase Agreement as well as proceeds from any sale of our legacy assets, including Vicineum.
Our Historical TFPT Platform 
Our historical product candidates are based on our proprietary TFPT platform and are focused on addressing areas of unmet medical need in cancer. Our novel TFPTs have been designed to overcome the efficacy and safety challenges of existing antibody drug conjugates and were being developed for both local and systemic administration. Our TFPTs are single protein therapeutics composed of targeting domains genetically fused via peptide linkers to cytotoxic protein payloads that are produced through our proprietary recombinant one-step, microbial manufacturing process. Our TFPT platform uses antibody fragments, which include Fabs, single chain variable domains ("scFvs"), and non-covalent scFv dimers, derived from the domains of antibodies that confer antigen recognition. We selected antibody fragments for our historical product candidates depending upon the target therapeutic indication. We targeted tumor cell surface antigens showing limited expression on normal cells and once bound, is rapidly internalized into the targeted cancer cell. For local administrations, we utilized an immunogenic cytotoxic protein payload designed to both target cancer cells and promote a heightened local immune response against the 
tumor. Our most advanced locally administered TFPT product candidate was Vicineum, in development for the treatment of non-muscle invasive carcinoma in situ (“CIS”) of the bladder in patients previously treated with adequate or less than adequate bacillus Calmette-Guérin (“BCG”). For systemic administrations, we used deBouganin, a plant-derived, protein payload of reduced immunogenic potential that we believe can be repeatedly administered via infusion without the generation of an efficacy-limiting immune response against the payload.
Vicineum for the treatment of NMIBC
We completed the follow-up stage of our single-arm, multi-center, open-label Phase 3 clinical trial of Vicineum as a monotherapy in patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC (the “VISTA Trial”) in May 2022.
The VISTA Trial completed enrollment in April 2018 with a total of 133 patients. In December 2020, we submitted our completed BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC to the FDA, which was accepted for filing by the FDA in February 2021. The FDA granted Priority Review for the BLA and set a target Prescription Drug User Fee Act date for a decision on the BLA of August 18, 2021. On August 13, 2021, we received a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) from the FDA indicating that the FDA had determined that it could not approve the BLA for Vicineum in its present form and provided recommendations specific to additional clinical/statistical data and analyses in addition to chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (“CMC”) issues pertaining to a pre-approval inspection and product quality. On August 20, 2021, we withdrew our marketing authorization application (“MAA”) to the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) for Vysyneum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC in order to pause our plans to pursue regulatory approval of Vysyneum in the E.U. until there was more clarity from the FDA on next steps for Vicineum in the United States. Vysyneum is the proprietary brand name conditionally approved by the EMA for oportuzumab monatox in the E.U. In October 2021, the EMA issued its Withdrawal Assessment Report relating to its MAA for Vysyneum, as is consistent with the EMA’s standard practice when an MAA is withdrawn. The EMA Withdrawal Assessment Report reflected the initial assessment and corresponding questions from the EMA and identified major objections in the areas of quality, good clinical practice, efficacy, and safety. As a result of our decision on July 15, 2022 to pause further development of Vicineum in the United States, we no longer plan to pursue regulatory approval of Vysyneum for NMIBC in the E.U.
In October 2021 and December 2021, we participated in a CMC Type A meeting and a Clinical Type A meeting, respectively, with the FDA to discuss issues raised in the CRL and design elements of an additional Phase 3 clinical trial for Vicineum, which the FDA confirmed would be required for a potential resubmission of a BLA. In March 2022, we participated in a Type C meeting with the FDA. During the Type C meeting, the FDA agreed to a majority of our proposed protocol and statistical analysis plan design elements for an additional Phase 3 clinical trial. On July 11, 2022, we participated in a Type B meeting with the FDA to discuss outstanding items related to our proposed protocol and statistical analysis plan design elements for an additional Phase 3 clinical trial. As discussed above, on July 15, 2022, we made the strategic decision to voluntarily pause further development of Vicineum in the United States. If the Merger is consummated, the combined company does not expect to pursue further development of Vicineum.
Phase 3 Clinical Trial – VISTA Trial
In the third quarter of 2015, in the United States and Canada, through our subsidiary Viventia Bio, Inc., we commenced the VISTA Trial in patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC who had received adequate BCG and whose disease was-then BCG-unresponsive, and for whom the then-current standard of care was radical cystectomy. In November 2016, the FDA issued draft guidance regarding appropriate clinical trial design for new drugs and biologics for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, including the use of single-arm trials. The FDA finalized this guidance in February 2018 and retained many of the recommendations from the 2016 draft guidance regarding clinical trial design, including the use of single-arm trials. We believe that our VISTA Trial design was consistent with these aspects of the FDA’s guidance. In May 2022, we completed the follow up phase of the VISTA Trial.
The primary and secondary endpoints for the VISTA Trial were as follows:

Dose | 30 mg of Vicineum (in 50 mL of saline) 
Total enrollment | 133 patients, including 93 CIS patients whose disease is BCG-unresponsive 
Primary endpoints | Complete response rate ("CRR") at 3 months in patients with CIS (with or without papillary disease) whose disease is BCG-unresponsive
Kaplan-Meier estimate of duration of response ("DoR") for BCG-unresponsive CIS patients who experience a complete response ("CR") at 3 months (post-induction)

Patients with CIS were considered to have a CR if at the time of any disease status evaluation (per protocol every 13 weeks or any unscheduled evaluation) there was no evidence of high-grade disease (CIS, high-grade Ta or any grade T1 disease) or disease progression (e.g., to muscle invasive disease). Low-grade disease was not considered a treatment failure in these patients, and they could remain on study treatment following TURBT.

Secondary endpoints | Event-free survival in all patients 
CRR at 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months in patients with CIS whose disease is BCG-unresponsive
Time to cystectomy in all patients 
Time to disease recurrence in papillary patients 
Progression free survival (PFS) in all patients 
Overall survival (OS) in all patients 
Safety and tolerability of Vicineum therapy in all patients 
Exploratory endpoint | To evaluate biomarkers that may be associated with response or disease progression or treatment failure, which may include, for example, EpCAM status, tumor subtype morphology, furin levels in tumor cell endosomes, presence of a glycosaminoglycan coat and presence of receptors that could impede a host anti-tumor immune response, such as PD-L1.

The VISTA Trial completed enrollment in April 2018 with a total of 133 patients across three cohorts based on histology and time to disease recurrence after adequate BCG treatment (under 2018 FDA guidance on treatment of NMIBC, adequate BCG is defined as at least one of the following (i) at least five of six doses of an initial induction course plus at least two of three doses of maintenance therapy or (ii) at least five of six doses of an initial induction course plus at least two of six doses of a second induction course):
•Cohort 1 (n=86): Patients with CIS with or without papillary disease that were determined to be refractory or recurred within six months of their last course of adequate BCG;
•Cohort 2 (n=7): Patients with CIS with or without papillary disease that recurred after six months, but less than 11 months, after their last course of adequate BCG; and 
•Cohort 3 (n=40): Patients with high-risk (Ta or T1) papillary disease without CIS that recurred within six months of their last course of adequate BCG.
As of the May 29, 2019 data cutoff date, preliminary primary and secondary endpoint data for each of the trial cohorts were as follows: 
Cohort 1 (n=86) Evaluable Population (n=82) Complete Response Rate, for CIS:

Time Point | Evaluable Patients* | Complete Response Rate(95% Confidence Interval)
3-months | n=82 | 39% (28%-50%) 
6-months | n=82 | 26% (17%-36%) 
9-months | n=82 | 20% (12%-30%) 
12-months | n=82 | 17% (10%-27%) 

*Response-evaluable population includes any mITT patient who completed the induction phase.
Cohort 2 (n=7) Evaluable Population (n=7) Complete Response Rate, for CIS:

Time Point | Evaluable Patients* | Complete Response Rate(95% Confidence Interval)
3-months | n=7 | 57% (18%-90%) 
6-months | n=7 | 57% (18%-90%) 
9-months | n=7 | 43% (10%-82%) 
12-months | n=7 | 14% (0%-58%) 

*Response-evaluable population includes any mITT patient who completed the induction phase.
Pooled Cohorts 1 and 2 (n=93) Evaluable Population (n=89) Complete Response Rate, for CIS:

Time Point | Evaluable Patients* | Complete Response Rate(95% Confidence Interval)
3-months | n=89 | 40% (30%-51%) 
6-months | n=89 | 28% (19%-39%) 
9-months | n=89 | 21% (13%-31%) 
12-months | n=89 | 17% (10%-26%) 

*Response-evaluable population includes any mITT patient who completed the induction phase.
Phase 3 Pooled Complete Response Rate vs. Phase 2 Pooled Complete Response Rate:

Time Point | Phase 3 Pooled CRR (95% Confidence Interval) | Phase 2 Pooled CRR (95% Confidence Interval)
3-months | 40% (30%-51%) | 40% (26%-56%) 
6-months | 28% (19%-39%) | 27% (15%-42%) 
9-months | 21% (13%-31%) | 18% (8%-32%) 
12-months | 17% (10%-26%) | 16% (7%-30%) 

Cohort 3 (n=40) Evaluable Population (n=38) Recurrence-Free Rate†:

Time Point | Evaluable Patients* | Recurrence-Free Rate(95% Confidence Interval)
3-months | n=38 | 71% (54%-85%) 
6-months | n=38 | 58% (41%-74%) 
9-months | n=38 | 45% (29%-62%) 
12-months | n=38 | 42% (26%-59%) 

†Recurrence-free rate is defined as the percentage of patients that are recurrence-free at the given assessment time point.
*Response-evaluable population includes any mITT patient who completed the induction phase.
Duration of Response: The median DoR for patients in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 combined (n=93) was 287 days (95% CI, 154-NE), using the Kaplan-Meier method. Additional ad hoc analysis of pooled data for all patients with CIS (Cohorts 1 and 2, n=93) showed that among patients who achieved a complete response at 3 months, 52% remained disease-free for a total of 12 months or longer after starting treatment, using the Kaplan-Meier method. DoR is defined as the time from first occurrence of complete response to documentation of treatment failure or death.
    We have conducted additional analyses for secondary endpoints. These additional data include the following:
•Time to Cystectomy: Across all 133 patients treated with Vicineum in the VISTA Trial, greater than 75% of all patients are estimated to remain cystectomy-free at 3 years, using the Kaplan-Meier method. Additional ad hoc analysis showed that approximately 88% of responders are estimated to remain cystectomy-free at 3 years. Time to cystectomy is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to surgical bladder removal. The first 2018 FDA guidance on treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC patients states that the goal of therapy in such patients is to avoid cystectomy. Therefore, time to cystectomy is a key secondary endpoint in the VISTA Trial. 
•Time to Disease Recurrence: High-grade papillary (Ta or T1) NMIBC is associated with high rates of progression and recurrence. The median time to disease recurrence for patients in Cohort 3 (n=40) was 402 days (95% CI, 170-NE), using the Kaplan-Meier method. Time to disease recurrence is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study treatment to the first occurrence of treatment failure or death on or prior to treatment discontinuation. 
•Progression-Free Survival ("PFS"): 90% of all 133 patients treated with Vicineum in the VISTA Trial are estimated to remain progression-free for 2 years or greater, using the Kaplan-Meier method. PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression (e.g., T2 or more advanced disease) or death on or prior to treatment discontinuation.
•Event-Free Survival: 29% of all 133 patients treated with Vicineum in the VISTA Trial are estimated to remain event-free at 12 months, using the Kaplan-Meier method. Event-free survival is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the first occurrence of disease recurrence, progression or death on or prior to treatment discontinuation.
•Overall Survival ("OS"): 96% of all 133 patients treated with Vicineum in the VISTA Trial are estimated to have an overall survival of 2 years or greater, using the Kaplan-Meier method. OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to death from any cause.
Data is as of the May 29, 2019 data cut from the Phase III VISTA Trial. The clinical data shown are based on the data submitted in the BLA on December 18, 2020. Final numbers are pending. On August 13, 2021, the FDA issued a CRL for the BLA that included requests for additional clinical and statistical data. 
Safety Results
As of the May 29, 2019 data cutoff date, in patients across all cohorts (n=133) of our Phase 3 VISTA Trial of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, 88% experienced at least one adverse event, with 95% of adverse events being Grade 1 or 2. The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were dysuria (14%), hematuria (13%) and urinary tract infection (12%), all of which are consistent with the profile of bladder cancer patients and the use of catheterization for treatment delivery. These adverse events were determined by the clinical investigators to be manageable and reversible, and only four patients (3%) discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. Serious adverse events, regardless of treatment attribution, were reported in 14% of patients. There were four treatment-related serious adverse events reported in three patients including acute kidney injury (Grade 3), pyrexia (Grade 2), cholestatic hepatitis (Grade 4) and renal failure (Grade 5 or death). There were no age-related increases in adverse events observed in the VISTA Trial.
Outside of United States ("OUS") Business Development Partnering
In connection with our decision to voluntarily pause further development of Vicineum, we commenced the process to wind down our OUS business development partnerships in the Middle East and North Africa region (“MENA”) and Turkey by providing notice of termination for our exclusive license agreements in these respective regions on July 20, 2022. In connection with the termination of the exclusive license agreement with our partner in MENA, we refunded the $3.0 million upfront payment previously paid to us.
Greater China
On July 30, 2020, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Viventia Bio, Inc., entered into an exclusive license agreement with Qilu Pharmaceutical, Co., Ltd. ("Qilu") (the “Qilu License Agreement”) pursuant to which we granted Qilu an exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license, under certain intellectual property owned or exclusively licensed by us, to develop, manufacture, and commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and other types of cancer in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (collectively, “Greater China”). We also granted Qilu a non-exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing sublicense, under certain other intellectual property licensed by us to develop, manufacture and commercialize Vicineum in Greater China. We retained (i) development and commercialization rights in the rest of the world excluding Greater China, MENA, and Turkey and (ii) manufacturing rights with respect to Vicineum in the rest of the world excluding Greater China.
On December 23, 2022, we terminated the Qilu License Agreement. In connection with the termination of the Qilu License Agreement, we agreed to make an aggregate payment to Qilu of $1.4 million, which consists of a $1.2 million termination fee payable upon the termination of the Qilu License Agreement, which was paid in the fourth quarter of 2022, and a $200,000 payment payable upon our receipt of certain clinical data and chemistry, manufacturing, and controls data from Qilu, which such payment was not made as of December 31, 2022. As a result of the termination of the Qilu License Agreement, all rights to Vicineum in Greater China have reverted to us. We currently retain all global rights to Vicineum.
MENA
On November 30, 2020, we and our wholly owned subsidiary, Viventia Bio, Inc., entered into an exclusive license agreement with Hikma Pharmaceuticals LLC (“Hikma”) (the “Hikma License Agreement”), to develop and commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC in the MENA region (20 countries in the Middle East and North Africa). In consideration for the rights granted by us, Hikma agreed to pay to us an upfront payment, sales related milestones payments, and royalties on net sales in the MENA region for the term of the Hikma License Agreement. 
On July 20, 2022, we provided notice of termination of the Hikma License Agreement as a result of the Company’s strategic decision to voluntarily pause further development of Vicineum in the United States. In connection with such termination and as required under the Hikma License Agreement, we refunded to Hikma the $3.0 million upfront payment previously paid to us.
Turkey
On August 5, 2021, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with EİP Eczacıbaşı İlaç Pazarlama A.Ş., (“EIP”) pursuant to which we granted EIP an exclusive license to register and commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC in Turkey and Northern Cyprus (the “EIP License Agreement”). On July 20, 2022, we provided notice of termination of the EIP License Agreement as a result of our strategic decision to voluntarily pause further development of Vicineum in the United States. The EIP License Agreement was terminated on October 20, 2022.
Our Intellectual Property 
We currently own or exclusively license approximately 13 families of patents and applications, which generally relate to our TFPT-based historical product candidates and our platform of targeting agents, cytotoxins (such as deBouganin) and linker technologies.
We exclusively license two families under a license agreement with the University of Zurich ("Zurich") (the "Zurich License Agreement") which, among other things, include composition of matter claims directed to EpCAM antibody chimeras, EpCAM antibody chimera-cytotoxin conjugates, and their potential use in treating bladder and head and neck cancer. These families claim all or portions of Vicineum, as well as methods of treating bladder and head and neck cancer consist of issued patents in the United States, Europe, Canada, China, Israel, and Japan and also include pending applications in the United States. The expiry dates of the patents in this family are April 2024 and June 2025, subject to any applicable patent term adjustment or extension that may be available on a jurisdictional basis. See "Our Vicineum License Agreements" below for additional information.
In addition to the Zurich portfolio, we own two issued United States patents related to Vicineum. The expiry date of these patents is February 2029, subject to any applicable patent term extension that may be available on a jurisdictional basis. 
In addition, we have patent families relating to treatment regimens using Vicineum that include issued patents in the United States, Australia and Japan and patent applications in Canada, Europe, and Hong Kong. These patents will expire in 2036. 
Additionally, we have a license agreement with Micromet AG ("Micromet"), now part of Amgen, Inc., which grants us non-exclusive rights, with certain sublicense rights, for know-how and patents allowing exploitation of certain single chain antibody products (the "Micromet License Agreement"). These patents cover some key aspects of Vicineum. See "Our Vicineum License Agreements" below for additional information.
We also have a license agreement with XOMA Ireland Limited ("XOMA") which grants us non-exclusive rights, with certain sublicense rights, to certain XOMA patent rights and know-how related to certain expression technology, including plasmids, expression strains, plasmid maps and production systems (the "XOMA License Agreement"). These patents and related know-how cover some key aspects of Vicineum. See "Our Vicineum License Agreements" below for additional information.
Our Vicineum License Agreements
In-License Agreement with Zurich
Overview and Exclusivity
We have a license agreement with the University of Zurich ("Zurich") which grants us exclusive license rights, with the right to sublicense, to make, have made, use and sell under certain patents primarily directed to our targeting agent, including an EpCAM chimera and related immunoconjugates and methods of use and manufacture of the same (the “Zurich License Agreement”). These patents cover some key aspects of Vicineum. Upon receipt of the CRL regarding the BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, we became obligated to pay a $0.5 million milestone payment to Zurich pursuant to the Zurich License Agreement. We are also obligated to pay up to a 4% royalty on the net product sales for products covered by or manufactured using a method covered by a valid claim in the Zurich patent rights. Royalties owed to Zurich will be reduced if the total royalty rate owed by us to Zurich and any other third party is 10% or greater, provided that the royalty rate to Zurich may not be less than 2% of net sales. The obligation to pay royalties in a particular country expires upon the expiration or termination of the last of the Zurich patent rights that covers the manufacture, use or sale of a product. There is no obligation to pay royalties in a country if there is no valid claim that covers the product or a method of manufacturing the product. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an expense of $0.3 million for the achievement of the development milestone related to the submission of the BLA for Vicineum with the FDA. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded an expense of $0.5 million for the regulatory milestone related to receipt of the CRL from the FDA in August 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, no related expense was recorded.
Patent Rights
We are responsible for the patent filing, prosecution and maintenance activities pertaining to the patent rights, at our sole expense, while Zurich is afforded reasonable opportunities to review and comment on such activities. If appropriate, we shall apply for an extension of the term of any licensed patent where available, for example, in at least the United States, Europe and 
Japan. In the event of any substantial infringement of the patent rights, we may request Zurich to take action to enforce the licensed patents against third parties. If the infringing activity is not abated within 90 days and Zurich has elected not to take legal action, we may bring suit in our own name (and in Zurich’s name, if necessary). Such action will be at our own expense and Zurich will have the opportunity to join at its own expense. Recoveries from any action shall generally belong to the party bringing the suit, but (a) in the event that we bring the action and an acceptable settlement or monetary damages are awarded, then Zurich will be reimbursed for any amount that would have been due to Zurich if the products sold by the infringer actually had been sold by us, or (b) in the event a joint legal action is brought, then the parties shall share the expense and recoveries shall be shared in proportion to the share of expense paid by the respective party. Each party is required to cooperate with the other in litigation proceedings at the expense of the party bringing the action.
Term and Termination
The term of the Zurich License Agreement expires as of the expiration date of the last patent to expire within the Zurich patent rights. We are currently projecting an expiration date for the United States licensed patents in June 2025, subject to any applicable patent term extension that may be available on a jurisdictional basis. Zurich has the right to terminate the Zurich License Agreement if we breach any obligation of the agreement and fail to cure such breach within the applicable cure periods. We have the right to terminate the Zurich License Agreement at any time and for any reason by giving 90 days written notice to Zurich.
In-License Agreement with Micromet
Overview
The Micromet License Agreement grants us nonexclusive rights, with certain sublicense rights, for know-how and patents allowing exploitation of certain single chain antibody products. These patents (which are now expired) cover some key aspects of Vicineum. Under the terms of the Micromet License Agreement, as of December 31, 2021, even though the patents have expired, we may be obligated to pay up to €2.4 million in milestone payments for the first product candidate that achieves applicable regulatory and sales-based development milestones (approximately $2.6 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2022). We are also required to pay up to a 3.5% royalty on the net sales for products covered by the Micromet License Agreement, which includes Vicineum. The royalty rate owed to Micromet in a particular country will be reduced to 1.5% if there are no valid claims covering the product in that country. The obligation to pay royalties in a particular country expires upon the later of the expiration date of the last valid claim covering the product and the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product in such country. Finally, we are required to pay to Micromet an annual license maintenance fee of €50,000, which can be credited towards any royalty payment we owe to Micromet. We recorded an expense of €0.7 million ($0.9 million) related to achievement of a development milestone in the three months ended December 31, 2020, due to the submission of the BLA for Vicineum with the FDA in December 2020. We recorded an expense of €0.5 million ($0.6 million) related to the submission of the MAA to the EMA for Vysyneum™ in the first quarter of 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded an expense of €50,000 ($51,770) related to the annual license maintenance fee.
Patent Rights
Micromet, at its sole expense, is responsible for the patent filing, prosecution and maintenance activities pertaining to the patent rights. In any patent enforcement action initiated by Micromet, we may be required, upon the request of Micromet and at Micromet’s expense, to provide reasonable assistance to Micromet with respect to such enforcement action.
Term and Termination
The term of the Micromet License Agreement expires as of the expiration of any royalty obligations under covered by the Micromet License Agreement. Either party has the right to terminate the Micromet License Agreement if the other party fails to comply with any of its material obligations under the Micromet License Agreement and fails to cure such non-compliance within the applicable cure periods.
In-License Agreement with XOMA
Overview
The XOMA License Agreement grants us non-exclusive rights, with certain sublicense rights, to certain XOMA patent rights (which are now expired) and know-how related to certain expression technology, including plasmids, expression strains, plasmid maps and production systems. These patents and related know-how cover some key aspects of Vicineum. Under the terms of the XOMA License Agreement, even though the patents have expired, we are required to pay up to $0.25 million in milestone payments for a product candidate that incorporates know-how under the license and achieves applicable clinical development milestones. We are also required to pay a 2.5% royalty on the net sales for products incorporating XOMA’s technology, which includes Vicineum. We have the right to reduce the amount of royalties owed to XOMA on a country-by-country basis by the amount of royalties paid to other third parties, provided that the royalty rate to XOMA may not be less than 1.75% of net sales. In addition, the foregoing royalty rates are reduced by 50% with respect to products that are not covered by 
a valid patent claim in the country of sale. The obligation to pay royalties in a particular country expires upon the later of the expiration date of the last valid claim covering the product and the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product in such country.
Patent Rights
XOMA, at its sole expense, is responsible for the patent filing, prosecution and maintenance activities pertaining to the patent rights. In any patent enforcement action initiated by XOMA, we may be required, upon the request of XOMA and at XOMA’s expense, to provide reasonable assistance to XOMA with respect to such enforcement action.
Term and Termination
The term of the XOMA License Agreement expires as of the expiration of any royalty obligations under the XOMA License Agreement. Either party has the right to terminate the XOMA License Agreement if the other party fails to comply with any of its material obligations under the XOMA License Agreement and fails to cure such non-compliance within the applicable cure periods.
Our Manufacturing
During the third quarter of 2022, we entered into a Lease Termination Agreement (the “Lease Termination Agreement”) pursuant to which we terminated the operating lease agreement for our 31,100 square foot facility in Winnipeg, Manitoba which consisted of manufacturing, laboratory, warehouse, and office space and agreed to end the lease by September 30, 2022. As part of the execution of the Lease Termination Agreement, we paid the landlord the all-inclusive sum of CAD $1.2 million (USD $0.9 million).
Fujifilm and Baxter 
In October 2018, we entered into a Master Bioprocessing Services Agreement with FUJIFILM DIOSYNTH Biotechnologies U.S.A., Inc.("Fujifilm") (the “Fujifilm MSA”) for the manufacturing process and technology transfer of Vicineum drug substance production.
In November 2019, we entered into a Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Baxter Oncology GmbH ("Baxter") (the “Baxter CMSA”) for the manufacturing process and technology transfer of Vicineum drug product production. 
In August 2020, we completed manufacturing of the drug substance process performance qualification (“PPQ”) batches at Fujifilm and in September 2020, we successfully completed the drug product PPQ batches at Baxter. All of the completed drug substance PPQ batches and drug product PPQ batches met all quality acceptance criteria. 
In December 2020, we received and analyzed all of the analytical comparability test results from the drug substance and drug product PPQ batches. For analytical comparability, we conducted testing across four categories: release testing, biophysical characterization, forced degradation studies, and stability studies. This approach was in alignment with requirements of the FDA, the EMA and the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. The test results for Vicineum produced by Fujifilm and Baxter were found to be highly comparable to our supply of Vicineum produced at our Winnipeg facility. 
On October 29, 2021, at the CMC Type A Meeting, the FDA confirmed that Vicineum manufactured using the proposed commercial process is comparable to Vicineum used in prior clinical trials and confirmed that we can utilize Vicineum manufactured during process validation for any future clinical trials needed to address issues raised in the CRL regarding the BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, and that any of these future trials can proceed while addressing CMC issues raised in the CRL.
In January 2022, we signed a Scope of Work with Fujifilm under the Fujifilm MSA for the manufacturing of commercial batches of Vicineum in 2022 and 2023.
In July 2022, in connection with our decision to voluntarily pause further development of Vicineum, we terminated the Fujifilm MSA and Baxter CMSA and requested that Fujifilm and Baxter cease all work under the respective agreements and refrain from incurring any additional costs or expenses. As a result of the termination, and in accordance with the terms of the Fujifilm MSA and Baxter CMSA, we paid Fujifilm and Baxter for certain non-manufacturing stage services and current Good Manufacturing Practice batches of drug substance of Vicineum.
Qilu
In June 2021, we entered into a Global Supply Agreement with Qilu pursuant to which Qilu will be part of the manufacturing network for, if approved, global commercial supply of Vicineum drug substance and drug product (the “Qilu Global Supply Agreement”). On December 23, 2022, we terminated the Qilu Global Supply Agreement in connection with the termination of the Qilu License Agreement. 
Corporate History and Acquisition of Viventia
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 2008. We were formerly known as “Denovo Therapeutics, Inc.” and “Newco LS14, Inc.” before changing our name to “Eleven Biotherapeutics, Inc.” in February 2010 and again to “Sesen Bio, Inc.” in May 2018. 
In September 2016, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Viventia Bio, Inc., a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada, the shareholders of Viventia named therein (collectively, the "Selling Shareholders") and, solely in its capacity as seller representative, Clairmark Investments Ltd., a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada (“Clairmark”), pursuant to which we agreed to and simultaneously completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Viventia from the Selling Shareholders (the "Viventia Acquisition"). In connection with the closing of the Viventia Acquisition, we issued 4.0 million shares of our common stock to the Selling Shareholders according to their pro rata share of Viventia’s then-outstanding shares of common stock, which represented approximately 19.9% of our voting power as of immediately prior to the issuance of such shares of common stock. Clairmark is an affiliate of Leslie L. Dan, who served on our board of directors until his retirement in July 2019.
In connection with the Viventia Acquisition, we are obligated to pay to the Selling Shareholders certain post-closing contingent cash payments upon the achievement of specified milestones and based upon net sales, in each case subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the acquisition agreement, including: (i) a one-time milestone payment of $12.5 million payable upon the first sale of Vicineum (the "Purchased Product") in the United States; (ii) a one-time milestone payment of $7.0 million payable upon the first sale of the Purchased Product in any one of certain specified European countries; (iii) a one-time milestone payment of $3.0 million payable upon the first sale of the Purchased Product in Japan; and (iv) and quarterly earn-out payments equal to 2% of net sales of the Purchased Product during specified earn-out periods. Such earn-out payments are payable with respect to net sales in a country beginning on the date of the first sale in such country and ending on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2033, and (ii) fifteen years after the date of such sale, subject to early termination in certain circumstances if a biosimilar product is on the market in the applicable country. 
Under the Share Purchase Agreement, we, our affiliates, licensees and subcontractors are required to use commercially reasonable efforts, for the first seven years following the closing of the Viventia Acquisition, to achieve marketing authorizations throughout the world and, during the applicable earn-out period, to commercialize the Purchased Product in the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, Japan, China and Canada.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had seventeen full-time employees and no part-time employees. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and none are represented by labor unions. We have not experienced any work stoppages. We believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory.
