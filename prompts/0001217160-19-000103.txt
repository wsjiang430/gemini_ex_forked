General Development of Business

Incorporation and Subsidiaries

Jewett-Cameron Trading Company Ltd. was incorporated under the Company Act of British Columbia on July 8, 1987 as a holding company for Jewett-Cameron Lumber Corporation (JCLC), which was incorporated in September 1953. Jewett-Cameron Trading Company, Ltd. acquired all the shares of JCLC through a stock-for-stock exchange on July 13, 1987, and at that time JCLC became a wholly owned subsidiary. Effective September 1, 2013, the Company completed a reorganization of certain of its subsidiaries and JCLCs name was changed to JC USA Inc. (JC USA). JC USA has the following wholly owned subsidiaries. MSI-PRO Co. (MSI), incorporated in April 1996, Jewett-Cameron Seed Company, (JCSC), incorporated in October 2000, Greenwood Products, Inc. (Greenwood), incorporated in February 2002, and Jewett-Cameron Company (JCC) incorporated in September 2013. Jewett-Cameron Trading Company, Ltd. and its subsidiaries have no significant assets in Canada.
Corporate Development

Incorporated in 1953, JC USA operated as a small lumber wholesaler based in Portland, Oregon. In September 1984, the original stockholders sold their interest in the corporation to a new group of investors. Two members of that group remained active in the Company. These individuals are Donald Boone, who passed away in May, 2019, and who was the previous Chairman and Director and the former President, Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer, and Principal Financial Officer, transitioning to strictly the Board Chair in 2017; and Michael Nasser, who remains active in the business and is both a Director and the Corporate Secretary.

In July 1987, the Company acquired JC USA in what was not an arms-length transaction.

In early 1986, prior to JC USA being acquired by the Company, JC USA acquired Material Supply International (Material Supply). Material Supply was engaged in the importation and distribution of pneumatic air tools and industrial clamps. The product line was re-branded as MSI-PRO and MSI was incorporated in 1996 to carry-on the business of Material Supply.

In October 2000, JCSC was incorporated in anticipation of JC USA acquiring the business and certain assets of a firm called Agrobiotech Inc. JCSC operates as a seed storage, processing and sales business.

In February 2002, Greenwood was incorporated in anticipation of JC USA acquiring the business and certain assets of Greenwood Forest Products Inc. Greenwood is involved in the processing and distribution of specialty wood products.

In June 2012, the Company acquired land and fixed assets located in Manning, Oregon for $250,000 cash. The property was sold in an arms-length transaction in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 for $325,000 cash.

In May 2019 Chairman and Co-Founder of the Company Donald M. Boone passed away. Mr. Boone served as President and CEO from 1984 until 2017 when he voluntarily retired from his officer positions and oversaw the addition and successful integration of new management and directors.

In September 2019 the Board of Directors decided to permanently close the Companys MSI-Pro division. Recent efforts to drive further sales and margin growth were unsuccessful due to a lack of market differentiation and changing customer patterns. The remaining inventory will be liquidated, and the personnel will be moved into different positions with the Company. 

Narrative Description of Business

The Companys operations are classified into four segments. Sales, income before taxes, assets, depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures, and interest expense by segment are shown in the footnotes to the financial statements.
Lawn, Garden, Pet and Other  JCC 

The lawn, garden, pet and other segment reflects the business of Jewett-Cameron Company (JCC), which is a manufacturer and distributor of specialty metal products and a wholesaler of wood products formerly conducted by JCLC. 

JCC operates out of a 5.6 acre owned facility located in North Plains, Oregon that includes an office, a warehouse, and a paved yard. This business is a wholesaler of wood products and a manufacturer and distributor of specialty metal products. Wood products are primarily fencing, while metal products include an array of pet enclosures, kennels, and pet welfare and comfort products, proprietary gate support systems, perimeter fencing, greenhouses, canopies and umbrellas. Examples of the Companys brands include Lucky Dog, Animal House and AKC (used under license from the American Kennel Club) for pet enclosures and kennels; Adjust-A-Gate, Fit-Right, Perimeter Patrol, and Lifetime Post for gates and fencing; Early Start, Spring Gardner, and Weatherguard for greenhouses; and TrueShade for patio umbrellas, furniture covers and canopies. JCC uses contract manufacturers to make the specialty metal products. Some of the products that JCC distributes flow through the Companys facility in North Plains, Oregon, and some are shipped direct to the customer from the manufacturer. Primary customers are home centers, eCommerce partners, and other retailers. 

The home improvement business is seasonal, with higher levels of sales occurring between February and August. Inventory buildup occurs until the start of the season in February and then gradually declines to seasonal low levels at the end of the summer. 

JCC has concentrated on building a customer base for lawn, garden, and pet related products. Management believes this market is less sensitive to downturns in the U.S. economy than is the market for new home construction as its products serve both new and existing home and pet owners.

The wood products that JCC distributes are not unique and are available from multiple suppliers. However, the metal products that JCC manufactures and distributes may be somewhat differentiated from similar products available from other suppliers. The company has been successful garnering key patents and trademarks on multiple products that assist their ability to continue to differentiate based on design and functionality.

JCC owns the patents and manufacturing rights connected with the Adjust-A-Gate and Fit-Right products, which are the gate support systems for wood, vinyl, chain link, and composite fences. Management believes the ownership of these patents results in an important competitive advantage for these and certain other products. During fiscal 2018, the Company applied for zero new patents (fiscal 2018  2), while 1 other patent was granted (fiscal 2018  3). One of the patents granted in 2018 was an update of the Adjust-a-Gate, which will extend the protection on the Adjust-a-Gate products for an additional 15 years. In addition to the patents, JCC also has two licensing agreements to market pet products.

Backlog orders are a factor in this business as customers may place firm priced orders for both wood and metal products for shipments to take place three to four months in the future.

Industrial Wood Products - Greenwood

Greenwood is a wholesale distributor of a variety of specialty wood products. Operations are co-located in the building utilized by JCC and MSI.

Historically, a major product category has been treated plywood that is sold to the transportation industry. In February 2014, the Company sold its remaining and excess inventory related to the marine industry. Greenwoods total sales for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 9% and 8% respectively of total Company sales.

The primary market in which Greenwood competes has decreased in economic sensitivity as users are incorporating products into the municipal and mass transit transportations sectors.

Inventory is maintained at non-owned warehouse and wood treating facilities throughout the United States and is primarily shipped to customers on a just-in-time basis. Inventory is generally not purchased on a speculative basis in anticipation of price changes.

Greenwood has no significant backlog of orders. 

Seed Processing and Sales - JCSC 

JCSC operates out of an approximately 12 acre owned facility located adjacent to North Plains, Oregon. JCSC processes and distributes agricultural seed. Most of this segments sales come from selling seed to distributors with a lesser amount of sales derived from cleaning seed. Sales of seed has some seasonality, but it most affected by weather patterns in multiple parts of the United States that also affect cyclical planting. The annual weather plays an important part in year-to-year sales volatility. However, profitability around the month of August may be unusually high based on a seasonal surge in cleaning sales, which are much more profitable than product sales. 

JCSC has no backlog of sales orders.

Industrial Tools and Clamps - MSI

This business operates from the same owned facilities as JCC. MSI imports and distributes products including pneumatic air tools, industrial clamps, and saw blades. These products are primarily sold to wholesalers that in turn sell to contractors and end users. Sales of these products tend to be relatively uniform throughout the year. 

MSIs product line was expanded in 2007 to include saw blades, digital calipers, and laser guides. MSI brands include MSI-Pro, Avenger, and ProMax.

In September 2019, the Board of Directors decided to permanently close the MSI division.

Tariffs

The Companys metal products are manufactured in China and are imported into the United States. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) instituted new tariffs on the importation of a number of products into the United States from China effective September 24, 2018. These new tariffs are a response to what the USTR considers to be certain unfair trade practices by China. The tariffs began at 10%, and subsequently were increased to 25% as of May 10, 2019. A number of the Companys products manufactured in China have been subject to duties of 25% when imported into the United States. 

The company was notified in September 2019 that products that it had imported would be excepted from tariff treatment moving forward. This exception applies to most of the products the company imports.

Also, the Companys single largest customer was responsible for 33% and 38% of total Company sales for the years ended August 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018 respectively. 
Employees

As of August 31, 2019 the Company had 58 full-time employees (August 31, 2018  57 full-time employees). By segment these employees were located as follows: Greenwood 1, JCC 30, JCSC 8, MSI 2, and JC USA 17. None of these employees are represented by unions at the Company. Jewett-Cameron Trading Company Ltd. has no direct employees, and the CEO of the Company is employed by JC USA.
