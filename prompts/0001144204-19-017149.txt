ITEM 1. Business
Overview
 
CSSE is a growing media company building online video-on-demand (“VOD”) networks that provide positive and entertaining video content for all screens. We own Popcornflix®, a popular online advertiser-supported VOD (“AVOD”) network, Pivotshare, a subscription-based VOD (“SVOD”) network, Truli.com, a faith-based AVOD network, and four additional AVOD networks. These VOD networks collectively have rights to exhibit tens of thousands of hours of movies and television episodes to our millions of monthly unique visitors. Another subsidiary, Screen Media, is a leading global independent television and film distribution company, which owns one of the largest independently owned television and film libraries. We also curate, produce and distribute long- and short-form video content that brings out the best of the human spirit, and distribute the online content of our U.S. based subsidiary, A Plus. We are aggressively growing our business through a combination of organic growth, licensing and distribution arrangements, acquisitions and strategic relationships. We are also expanding our partnerships with sponsors, television networks and independent producers.
 
All of our online networks are available for all screens, including mobile devices. We expect the increasingly widespread penetration of 5G mobile networks, with virtually no latency and 10 times the download capacity of 4G, to be an accelerator of mobile video consumption.
 
We have an exclusive, perpetual and worldwide license agreement (“CSS License Agreement”) with our intermediate parent, CSS, a publishing and consumer products company, to create and distribute video content under the Chicken Soup for the Soul® brand (the “Brand”).


We operate in three areas:
 

· | Online Networks. In this business area, we distribute and exhibit VOD content directly to consumers across all digital platforms, such as smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles and the web through our owned and operated AVOD networks including Popcornflix® and Truli. We also distribute our own and third-party owned content to end users across various digital platforms through our owned and operated SVOD network Pivotshare. Popcornflix® delivers tens of millions of advertisements every month and Pivotshare has approximately 25,000 active subscriptions. Our VOD content library includes over 37,000 hours of programming. Our AVOD networks have over 3 million monthly unique visitors. We generate advertising revenues primarily by serving video advertisements to our streaming viewers. In March 2019, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with Crackle, Inc. (“Crackle”) which is currently a business of Sony Pictures Television (“SPT”) to build a VOD business. Crackle has agreed to contribute certain assets comprising its Crackle AVOD network, to the joint venture and we agreed to contribute our VOD networks and assets. Subject to satisfaction of closing conditions, we expect to close the acquisition and launch the joint venture on or around May 2019. The joint venture will be branded “Crackle Plus”.

· | Television and Film Distribution. In this business area, we distribute movies and television series worldwide to consumers through license agreements across all media, including theatrical, home video, pay-per-view, free, cable, pay television, VOD, mobile and new digital media platforms worldwide. We own the copyright or long-term distribution rights to approximately 1,500 television series and feature films.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Television and Short-Form Video Production. In this business area, we work with sponsors and use highly regarded independent producers to develop and produce our television and short-form video content, including Brand-related content. We also derive revenue from our subsidiary A Plus, which develops and distributes high-quality, empathetic short-form videos to millions of people worldwide. A Plus enhances our ability to distribute short form versions of our video productions and video library and provide us with content developed and distributed by A Plus that is complementary to the Brand.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Since our inception in January 2015, our business has grown rapidly. For the full year 2018, our net revenue was $26.9 million, as compared to 2017 net revenue for the full year of $10.7 million. This increase was primarily due to the revenue impact of Screen Media, the acquisition of Pivotshare in August of 2018, and increased production revenue. We had net losses of $2.0 million in 2018, as compared to net income of $21.1 million in 2017. Our 2018 Adjusted EBITDA (excluding the accounting impact of our acquisition of A Plus) was $11.3 million, as compared to 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $4.0 million (excluding a gain on bargain purchase of $24.3 million related to the 2017 Screen Media acquisition).
 
Business Strategy
 
Our vision is to use our solid core of traditional media production and distribution assets to build a powerful portfolio of online VOD networks and assets. Our production and distribution businesses generate current revenue and Adjusted EBITDA to fund our rapidly growing online networks. We will build and acquire assets such as content libraries, digital publishers with content related to our own, and stand-alone VOD networks. Adjusted EBITDA is defined in the section titled “—Reconciliation of Historical GAAP Net Income as Reported to Adjusted EBITDA”.
 
One of our fundamental objectives is to continue to grow our VOD networks to create a “network of networks” as we continue to increase our content offerings to critical mass. Our strategy is to build our library of video content through a combination of Chicken Soup for the Soul original video content and opportunistic acquisitions of third-party video content libraries, such as our transformative acquisition of Screen Media, or other rights to video content as distressed networks seek to monetize their content libraries. Strategically, the proliferation of video content networks continues to create opportunities for us to aggregate existing networks under a single portal, acquire content and networks from distressed owners.

Online Networks
 
Our acquisition of Screen Media accelerated our entry into the direct-to-consumer VOD market through Popcornflix® which has an extensive footprint with apps that have been downloaded more than 27 million times.
 
Popcornflix® is one of the largest AVOD services. Under the Popcornflix® brand, we operate a series of direct-to consumer advertising supported channels. On Popcornflix®, we have the rights to exhibit more than 3,000 films and approximately 60 television series comprised of approximately 1,500 episodes, with new content added regularly. As a “free-to-consumer” digital streaming channel, Popcornflix® is an extremely popular online video platform that can be found on the web, iPhones and iPads, Android products, Roku, Xbox, Amazon Fire, Apple TV, Chromecast and Samsung and Panasonic Internet-connected televisions, among others. Popcornflix® is currently available in 56 countries and territories, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, the Scandinavian countries, Germany, France, Hong Kong and Singapore, with additional countries and territories to be added.
 
While Popcornflix® is currently an advertiser-supported VOD network, we have also begun to also expand in SVOD networks.
 
Our entry into subscription-based VOD was initiated by our acquisition of the Pivotshare VOD network in August 2018. Pivotshare is comprised of a series of subscription-based VOD channels with 28,000 hours of programming. Pivotshare generates approximately $2.5 million in gross billings and has approximately 25,000 paid subscriptions with average monthly billings of $9 per subscription.
 
In October 2018, we completed the acquisition of the assets of Truli Media Corp., a nascent global family-friendly and faith-based online video channel (“Truli”). The Truli content library includes 2,500 hours of programming and brings us an additional 630,000 Facebook fans. Truli’s content fits strategically in our plans and includes film, television, music videos, sports, comedy, and educational material. With the completion of the acquisition, Truli became our seventh advertiser-supported VOD channel.
 
On March 27, 2019, we entered into an agreement (“Contribution Agreement”) with Crackle, Inc. (“Crackle”), which is currently a business of Sony Pictures Television (“SPT”), one of the television industry’s leading content providers, to contribute our respective VOD businesses to a newly-formed joint venture entity, Crackle Plus, LLC. The combined VOD businesses will be branded “Crackle Plus”. Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, we agreed subject to satisfaction of closing conditions, to contribute assets relating to our VOD business and to assign to Crackle Plus the rights to use the Brand in VOD and Crackle agreed to contribute to Crackle Plus certain assets relating to the Crackle VOD business.
 
We believe that Crackle Plus will be one of the largest providers of free AVOD service in the United States with an expected approximately 10 million monthly unique users on our owned and operated networks with an audience of millions more served through our advertising representation network. We anticipate that Crackle Plus will have 26 million registered users. Crackle Plus will be highly competitive in the growing AVOD space as it is expected to launch with over 100 VOD networks and more than 90 content partnerships, assuming full contribution by the parties upon the terms of, and after closing of the Contribution Agreement. Upon launch, we believe Crackle Plus will stream over 1.3 billion minutes per month. The addition of Crackle Plus to our company is expected to more than double our overall annual revenue and will add meaningful EBITDA. The transaction is expected to close on or around May 2019. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.
 
Television and Film Distribution
 
We distribute television series and films worldwide through Screen Media. We own the copyright or long-term distribution rights to approximately 1,700 hours of television series and feature films, representing one of the largest independently owned libraries of filmed entertainment in the world. We distribute our television series and films through direct relationships across all media, including theatrical, home video, pay-per-view, free, cable and pay television, VOD and emerging digital media platforms worldwide.
 
Screen Media’s distribution capabilities across all media gives us the ability to distribute our produced television series directly and may eliminate the distribution fees (as much as 30% of revenue) that we currently pay to third parties for distribution of the rights we retain when we produce series with our sponsors. We believe that the cost savings from Screen Media’s distribution capabilities may enhance our revenue and profits from our produced television series.
 
We have distribution licensing agreements with numerous digital services across all major platforms, such as cable and satellite VOD and Internet VOD, which includes TVOD for rentals or purchases of films, AVOD for free-to-viewer streaming of films supported by advertisements and SVOD for unlimited access to films for a monthly fee.
 
Our cable and satellite VOD distribution agreements include those with DirecTV, Optimum (Altice USA), Verizon and In Demand (owned by Comcast, Charter and Cox). Our Internet VOD distribution agreements include those with Amazon, iTunes, Samsung, YouTube, Hulu, Xbox, Netflix, Sony and Vudu, among others.
 
We are rapidly expanding international distribution of our content through agreements with Film Mode Entertainment, iTunes, Sony PlayStation and Xbox, among others. Under these agreements, our titles are available on iTunes, Sony PlayStation and Xbox in the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany, Italy and Hong Kong, with additional territories added regularly.
 
Television and Short-Form Video Production
 
We utilize the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand, together with our management’s industry experience and expertise, to generate revenue through the production and distribution of video content with sponsors. We partner with sponsors and use highly-regarded independent producers to develop and produce video content. Using this approach provides us with access to a diverse pool of creative ideas for new video content projects and allows us to scale our business on a variable cost basis. We currently have producer agreements or arrangements in place with a number of these producers, including Litton Entertainment (a Hearst company). We anticipate entering into relationships with additional independent producers.
 
We seek committed funding from corporate and foundation sponsors covering more than the production costs prior to moving forward with a project. Since we seek to secure both the committed funding and production capabilities for our video content prior to moving forward with a project, we have high visibility into the profitability of a particular project before committing to proceed with such project. In addition, we take limited financial risk on developing our projects.
 
Corporate and foundation sponsors with which we work include HomeAway, Hilton Grand Vacations, American Humane, Chegg, Acorns, the Boniuk Foundation, State Farm, Michelson Found Animals Foundation and the Morgridge Family Foundation, and we are currently in discussions with numerous others. We endeavor to retain meaningful back-end rights to our video content in these relationships, which provides opportunities for improved profitability and enhances our library value.
 
In December 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of A Plus, an affiliate of ours. Prior to the acquisition, A Plus was majority owned by an affiliate of CSS and, pursuant to a Distribution Agreement, we had the exclusive worldwide rights to distribute all video content (in any and all formants) and all editorial content (including articles, photos and still images) created, produced, edited or delivered by A Plus, and we received a net distribution fee equal to 30% of gross revenue generated by the distribution of the A Plus video content. As a result of the acquisition, the Distribution Agreement was terminated, resulting in our retention of 100% of the revenues generated by A Plus going forward, along with projected cost savings in 2018, and over $5 million for our company in 2019.

Our long-form video content consists of 30- to 60-minute episodic programs typically distributed initially on traditional television or cable networks. Our current long-form video content projects include:

The fathers are all bound by the singular belief that raising their children is life’s greatest gift. In August 2018, the series began streaming on Netflix.

Its second season is currently airing on A&E Network. The series was nominated for a Real Screen award in the “Digital and Branded Content: Brand-Funded Content” category.

· | Going From Broke. Ashton Kutcher is the executive producer on this new series about the 44 million young Americans that are today saddled with student and credit card debt totaling nearly $1.5 trillion. Recent college graduates have no idea how to dig themselves out of their financial disaster. Going From Broke is hosted by money expert Dan Rosensweig, CEO of multi-billion dollar company Chegg. Throughout the series, Dan helps these millennials deal with their financial challenges.

· | Chicken Soup for the Soul’s Animal Tales (“Animal Tales”). This series is sponsored by Chicken Soup for the Soul Pet Food and American Humane, the country’s first national humane organization. This series celebrates everything pets and animals add to our lives. The series will bring awareness to the Chicken Soup for the Soul mission of helping all pets eat well, whether that’s by making super premium pet food that is affordable or donating millions of meals to shelter pets every year. The show premiered on the CW Network in January 2019 hosted by Eva La Rue.

Our short-form video content, including our branded short-form video content known as Sips, is receiving increased focus from our advertisers and sponsors. Such short-form video content is typically exhibited through online video content distribution through A Plus and various social media platforms, such as YouTube, Facebook, as well as on the social media channels of Chicken Soup for the Soul and our sponsors. A Plus is adding more short-form video content, and we are focusing on acquisitions in this space. Increasing revenue from short-form video will make our business less lumpy and assist in reducing the relative size of fourth quarter revenue compared to other quarters.
 
Competition
 
Video content production and distribution direct to consumers are highly competitive businesses. We face competition from companies within the entertainment business and from alternative forms of leisure entertainment, such as travel, sporting events, outdoor recreation, video games, the internet and other cultural and computer-related activities. We compete with the major studios, numerous independent motion picture and television distribution and production companies, television networks, pay television systems and online media platforms for the services of performing artists, producers and other creative and technical personnel and production financing, all of which are essential to the success of our businesses.
 
In addition, our video content competes for media outlet and audience acceptance with video content produced and distributed by other companies. As a result, the success of any of our video content is dependent not only on the quality and acceptance of a particular production, but also on the quality and acceptance of other competing video content available in the marketplace at or near the same time.
 
Given such competition, and our stage of development, we intend to initially emphasize a lower cost structure, risk mitigation, reliance on financial partnerships and innovative financial strategies. Our cost structures are designed to utilize our flexibility and agility as well as the entrepreneurial spirit of our employees, partners and affiliates, in order to provide creative, desirable video content.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We are party to the CSS License Agreement (as defined) through which we have been granted the perpetual, exclusive, worldwide license by CSS to produce and distribute video content using the brand and related content, such as stories published in the Chicken Soup for the Soul books. Chicken Soup for the Soul and related names are trademarks owned by CSS. We have the proprietary rights (including copyrights) in all our Sips and company-produced content. With the acquisition of Screen Media, the Company now owns copyrights or global long-term distribution rights to Screen Media film library as well as ownership of Screen Media’s AVOD application Popcornflix®.
 
We rely on a combination of confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information and intellectual property rights.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 40 direct employees. We expect to add a material number of Crackle employees upon consummation of our joint venture transaction. The services of certain personnel, including our chairman and chief executive officer, vice chairman and chief strategy officer, our senior brand advisor and director, and chief financial officer, are provided to us under the CSS Management Agreement. We also utilize many consultants in the ordinary course of our business and hire additional personnel on a project-by-project basis. We believe that our employee and labor relations are good, and we are committed to inclusion and strict policies and procedures to maintain a safe work environment.

Corporate Information
 
We are a Delaware corporation formed on May 4, 2016. CSS Productions, our predecessor and immediate parent company, was formed in December 2014 by CSS, and initiated operations in January 2015. We were formed to create a discrete entity focused on video content opportunities using the Brand. In connection with our succession to the operations of CSS Productions, all video content assets owned by CSS and any of its affiliates, including all rights and obligations related thereto, were transferred to us upon formation on May 4, 2016. Thereafter, CSS Productions’ operating activities ceased, and the Company continued the business operations of producing and distributing the video content.
 
In May 2016, pursuant to the terms of the contribution agreement among CSS, CSS Productions and the Company (the “CSS Contribution Agreement”), all video content assets (the “Subject Assets”) owned by CSS, CSS Productions and their CSS subsidiaries were transferred to the Company in consideration for its issuance to CSS Productions of 8,600,568 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock. Since the date of the CSS Contribution Agreement, CSS Productions has transferred certain of these shares of Class B common stock to third parties in certain transactions. Concurrently with the consummation of the CSS Contribution Agreement, certain rights to receive payments under certain agreements comprising part of the Subject Assets owned by Trema, LLC (“Trema”), a company principally owned and controlled by William J. Rouhana, Jr., the Company’s chairman and chief executive officer, were assigned to the Company under a contribution agreement (the “Trema Contribution Agreement”) in consideration for the Company’s issuance to Trema of 159,432 shares or our Class B common stock.
 
Thereafter, CSS Productions’ operating activities ceased, and the Company continued the business operations of producing and distributing the video content.
 
The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company has irrevocably elected to avail itself of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards, and, therefore, will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
 
Internet Address and Availability of Filings
 
We maintain a website at www.cssentertainment.com. The Company makes available, free of charge, on or through its internet website, the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company complied with this policy for every Exchange Act report filed during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company”, as defined in the JOBS Act, and, for so long as we are an emerging growth company, are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These include, but are not limited to:

· | Not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors’ report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We may remain an “emerging growth company” until as late as December 31, 2022, the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, though we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including if (a) we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue in any fiscal year, (b) the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 or (c) we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
