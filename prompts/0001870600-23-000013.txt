Our Mission
We aim to help the customers in our communities live a good life by inspiring moments that create lasting memories. When we are at our best, our products serve as the centerpiece of awesome experiences and unlock nostalgia for past ones. We own and operate premium authentic outdoor brands with ingenious products influenced by customer feedback. We consistently deliver innovative, high-quality products that are loved by our customers and revolutionize the outdoor experience, build community and help everyday people reconnect with what matters most.
Who We Are
Solo Brands operates four premium outdoor brands; Solo Stove, Oru Kayak (“Oru”), ISLE Paddle Boards (“ISLE”), and Chubbies apparel. Our brands develop innovative products and market them directly to customers primarily through e-commerce channels, as well as wholesale partnerships with key retailers. Our platform is led by our largest brand, Solo Stove, which was founded in 2011 by two brothers seeking to bring family together in the outdoors. Our founders combined their passion for e-commerce with their love of the outdoors to create a digitally-native platform to market the revolutionary Solo Stove Lite (“Lite”), an ultralight portable backpacking camp stove that can boil water in under 10 minutes using just twigs, sticks, and leaves. Solo Stove followed the success of the Lite with the launch of its iconic, stainless steel, virtually smokeless fire pits in 2016, pioneering a new product category that has helped foster a loyal community of enthusiasts and furthers our efforts to bring people together.
Since its inception in 2011, Solo Stove’s growth and free cash flow allowed us to make significant investments in our global supply chain and bring fulfillment, research and development, sales and marketing, and customer service in-house. This infrastructure provides an authentic end-to-end customer experience, expedited delivery, greater cost efficiencies, and redundancy in manufacturing. It also laid the groundwork for the creation of Solo Brands, Inc.
Our business provides distinct competitive advantages, including an attractive financial profile and a unique ability to acquire and operate outdoor brands that broaden our product assortment and share our values of authenticity, product quality, and community. Through our DTC and wholesale channels, we develop connections with our customers, receive real-time feedback that informs our product development roadmap and digital marketing decisions, and enhance our brands. This deep connection with our customers helps to drive an attractive return on marketing spend and positions us to capitalize on a significant runway of future expansion. We believe that our model creates a flywheel effect of rapid growth, scalability, and robust free cash flow generation which, in turn, enables us to re-invest in product innovation, strategic acquisitions, marketing and global infrastructure.
Product Design and Development
We approach product design and development with the goal of advancing our mission to build community, revolutionize the outdoor experience, and help everyday people reconnect with what matters most. Solo Brands and its products are driven by the “create good” philosophy, and are designed to get you in touch with whatever “good” is for you. We create good products that foster good moments and memories, so our customers can create a good life.
Our products undergo a rigorous development process designed to maximize performance while minimizing complexity, delivering a superior degree of quality, functionality, portability, style, and ease-of-use. The Solo Stove Lite set the standard, and we have continued to design and develop groundbreaking, high-performance products engineered with purposeful simplicity. We carefully design and engineer every product for immediate enjoyment, free of complexity and intimidating learning curves often found in engineered outdoor and lifestyle products. While employing the same approach that led to the success of our stoves, we have successfully broadened our product line to include virtually smokeless fire pits, cooking systems, pizza ovens, patio heaters, and storage units, and added portable kayaks and paddle boards, lifestyle apparel and other accessories.
At Solo Brands, not only are our products innovative, but we believe our approach to innovation stands apart from the competition. We don’t believe in behind-the-curtain intuition-driven design, but rather customer-driven product development. We employ a data-driven approach to portfolio expansion opportunities and a product development process that is guided by direct customer feedback and is designed to allow for exceptionally fast development time from idea to product delivery. Our approach includes digesting data our customers provide us and incrementally enhancing our offerings to drive customer satisfaction and love of our products and brands. We have continued to expand our product lines by designing solutions grounded in customer insights and requests, including new products and accessories and additional sizes of existing product lines, and through strategic acquisitions that complement the Solo Brands platform.
The Solo Brands product design teams control every aspect of our innovation, including design, construction, material performance requirements, manufacturing protocols, supplier selection, packaging specifications, and quality plans. Once we approve the final design and specifications of a new product, depending on the product, we either source materials directly or partner with specialized third-party manufacturers to produce our products according to our performance and quality standards. Each of our brands has established deep relationships with trusted third-party manufacturers—predominantly in China and Southeast Asia, as well as in Mexico through a dedicated facility operated by a manufacturing labor outsourcing company.
We have recently expanded our product development team and have built a new state-of-the-art research and development center at our headquarters to ensure continued design, testing, and quality control while optimizing speed-to-market. Our space features over 10,000 square feet of fabrication, test space, and machinery to facilitate experimentation and the ideation and development of new offerings. We are also expanding Oru’s manufacturing operations in Mexico by adding additional supply lines and seeking additional suppliers for other recreational products.
Products
We offer wide-ranging and high quality products directly to our customers through our platform. Our products are carefully designed to maximize performance while minimizing complexity. We create highly functional, yet simple products that are both durable and easy-to-use. 
Camping Stoves. We revolutionized the camp stove category with the launch of our Solo Stove Lite in 2011. This ultralight and portable product does not require synthetic fuel and can boil water in under 10 minutes using just twigs, sticks, and leaves found outside. Today, our Stoves include the Lite, Titan, and Campfire, each of which is wood burning and incorporates our secondary burn technology, creating a hotter flame great for cooking. Each Stove also has a variety of cooking pots and accessories.
Fire Pits. We created a new fire pit category in late 2016 with our portable, low smoke product offerings. Solo Stove fire pits provide a mesmerizing, virtually smokeless fire experience in minutes, anywhere our customers want to be—in the mountains under the stars, on the beach, at the campground, tailgating at the game, or at home in the backyard—our products are designed to go where you go. The Solo Stove fire pit product offering includes the new tabletop Mesa, Ranger, Bonfire, Yukon, and Canyon, each of which burns wood fuel to a fine ash for easy cleaning. Made of lightweight, durable stainless steel, our fire pits epitomize the Solo Stove brand promise of uncompromising quality, portability, and function.
Cooking. In 2022 we continued to lean into expanding the cooking category. In addition to the multiple Cook Top surfaces (cast iron griddle, skillet, and wok) used in connection with our fire pits, we launched Solo Stove Pi, a standalone durable stainless steel pizza oven with a collection of accessories. We continue to see opportunity for expansion in the cooking category. We recently introduced Pi Fire, a convenient pizza oven attachment to be used over a Solo Stove fire pit, and a collection of accessories and grilling tools to further enhance our customers’ cooking experiences. 
Outdoor Heating. In 2022, we disrupted the outdoor heating market by launching a wood-pellet burning patio heater. Virtually smokeless, and easy to use with a small bag of wooden pellets rather than an expensive and heavy propane tank, our patio heater provides head to toe warmth. 
Recreation. Oru Kayak is the original origami kayak that allows users to go from box to boat in a matter of minutes. Oru offers premier kayaks that require minimal storage space, are portable, and easy-to-use. The Oru brand includes five kayak models, the Inlet, Beach LT, Bay ST, Coast XT, and Haven. Built with durable, corrugated OruPlast™ technology, our kayaks offer premium quality, exceptional control and stability, and starting at just 20 pounds, they are highly portable and can be transported in the trunk of a small car or carried on public transportation. ISLE produces high-quality stand-up paddle boards and a hybrid kayak with colorful designs that are engineered to accommodate every skill level, style, and interest. ISLE offers ten models across seven product categories—Inflatables, Yoga, Fishing, All Around, Touring, Surf, and Epoxy. With an emphasis on form and function, ISLE’s products are intended to help users reconnect with the simple joy of getting outside, and their innovative portable designs allow users take them anywhere they can find floatable water.
Storage. Launched in 2021, the Station provides an optimized storage solution for fire pits, firewood, and other accessories. The Station provides highly functional storage that enables our customers to keep their outdoor products in one convenient location. Built to withstand ice, rain, and snow with a powder-coated aluminum frame and a UV-coated cover, the Station’s dual shelf design supports a carrying weight of up to 250 pounds. The Station has broadened our consumer reach and was designed in response to real-time consumer feedback.
Lifestyle Apparel. Chubbies is a fun-loving, premium apparel brand that offers well-fitted comfortable clothing with unique style. The Chubbies brand has historically had five main product lines—Swim Trunks, Casual Shorts, Sport, Polos + Shirts, and Lounge. In 2022, Chubbies launched multiple pant styles ranging from business performance pants to joggers and sweats. Created with high performance stretch fabric, Chubbies offers premium quality with a lightweight and breathable design that can be worn anywhere and anytime.
Consumables. Consumables provide a high margin, recurring revenue stream that increases customer lifetime value and supports repeat purchases and engagement with our community. The consumables category includes fun products that enhance the Solo Brands experience, such as Color Packs, and exciting add-ons, including Starters, All Natural Charcoal, firewood, and pellets.
Accessories. Our Accessories are designed to make the Solo Brands experience easier and more memorable. Many accessories are the product of direct customer feedback, satisfying a specific need our community has highlighted. They deepen our relationship with customers, increase order values, and support repeat engagement. The Accessories category spans the Solo Stove, Oru, and ISLE brands and includes products such as the Shelter, Shield, Roasting Sticks, Tools, Paddles, and Pumps.
Marketing
Our multifaceted marketing strategy engages existing and new customers and has proven instrumental in driving sales and building brand awareness and affinity. We utilize data-driven performance marketing tactics to engage with our targeted customer base and create differentiated brand marketing content designed to drive an authentic customer experience and fuel brand awareness and loyalty for each of our brands independently.
We employ a wide range of marketing tactics and outlets to cultivate our relationships with experts, enthusiasts, and everyday consumers. Our in-house marketing team actively utilizes a combination of digital, social media, traditional, and grass-roots initiatives to support our brand. Our in-house marketing team is a major differentiator and strength for the Company as it allows us to execute quickly, pivot when needed, and do both at a cost far below what it would cost to outsource to marketing agencies. With loyal customers already rooted with each of our brands, we also believe a large opportunity exists for effective cross-marketing.
Sales Channels
We are an omni-channel company that leverages the power of both e-commerce as well as physical retail stores. In addition to our strong DTC execution, we are strategically expanding our wholesale channel through retail partners that support our brand image and share our passion and dedication for innovative, best-in-class products of uncompromising design and performance. Our net sales are concentrated in the United States, though we have a growing international presence.
Direct-to-Consumer. We go-to-market with a digital-first strategy which prioritizes a direct connection with customers through e-commerce channels. Our currently owned brands generate the majority of sales online, including through owned social channels such as Facebook and Instagram that route visitors to our sites. This is supplemented by our DTC business via relationships with select third-party e-commerce marketplaces, such as Amazon. We believe these sales channels provide incremental sales reach for our business and opportunities to increase awareness for our brands. In fiscal year 2022, DTC sales accounted for 81.8% of Solo Brands sales. In 2022, we have continued to make meaningful investments in our e-commerce and digital platform to drive growth, including the implementation of cutting-edge technology, marketing, and analytics to increase speed and ease of use on both our desktop and mobile sites.
Through our owned brand websites, we offer our entire product portfolio and create a unique experience for our customers that reflects some of the same design principles that we incorporate into our products—simple, elegant and high performance. Our sites provide a content-rich and educational shopping experience, inviting customers to experience our brands, learn about our products through extensive overviews, specifications and intuitive FAQs, discover ways to enjoy our products, and hear firsthand from our customers’ experiences with our brands. Customers can access blogs through our websites, where we publish premium digital content, share customer stories and information on products, and further cultivate our community. We believe our digital expertise provides us a competitive advantage and is replicable and extendible across other brands.
Our owned brand websites are also where we engage with our corporate customers, which represent a rapidly growing customer segment, particularly as we introduce additional customization options such as logo etchings to our fire pits. We believe our corporate customers and organizations appreciate our authentic brands and product quality and value the opportunity to attach their brands to Solo Brands products, including to provide valued gifts. Our customized products and corporate sales have meaningfully contributed to sales growth while generating attractive margins. The corporate customers represent opportunities for substantial repeat business.
We also operate five Chubbies retail stores and one ISLE surf pro-shop, which provide additional opportunities to interact directly with our customers in person and strengthen customer relationships.
Wholesale. We have built relationships with well-known outdoor products and sporting goods retailers. We choose our retail partners carefully based on their reputation, demographic, and commitment to appropriately learn and showcase Solo Brands’ portfolio of products, provide hands-on customer service, and abide by our terms and conditions, including consistent adherence to our minimum-advertised price (“MAP”) policy. We also sell products on websites of retailers. These sites give Solo Brands even more online presence in our effort to ensure customers find us wherever they choose to shop for outdoor and recreation products. Our strategic retail channel distribution is supported by our dedicated sales and account management team. This team serves our retail partner base and identifies potential new wholesalers to expand our geographic footprint.
Seasonality
We believe that our sales include a seasonal component. Historically, our net sales have been highest in our second and fourth quarters, with the first quarter typically generating the lowest sales. This historical sales trend is supported by the demand for our products at the beginning of the summer and holiday shopping seasons. We expect that this seasonality will continue to be a factor in our results of operations and sales.
Segment Information
We operate as one reportable segment.
Supply Chain and Quality Assurance
We manage a supply chain of third-party manufacturing and logistics partners to produce and distribute our products. We work with partners who allow for production flexibility, efficiency and scalability, possess capabilities to support new products, meet our expanding sales channel strategies and other required operational needs. We currently have a number of manufacturing partners located in various countries, India, Vietnam, and Mexico, with the majority of our manufacturing concentrated with a single manufacturer in China.
Our supply chain management team researches materials and equipment, vets potential manufacturing partners, directs our internal demand and production planning, approves and manages product purchasing plans, and oversees product transportation. While we have selected our current manufacturers for commercial and operational reasons, there are currently alternative suppliers that we believe we can qualify and engage to supply products and materials of the same quality, in similar quantities, and on substantially similar terms as our current providers if needed. From time to time, we source new suppliers and manufacturers to support our ongoing innovation and growth, particularly in our more recently introduced product categories, and we carefully evaluate all new suppliers and manufacturers to ensure they share our standards for quality of manufacturing, ethical working conditions and environmental sustainability practices.
Quality is critically important to us and we work closely with our manufacturing partners with respect to product quality and manufacturing process efficiency. As part of our quality assurance program, we have developed and implemented comprehensive product inspection and facility oversight processes that are performed by our employees and third-party resources. They work closely with our suppliers to assist them in meeting our quality standards, as well as improving their production yields and throughput. While we do not directly source significant amounts of raw materials and components for most of our products, we control the specifications for key raw materials used in our products.
Distribution and Inventory Management
A majority of our products are shipped from our manufacturers to one of our three United States distribution centers in Grapevine, Texas; Manchester, Pennsylvania; and Salt Lake City, Utah. These distribution centers, which we operate, are strategically located across the United States, allowing us to provide faster delivery throughout the United States. Certain of our products are distributed directly from our manufacturing facility in Mexicali, Mexico. The remaining portion of our products are shipped directly to one of our National Retail Partners or one of our distributors.
Additionally, we leased a 20,000 square foot facility in Canada and a 72,000 square foot facility in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Our domestic and international warehouses position Solo Brands to reach customers quickly and position us to realize immediate cost savings. We believe our domestic capacity and the capacity of international providers is sufficient to meet our future needs. We manage inventory by analyzing product sell-through, forecasting demand, and working with our supply chain to ensure sufficient availability. We have also contracted with third-party logistics companies to store and manage shipments to customers in Australia. We use a warehouse management system at these distribution centers that interfaces with our ERP system so that we can maintain visibility and control over inventory levels and customer shipments.
Intellectual Property and Brand Protection
We take the protection of our intellectual property very seriously and have taken a variety of operational and legal measures to protect our distinctive brand, designs, and inventions. Our engineering and industrial design teams collaborate at our Grapevine, Texas headquarters to create new products, and are supported by individual product design teams at the various brand levels. As part of this process, all product designs, specifications, and performance characteristics are developed and designed. After these aspects of the process are complete, we seek intellectual property protection, including applying for patents and for registration of trademarks for new classes where applicable.
We own the patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade dress, and other intellectual property rights that relate to our brands and to key aspects of certain of our products. We have sought to protect these intellectual property rights in the United States as well as in other countries where our products are manufactured and/or sold. We believe these intellectual property rights, combined with our innovation and distinctive product design, performance, and brand name reputation, provide us with a competitive advantage.
We aggressively pursue and defend intellectual property rights to protect our distinctive brand, designs, and inventions. We use third-party enforcement agencies, and have processes and procedures in place to identify, protect, and optimize our IP assets on a global basis. Our experienced legal and brand protection teams initiate claims against those offering infringing products to protect our intellectual property assets, including our distinctive designs, copyrights, and trade dress. In the future, we intend to continue to seek intellectual property protection for our new products and prosecute those who infringe against these valuable assets.
Information Technology
Information technology, or IT, systems are integral to our ability to operate, analyze and manage our business, research and develop new products, enhance our customers’ experience, and optimize our operating costs. Our infrastructure is cloud-first, as we believe it provides the most flexibility, scalability, and is inherently resilient with platform level redundancy in networking and computer hardware. We leverage third-party components and software to enhance our platform capabilities and recently implemented upgraded ERP and e-commerce systems to improve our operations and manage our growing company. We utilize leading software solutions for key aspects of our information systems. We believe our planned systems infrastructure will be sufficient to support our expected growth for the foreseeable future.
Competition
We compete in the large outdoor, leisure, recreation, and lifestyle apparel markets and may compete in other addressable lifestyle markets. Competition in our markets is based on a number of factors including product quality, performance, durability, styling, ease-of-use, and price, as well as brand image and recognition. We believe that we have been able to compete successfully on the basis of our superior design capabilities and product development, brands, customer service, and our DTC capabilities. We operate in a category of one and believe that our value proposition and unique branded digital strategy creates a competitive moat which sets us apart from competition in the broader fragmented outdoor, leisure, recreation, and lifestyle apparel markets.
Human Capital Management
Solo Brands has a seasoned management team with extensive industry experience and a dedicated focus on developing a strong, intentional company culture. We continue to invest in our people, adding key management personnel to our platform with the goal to accelerate our profitable growth, strengthen and complement our existing leadership team, and leverage the sharing of best practices across the platform. Our increasingly well-known portfolio of brands and our culture of innovation, collaboration and personal development enables us to recruit top talent in all areas of our business.
We are focused on recruitment, retention, diversity and training, all areas where we see significant opportunity as we scale and bring on new team members. We believe the dedicated team of Solo Brands employees is a critical factor to our past and future success and intend to continue investing in our team’s well-being. None of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have experienced no labor-related work stoppages and employee relations are considered to be good. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 350 employees.
Environmental, Social, and Governance
Solo Brands believes in creating good and giving back to the communities that have supported our growth. We are committed to making a long-term impact through our initiatives which cover a broad range of ESG-related topics, including: environmental sustainability, water conservation, diversity, equity, inclusion, and mental health.
We partner with leading non-profits to drive meaningful change in supporting the conservation of our natural world. For example, our donations to-date as part of our partnerships are expected to result in the planting of more than ten thousand trees across the globe—with the goal of our donations over the next five years supporting the planting of one million trees. We also strive to serve individuals within our communities more directly, and have launched projects and foundations to do so. In 2020, we launched Project Good, which provides free Solo Brands products to people in need and provides a variety of local service projects, and in 2021, we launched Foundation 43, which expands access to mental health and suicide prevention services through local community organizations. We are also committed to fostering diversity in the workplace, with a five year goal of building a Solo Brands workforce that is fully representative of the diverse U.S. population. At Solo Brands, we believe businesses of the future must be accountable for leaving the world better than we found it.
