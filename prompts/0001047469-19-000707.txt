     Item 1.    Business 
  General 
         USANA Health Sciences, Inc. is one of the largest publicly held direct-selling nutrition, personal health and wellness companies in the world. In 2018, we generated $1.189 billion in net sales from more than 616,000 active Customers worldwide. We were founded in 1992 by Myron W. Wentz, Ph.D. and since that time we have developed and manufactured high-quality, science-based nutritional and personal care products with a primary focus on promoting long-term health and wellness. In so doing, we are committed to continuous product innovation and sound scientific research. We have operations in 24 markets worldwide, where we distribute and sell our products by way of direct selling. Mainland China is our largest market and single largest source of revenue, representing approximately 50% of net sales and active Customers. We have chosen the direct selling distribution method as we believe it is the most conducive to meeting our vision as a company, which is improving the overall health and nutrition of individuals and families around the world. As a U.S.-based multi-national company with an expanding international presence, our operating results are sensitive to currency fluctuations, as well as economic and political conditions in markets throughout the world. Additionally, we are subject to the various laws and regulations in the United States, China, and the other markets in which we operate with respect to the products that we sell and to our method of distribution. 
         Our customer base is primarily comprised of two types of customers: "Associates" and "Preferred Customers" referred to together as "active Customers." Our Associates also sell our products to retail customers. Associates share in our company vision by acting as independent distributors of our products in addition to purchasing our products for their personal use. Preferred Customers purchase our products strictly for personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute the products. We only count as active Customers those Associates and Preferred Customers who have purchased from us at any time during the most recent three-month period. 
         This portion of our Annual Report on Form 10-K provides detailed information about who we are, what we do and where we are headed. Unless otherwise specified, current information reported in this Form 10-K is as of or for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. We also discuss the development of our company and the geographic areas where we do business. 
         Throughout this Form 10-K, unless specified otherwise, references to "USANA," "we," "our," "us" and "the Company" refer to the consolidated company. References to "dollars" and "$" are to United States dollars.

     Current Focus and Growth Strategy 
         We have implemented or are implementing the following strategies and initiatives intended to increase the number of active Customers who use our products throughout the world and, thereby, further our company vision: 


 Customer Experience and Technology Enhancements.  To generate active
Customer growth, we are striving to enhance the overall experience a customer has when doing business with USANA, which we sometimes refer to as "customer experience" or our "customer experience
initiative." To improve our customer experience, we continue to improve the speed, convenience, and ease with which customers do business with USANA. In 2019, this will include improving our mobile
technology platform, offering new payment options to meet the demands of active Customers across the globe, providing quick and simple product education, capturing important feedback, and making it
easier for our active Customers to share their experience with friends and family. 
 Social Media and Sharing:  Historically, the direct selling channel has been
characterized by in-person promotion and selling of products. While we believe that direct selling will continue to rely on person-to-person relationships, we believe that the future of direct selling
entails sharing, marketing and selling products through various social media platforms, which is sometimes referred to as social sharing. Consequently, (i) we continue to increase our emphasis
on training and educating our Associates to market and sell our products through social sharing, and (ii) many of our customer experience initiatives are also intended to enhance our social
sharing platform. For example, over the last few years we have worked to implement a WeChat platform for our active Customers in China. In 2019, we will
continue to improve our WeChat technologies to further promote social sharing and we will introduce a WeChat platform for our Chinese customers in markets
outside of China. 
 Product Innovation and Deployment.  Our research and development team
continually reviews the latest scientific findings related to nutrition, conducts or manages research and clinical trials, reviews new technologies, and attends scientific conferences. If, in that
process, we see potential for a new product or ingredient that provides a measurable and important health benefit, and we believe this benefit can be realized by a significant number of our customers,
we will generally pursue development of that product. For 2019, our science team has developed new products and formulated upgrades to certain existing products within each of our current product
categories that we plan to introduce throughout the year. These include new food products, Celavive ® product line extensions, and upgrades to certain of our nutritional supplements.
During the year, we also plan to launch a new healthy living product line and focus extensively on the customer experience associated with this line. This new line will offer products that are
customer focused, demonstrable, and easily sharable through social sharing. Finally, we have also begun implementing a plan to bring the manufacturing of our food products in-house, which will provide
us with several advantages and efficiencies over third-party manufacturing. 



In
the first quarter of 2018, we launched our Celavive skin and personal care line in every market except China. We then launched this line in China late in the third quarter of 2018. Our 2019
objective is to further promote the Celavive line and to introduce certain product line extensions during the year. 


 Existing Market Growth and International Expansion.  After opening of our
four new European markets in 2018, during 2019 we will focus on generating sales and active Customer growth in our existing markets. This strategy includes enhancing our focus and development of
submarkets, which entails targeting and addressing the needs of different customer demographics within a single market. 

 7

   

Notwithstanding
our current focus, we continue to believe that growth opportunities exist in new international markets and plan to expand our business to new markets in the future. We select new
markets following an assessment of several factors, including market size, anticipated demand for USANA products, receptiveness to direct selling, and the market entry process, which includes
consideration of possible regulatory restrictions on our products or our direct selling model. Wherever possible, we endeavor to integrate our Associate Compensation Plan in each market to allow
Associates to receive compensation for globalnot merely localproduct sales. We believe our seamless Compensation Plan enhances our ability to expand internationally, and we
intend, where permitted, to integrate future markets into this Compensation Plan. 


 Successfully Grow each of our Regions through Market Specific Strategies and
Incentives.  While our objective is to generate sales and active Customer growth in each of our markets around the world, in light of the strength
of our Asia Pacific region and our growing active Customer base in Asia, we continue to believe that our Asia Pacific region represents our most significant and imminent growth opportunity. Over the
last few years, we have generated solid growth in several markets within this region, especially in mainland China. Although, mainland China is our largest market, we continue to believe that it
provides a significant growth opportunity for our business. Accordingly, we will continue to focus on growing in China during 2019. To that end, we plan to execute a variety of market-specific
strategies in 2019 in Asia Pacific, and mainland China specifically, to generate growth, which include offering: (i) certain new product introductions described above; (ii) targeted
product promotions during the year; and (iii) other performance-based incentive offerings during the year. For example, 2018 marked the first time that we have included product sales and
promotions at our China National Meeting. We plan to hold this meeting in Macau again during 2019 and expect to once again offer product for sale to improve on the experience we provided in 2018.
Additionally, we plan to continue to improve our information systems, technology and infrastructure in China during 2019. 



Our
Americas and Europe region is also very important to our business and a significant part of our growth strategy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our sales and active Customer results in this region
have declined over the last few years. Our objective for this region remains centered on increasing the overall number of active Customers who consistently use USANA products. To achieve our
objective, we plan to execute a number of strategies in this region in 2019, which include new product introductions and certain product promotions similar to those that will be offered in our Asia
Pacific
region. Additionally, we plan to begin offering a variety of new initiatives in select markets in this region, particularly in the U.S., on a limited time or trial basis. These initiatives will
include certain product enhancements and new compensation and loyalty offerings for our sales force and customers. 


 Increase Brand Awareness.  We continue to pursue strategies to increase our
brand awareness around the world to accomplish our Company vision. In this regard, in 2018 we renewed and extended our relationship with Dr. Mehmet Oz as a Trusted Partner and Sponsor of The
Dr. Oz Show. While this partnership has focused on our North America region historically, it now focuses on China as well.
Additionally, this partnership is intended to increase brand awareness and recognition of the USANA brand in our other regions. Under this partnership, USANA products are regularly featured on The Dr. Oz
Show and viewers of the show are able to purchase USANA products via a direct link on The Dr. Oz
Show website. We also promote global awareness of the USANA brand through professional athlete sponsorships and credible associations with individuals and organizations.
Examples of this include our sponsorship of the U.S. Ski Team, Speed Skating Canada, and US Speedskating, our partnership with the Women's Tennis Association, and our support of AFC Bournemouth of The Premier
League in England. We continue to serve as the official health supplement supplier for these teams and 

 8

   

organizations
and are also increasing our sponsorship of individual athletes who rely on our products and brand. We seek to leverage these relationships to build brand credibility and increase product
consumption and loyalty. 


 Pursue Strategic Acquisitions.  We believe that attractive acquisition
opportunities may arise in the future. We intend to pursue strategic acquisition opportunities that would grow our customer base, expand our product lines, enhance our manufacturing and technical
expertise, allow vertical integration, or otherwise complement our business or further our strategic goals.

        Other top-selling products include our HealthPak 100 and CoQuinone 30. 
   Geographic Presence 
         Our products are distributed and sold in 24 markets. We have organized our markets into two geographic regions: (i) Asia Pacific, which includes three sub-regions, and (ii) Americas and Europe, as noted below. 
 10

          
  Asia Pacific 
         Asia Pacific is organized into three sub-regions: Greater China, Southeast Asia Pacific, and North Asia. Markets included in each of these sub-regions are as follows:
 

 Greater ChinaHong Kong, Taiwan, and China. Our business in China is conducted by BabyCare Holdings, Ltd. ("BabyCare"), our
wholly-owned subsidiary 
 Southeast Asia PacificAustralia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia 
 North AsiaJapan and South Korea 

         Asia Pacific has driven our growth the last several years. Since our acquisition of BabyCare in 2010, our strategy in Asia Pacific has been centered on generating growth in mainland China. Consequently, our growth in Asia Pacific over the last few years has been led by China, and we believe that China will continue to drive our growth in this region going forward. We also expect our business to grow in most of our other markets in this region. 
   Americas and Europe 
         Americas and Europe is our most mature region. Over the last few years, net sales in this region have decreased on a constant currency basis due to active Customer declines in several markets within the region including the United States. We continue to implement growth strategies in this region and remain optimistic about our potential to generate growth going forward. During 2018, we opened four new European markets; Germany, Spain, Italy and Romania. These new markets commenced operations late in the second quarter of 2018 and are supported by our European regional headquarters in Paris, France, which allows us to leverage existing infrastructure and efficiently expand our consumer base throughout Europe. 
         Because we have operations in multiple markets, with sales and expenses being generated and incurred in multiple currencies, our reported U.S. dollar sales and earnings can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In general, our operating results are affected positively by a weakening of the U.S. dollar and negatively by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. In 2018, net sales outside of the United States represented approximately 90.2% of consolidated net sales. 
   Research and Development 
         We focus our research and development ("R&D") efforts on developing and bringing to market high-quality, science-based products that promote long-term health and wellness. Our research and development activities include developing products that are new to USANA and new to the industry, updating existing USANA brand formulas to keep them current with the latest science, and adapting existing formulas to meet ever-changing consumer preferences and regulations in global markets. 
         Our scientific staff includes experts on human nutrition, cellular biology, biochemistry, genetics, the microbiome, natural product chemistry, and clinical research. These experts continually review the latest published research on nutrition, present at scientific conferences, and collaborate with third-party researchers and institutions to identify possible new products and product upgrade opportunities. The R&D team is also involved in protecting our proprietary position with exclusive ingredients, proprietary formulations, product-specific scientific validation, and, in some cases, patent protection. Additional research to support our proprietary USANA InCelligence Technology based on cell-signaling and microbiome supplementation continues, with new products being readied for launch in 2019. 
         Our in-house research team has built good working relationships with scientists at a number of universities and research institutes, including the University of Washington, the University of Texas Medical BranchGalveston, the University of Utah, The Foods for Health Institute at The University 
 11

   of California, Davis, Peking University (China), Central Queensland University (Australia), University of Ghent (Belgium) and The University of North Carolina at Pembroke. These relationships help us continue to advance our knowledge, expertise and leadership in several areas of applied human nutrition. 
         When developing and manufacturing our products we follow the highest applicable industry quality standards, as established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), U.S. Pharmacopeia ("USP"), other leading non-governmental agencies ("NGO"), and government agencies. Our ingredients are selected to meet a number of criteria, including, but not limited to: safety, potency, purity, stability, bioavailability, and efficacy. We control the quality of our products throughout all our internal processes, beginning at the formulation stage. We maintain our quality control through controlled sourcing of raw ingredients, manufacturing, packaging, and labeling. 
         In fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018, we expended $8.8 million, $9.0 million, and $10.2 million, respectively, on product research and development activities. Going forward, we expect to continue to increase our spending and resources for research and development to advance our expertise and leadership in cellular nutrition, as well as overall health and wellness. USANA's attention to product quality is a sustainable competitive advantage that we believe also provides a substantial barrier to entry for competitors who wish to enter our space. 
   Manufacturing and Quality Assurance 
         We conduct manufacturing, production and quality control operations for approximately 71% of our products in-house. We have established and maintain a manufacturing and quality control facility in Salt Lake City, Utah. BabyCare manufactures and produces nearly all of its products in-house and maintains manufacturing and quality control facilities in Beijing, China and Tianjin, China. This section of this report gives you more information about our manufacturing, production and quality control operations. 
 Tablet Manufacturing 
         Our tablet production process uses automatic and semi-automatic equipment and includes the following activities:
 

 auditing and qualifying suppliers of raw materials; 
 acquiring raw materials; 
 analyzing raw material quality; 
 weighing or otherwise measuring raw materials; 
 mixing raw materials into batches; 
 forming mixtures into tablets; 
 coating and sorting the tablets; 
 analyzing tablet quality; 
 packaging finished products; and 
 analyzing finished product quality. 

         We conduct sample testing of raw materials, in-process materials, and finished products for purity, potency, and composition to determine whether our products conform to our internal specifications, and we maintain complete documentation for each of these tests. We employ a qualified staff of 
 12

   professionals to develop, implement and maintain a quality system designed to assure that our products are manufactured to our internal and applicable regulatory agency specifications. 
         Our Salt Lake City manufacturing facility is registered with the FDA, Health Canada Natural Health Products Directorate, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration ("TGA"), and other governmental agencies, as required. This facility is audited regularly by these and other various organizations and government agencies to assess, among other things, compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices ("GMPs") and with labeling claims. Additionally, our Salt Lake City manufacturing facility is certified, through inspection and audits, with the Islamic Foods and Nutrition Counsel of America in compliance with Halal, The Organized Kashrus Laboratories in compliance with Kosher, NSF International in compliance with product testing and GMPs, and the TGA in compliance with the current Therapeutic Goods Act in Australia. 
         The manufacture of nutritional or dietary supplements and related products in the United States requires compliance with dietary supplement GMPs, which are based on the food-model GMPs and pharmaceutical GMPs, with additional requirements that are specific to dietary supplements. We are audited by the FDA, specifically for dietary supplements, and have been found in compliance with GMPs for dietary supplements. 
         Our Beijing, China manufacturing facility has historically registered with the China Food and Drug Administration ("CFDA"), and other governmental agencies, as required. Pursuant to a reorganization of certain departments of the Chinese government in 2018, CFDA has now been consolidated into China's new State Administration of Market Regulation ("SAMR"). Our facility in Beijing is audited regularly by various organizations and government agencies to assess, among other things, compliance with applicable GMPs, and with labeling claims. 
   Personal Care Products Manufacturing 
         The production process for personal care products includes identifying and evaluating suppliers of raw materials, acquiring raw materials, analyzing raw material quality, weighing or otherwise measuring the raw materials, mixing raw materials into batches, analyzing liquid batch quality, packaging finished products, and analyzing finished product quality. We conduct sample testing of raw materials, in-process materials, and finished products for purity, potency, and composition to determine whether our products conform to our internal specifications, and we maintain complete documentation for each of these tests. 
         At our Salt Lake City facility, we have standard technology for producing batches of personal care items, and we have semi-automatic packaging equipment for packaging end products. We employ qualified staff to develop, implement, and maintain a quality system. Although the FDA has not promulgated GMPs for personal care items, it has issued guidelines for manufacturing personal care products. We voluntarily maintain compliance with the guidance established by the FDA and the Personal Care Products Council. 
   Third-Party Suppliers and Manufacturers 
         We contract with third-party suppliers and manufacturers for the production of some of our products, which account for approximately 29% of our product sales. These third-party suppliers and manufacturers produce and, in most cases, package these products according to formulations that have been developed by or in conjunction with our in-house product development team. These products include most of our gelatin-capsulated supplements, Rev3 Energy® Drink, Probiotic, our powdered drink mixes, and certain of our personal care products including our new Celavive line for markets outside of China. Products manufactured by third-party suppliers at their locations must also pass through quality control and assurance procedures to ensure they are manufactured in conformance with our specifications. 
 13

     Quality Control and Assurance 
         We have microbiology and analytical chemistry labs in which we conduct quality control processes. In our microbiology laboratory, scientists test for biological contamination of raw materials and finished goods. In our analytical chemistry laboratory, scientists test for chemical contamination and accurate levels of active ingredients in both raw materials and finished products. Scientists also identify and confirm all raw materials used in the manufacturing process through scientifically valid means. Both laboratories conduct stability tests on finished products to determine the shelf life of our products. Our Salt Lake City laboratory staff also performs chemical assays on vitamin and mineral constituents, using USP methods and other internally validated methods. In addition to our quality control and clinical laboratories, our headquarters and China facilities also house a laboratory designated for research and development. 
 Raw Materials 
         Most of the raw ingredients that are used in the manufacture of our products are available from a number of suppliers. We have not generally experienced difficulty in obtaining necessary quantities of raw ingredients. When supplies of certain raw materials have tightened, we have been able to find alternative sources of raw materials, and believe we will be able to do so in the future, if the need arises. Our raw material suppliers must demonstrate stringent process and quality control before we use their products in our manufacturing process. 
Distribution and Marketing 
   General 
         We distribute our products internationally through direct selling, which relies on person-to-person marketing and selling of products. Direct selling is based on the strength of personal relationships and recommendations that frequently come from friends, neighbors, relatives, and close acquaintances. We believe that direct selling is an effective way to distribute our products because it allows person-to-person product education, as well as higher levels of customer service, all of which are not as readily available through other distribution channels. As noted under the caption "Current Focus and Growth Strategy," above, we believe that the future of direct selling is "social sharing" which entails sharing, marketing and selling products through various social media platforms. Consequently, we continue to increase our emphasis on training and educating our Associates to market and sell our products through social sharing. 
 Structure of Direct Selling Program 
  Associates.    A person who wishes to sell USANA products must join our independent sales force as an Associate. A person becomes a USANA Associate by completing an application under the sponsorship of an existing Associate. The new Associate then becomes part of the sponsoring Associate's sales organization. New Associates must agree to adhere to the USANA policies and procedures. Under our policies and procedures, Associates may not, among other things: (i) use deceptive or unlawful practices to sell USANA products; (ii) make deceptive or unlawful claims or representations concerning our products or Compensation Plan; or (iii) sell competitive products to other USANA Associates or solicit USANA Associates to participate in other direct selling opportunities. Associates who violate our policies are subject to discipline, which may include the termination of their purchase and distribution rights. New Associates are required to purchase a starter kit that includes a detailed manual describing our business and products, as well as our policies and procedures. We sell these kits at a nominal price averaging $30 in each of our markets and these kits are fully refundable under our return policy, which is described elsewhere in this report. No other investment is required to become an Associate. 
 14

           Once a person becomes an Associate, she or he may purchase products directly from us at wholesale prices for their personal use and for resale to customers. Our Associates are also entitled to build sales organizations by attracting, enrolling and selling product to new active Customers. Associates are not required to recruit or sponsor new Associates and we do not compensate Associates for sponsoring or recruiting Associates. The sponsoring of new Associates results in the creation of multiple levels within our direct sales structure. Sponsored Associates are referred to as part of the sales organization of the sponsoring Associate. New Associates may also sponsor new Associates and Preferred Customers, creating additional levels in their network, but also forming a part of the same sales organization as the original sponsoring Associate. As outlined below, Associates who are interested in earning income with USANA must successfully sell USANA products and establish a network of product consumers in order to qualify for commissions, including bonuses. Subject to payment of a minimal annual account renewal fee, Associates may continue to distribute or consume our products as long as they adhere to our policies and procedures. 
  Preferred Customers and Retail Customers.    We also sell products directly to Preferred Customers and retail customers who purchase the products only for their personal use. Preferred Customers enroll with USANA, generally through an introduction by an Associate, and purchase product directly from the Company. Retail customers, however, generally purchase directly from Associates. Neither Preferred Customers nor retail customers may resell or distribute our products, regardless of where they purchased them. 
         These various customer programs give us access to a customer market that would otherwise be missed, by targeting consumers who enjoy USANA products, but who prefer not to maintain a distribution relationship with us. Although our policies prohibit customers from engaging in retail sales of products, they may enroll as Associates at any time in the future, if they desire. 
   Associate Training and Motivation 
         Initial training of Associates about USANA, our products and Compensation Plan, and direct selling in general, is provided primarily by an Associate's sponsor and others in the Associate's sales organization. We develop and sell training materials and sales tools to assist Associates in building their businesses, and we provide reprints from commercial publications that feature USANA that may be used as sales tools. We also sponsor and conduct regional, national, and international Associate events, as well as intensive leadership training seminars. Attendance at these sessions is voluntary, and we undertake no generalized effort to provide individualized training to Associates, although experience shows that the most effective and successful Associates tend to be those who participate in such training activities. Although we provide leadership training and sales tools, we ultimately rely on our Associates to sell our products, attract new active Customers to purchase our products, and to educate and train new Associates regarding our products and Compensation Plan. 
 Associate Compensation 
  China Business.    Because of unique business laws and regulations in China governing direct selling that differ materially from our other markets, we operate our business in China through a Chinese subsidiary, BabyCare. The Chinese permit direct selling and have issued regulations that contain a number of financial and operational restrictions. China prohibits pyramid promotion and selling and multi-level compensation systems and has implemented a number of administrative and regulatory methods to control these activities. We have adjusted our direct selling program in China to comply with these laws. 
         BabyCare sells products in China through a variety of methods, including: (a) online through its website; (b) at physical branch retail locations; (c) through direct sellers in provinces and municipalities where BabyCare has received a direct sales license; and (d) through independent distributors who are 
 15

   considered independent business owners under Chinese law. BabyCare's business model has been developed specifically for China's laws and regulations based on, among other things: (i) BabyCare's communications with the Chinese government, (ii) BabyCare's interpretation of the direct selling laws and regulations, as well as its understanding of how the government interprets and enforces the regulations, and (iii) BabyCare's understanding of how other multinational direct selling companies operate in China. 
         Individuals who reside in China and who are interested in being part of USANA's organization in China may do so by enrolling with BabyCare. While the process for enrolling with BabyCare is similar to the process for joining USANA, individuals must initially enroll with BabyCare as a China Preferred Customer, or CPC. CPCs are similar to Preferred Customers in our other markets, but CPCs also have the right in China to refer other CPCs and receive rebates on future product purchases based on the volume of product purchased by CPCs they have referred. A CPC may become a direct seller or independent distributor (collectively referred to as Associates) in China by electing to do so and agreeing to adhere to BabyCare's policies and procedures in China. Our direct sellers in China are permitted by our policies and the terms of our direct selling licenses to sell away from fixed retail locations in the provinces and municipalities where BabyCare has been granted a direct selling license and are compensated under BabyCare's compensation plan. Our independent distributors, who are independent business owners under Chinese law, sell BabyCare products and provide various sales, marketing and other support services to BabyCare and its customers in China. Our distributors in China do not participate in our global Compensation Plan for Associates; instead they are compensated for their services under BabyCare's separate compensation plan established for China. 
         Operating in China involves certain risks and uncertainties to our business, as discussed further in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We endeavor to mitigate these risks and uncertainties through various measures, including by seeking to understand and obey laws and regulations, training our employees and sales force, engaging in dialogue with government officials to better understand their goals and explain our plans, and cooperating in inquiries and other matters of interest to regulators. However, these efforts do not eliminate the significant risks associated with operating in China. 
  Markets Outside China.    This section describes our Compensation Plan generally, except for our China operations as discussed above. 
         Our Compensation Plan provides several opportunities for Associates to earn compensation, provided they are willing to consistently work at (i) sharing, marketing and selling USANA products to consumers, and (ii) building, training, and retaining their sales organizations. The purpose behind each form of compensation under our Compensation Plan is to reward committed Associates for generating product sales either directly or indirectly through their sales organization and network of product consumers. 
         Associates can earn compensation under the Compensation Plan in four ways: 
 

 Commissions.  The primary way an Associate is compensated is through earning
commissions. Associates earn commissions by generating sales volume points, which are a unit of measure of the product sales of their sales organization. Each of our products is assigned a sales
volume point value comprised of a certain percentage of the product price in U.S. dollars. To be eligible to earn commissions, an Associate must sell a certain amount of product each month. Associates
do not earn commissions for simply recruiting and enrolling others in their organization. Commissions are paid only on the sale of products. In most markets, we pay Associates their commissions on a
weekly basis. 
 Bonuses.  We offer Associates several bonus opportunities, including our
leadership bonus, elite bonus, and lifetime matching bonus. These bonus opportunities are based on a 

 16

   

pay-for-performance
philosophy and, therefore, are paid out when the Associate achieves certain performance measures. 


 Retail Mark-Ups.  As discussed previously, in markets where retail mark-ups
are permitted, our Associates purchase products from us at the Preferred Price and may resell them to consumers at higher retail prices. This allows the Associate to retain the retail mark-up as
another form of compensation. 
 Contests and Promotions.  We regularly sponsor contests and promotions
designed to incentivize Associates to generate sales, grow their active Customer base and ultimately increase the number of USANA product users. These promotions are also based on a
pay-for-performance philosophy and, therefore, are only paid upon the achievement of certain objectives. 

         We endeavor to integrate our Compensation Plan seamlessly across all markets (except China) where legally permissible, allowing Associates to receive commissions for globalnot merely localproduct sales. This seamless sales organization structure is designed to allow Associates to build a global network by establishing or expanding their sales organization in any of the markets where we operate. We believe our Compensation Plan significantly enhances our ability to expand internationally, and we intend to continue to integrate new markets, where permitted, into our Compensation Plan. 
   Operating Strengths 
         Our principal objective is to improve the overall health and nutrition of individuals and families around the world. We do this through (i) developing and manufacturing high-quality, science-based nutritional and personal care products that promote long-term health, (ii) personalizing our products to our customers' needs and desires; and (iii) providing an opportunity through direct sales for our Associates who desire to distribute our products and earn supplemental income. Our strategy is to capitalize on our operating strengths, which include: a strong research and development program; significant in-house manufacturing capability; high quality science-based products; an equitable Associate Compensation Plan; a scalable business model; and an experienced management team. 
  Emphasis on Research and Development.    We have a technical team of experienced scientists, including several holding doctoral degrees, quality engineers, and regulatory specialists who contribute to our research and development activities. In our research and development laboratories, our scientists and researchers:


 Investigate activities of natural extracts and formulated products in laboratory and clinical settings; 
 Identify and research combinations of nutrients that may be candidates for new products; 
 Develop new nutritional ingredients for use in supplements; 
 Study the metabolic activities of existing and newly identified nutritional ingredients; 
 Enhance existing USANA brand products, as new discoveries in nutrition and skin care are made; 
 Formulate products to meet diverse regulatory requirements across all of our markets; and 
 Investigate processes for improving the production of our formulated products. 

         Our scientists and researchers also conduct double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical studies, which are intended to further evaluate the efficacy of our products. In addition, we collaborate with outside research organizations to further support various aspects of our research and development efforts. Our in-house research team works closely with scientists at a number of universities and research institutes, including those listed under the caption "Research and Development" above, to maintain our 
 17

   leadership in clinical research in nutrition, oxidative stress, glycemic stress, chronic inflammation and health implications of the microbiome. We have also funded clinical research programs at Boston University, the University of Colorado, the University of Utah, the University of Sydney in Australia, The Orthopedic Specialty Hospital (or "TOSH"), and Utah State University. Our R&D team also works closely with the Medical staff at Sanoviv Medical Institute in Rosarito, Mexico to obtain additional perspectives on the use of supplements in a clinical setting and to get feedback on formulas in development. It is through our internal research and development efforts, as well as our relationships with outside research organizations and health care providers, that we can provide what we believe to be some of the highest quality health products in the industry. 
  In-house Manufacturing.    We manufacture products that account for approximately three-fourths of our product sales. We believe that our ability to manufacture our own products in-house is a significant competitive advantage for the following reasons:
 

 We can better control the quality of raw materials and finished products; 
 We can more reliably monitor the manufacturing process to better guarantee potency and bioavailability and to reduce the risk of product
contamination; 
 We can better control production schedules to increase the likelihood of maintaining an uninterrupted supply of products for our customers; 
 We are able to produce most of our own prototypes in the research phase of product development; and 
 We are better able to manage the underlying costs associated with manufacturing our products. 

  Science-based Quality Products.    As a result of our emphasis on research and development and our in-house manufacturing capabilities, we have developed a line of high-quality health products that we believe provides health benefits to our customers. Our products have been developed based on a combination of published research, in-house laboratory and third-party clinical studies, and sponsored research. 
  Equitable Associate Compensation Plan and Support.    We are committed to increasing our product sales by providing a competitive compensation plan that attracts and retains Associates who constitute our sales force. We motivate our Associates by paying incentives on a weekly basis. Additionally, our Compensation Plan is, where permissible, a global-seamless plan, meaning that Associates can be compensated each week for their business success in any market in which they have product consumers and/or a sales organization where we conduct business. As noted elsewhere in this report, our China operations maintain their own compensation plan, which is structured differently than USANA's plan in other markets. 
         To support our Associates, we sponsor meetings and events throughout the year, where we offer information about our products and our direct selling system. These meetings are designed to assist Associates in business development and to provide a forum for interaction with some of our Associate leaders and with members of the USANA management team. We also provide low-cost sales tools and resources, which we believe are an integral part of building and maintaining a successful home-based business for our Associates. 
         In addition to company-sponsored meetings, sales tools and resources, we maintain a website exclusively for our Associates, where they can access the latest USANA news, obtain training materials, manage their personal information, enroll new customers, shop for products, and register for company-sponsored events. Additionally, through this website, Associates can access other online services to which they may subscribe. For example, we offer an online business management service, which 
 18

   includes a tool that helps Associates track and manage their business activity, a personal webpage to which prospects or retail customers can be directed, and e-cards for advertising. 
         We also believe that recognition is an important factor in supporting and retaining our Associates. We understand that being a successful USANA Associate requires hard work and dedication, and we celebrate key achievements and rank advancements of our Associates. We believe that our recognition programs greatly contribute to our ability to retain our Associates. 
         Business Model.    We believe that our business model provides, among others, the following advantages:
 

 No requirement for a company-employed sales force to sell our products, with a relatively low incremental cost to add a new active Customer; 
 Commissions paid to our Associates are tied to sales performance; 
 Accounts receivable are minimal because payment is required at the time an active Customer purchases product; 
 A stream of recurring revenue from our monthly product subscription program known as "Auto Order," which we utilize in all of our markets (for
the year ended December 29, 2018, this program represented 55% of our product sales volume); and 
 We can typically expand into new international markets with moderate investment because we generally maintain only warehouse facilities,
customer support, and minimal administrative facilities in those international markets. Larger markets, including China however, require more significant local investment. 

  Experienced Management Team.    Our management team includes individuals with expertise in various scientific and managerial disciplines, including direct selling, nutrition, product research and development, international development, marketing, sales, information technology, manufacturing, finance, legal, regulatory, and operations. This team is responsible for supporting growth, research and development, international expansion, strengthening our financial condition, and improving our internal controls. 
   Competition 
         Our industry is very competitive and the barriers to entry are not significant. We compete with manufacturers, distributors, and retailers of nutritional products in many channels, including direct sales, specialty retail stores, wholesale stores, and the internet generally. We also compete with other public and privately owned direct sellers for distributor talent, including for example Amway, Herbalife, and Nu Skin. On both fronts, some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are, have a longer operating history, higher visibility and name recognition, and greater financial resources than we do. We compete with these entities by emphasizing the strengths of our business, as described in the "Operating Strengths" section above, to our Associates, Preferred Customers and potential customers. 
Product Returns 
         Product returns have not been a material factor in our business, totaling approximately 0.7% of net sales in 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. Customer satisfaction has always been and will continue to be a hallmark of our business. We believe that we have always offered a generous product return policy. Our standard return policy allows Associates and Preferred Customers to receive a 100% refund on the sales price of any unused and resalable products that are returned up to one year from the date of purchase. This standard policy differs slightly in a few of our international markets due to applicable regulations in those markets. To avoid manipulation of our Compensation Plan, return of product when 
 19

   the purchase amount exceeds $100 and the product was not damaged at the time of receipt by the Associate may result in cancellation of an Associate's distributorship. 
   Major Customers 
         Sales are made to independent Associates and Preferred Customers. No single Associate or Preferred Customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the nature of our business model results in a significant amount of sales to several different Associate leaders and their sales organizations. Although no single Associate accounted for 10% or more of our net sales, the loss of a key Associate leader or that Associate's sales organization could adversely affect our net sales and our overall operating results. See "Risk Factors." 
Associate Compliance 
         Our reputation depends upon the quality of our products and the integrity of our Associates. We continually monitor and review our Associates' compliance with our policies and procedures as well as the laws and regulations applicable to our business around the world. Part of this review entails an assessment of our Associates' sales activities to ensure that they are actually selling products to consumers. Our policies and procedures require Associates to present our products and the USANA opportunity ethically and honestly. Associates are not permitted to make claims about our products or Compensation Plan that are not consistent with our policies and procedures and applicable laws and regulations. The majority of our Associates must use marketing and promotional materials provided by USANA. Associates who have achieved a certain leadership level are permitted, however, to produce their own marketing and promotional materials, but only if such materials are approved by us prior to their use. 
         In the ordinary course of our business, we encounter Associates who fail to adhere to our policies and procedures. We systematically review reports of alleged Associate misbehavior. Infractions of the policies and procedures are reported to our Ethics and Education group, who determine what, if any, disciplinary action is warranted in each case. More serious infractions are also reported to our Ethics Committee, which includes USANA executives. If we determine that an Associate has violated any of our policies and procedures, we may take a number of disciplinary actions, including warnings, fines or probation. We may also withdraw or deny awards, suspend privileges, withhold commissions until specific conditions are satisfied, or take other appropriate actions in our discretion, including termination of the Associate's purchase and distribution rights 
         Because we believe that Associate compliance is critical to the integrity of our business, we are aggressive in ensuring that our Associates comply with our policies and procedures. When an Associate fails to comply with our policies and procedures, we may terminate the Associate's purchase and distribution rights. From time to time, we become involved in litigation with Associates whose purchase and distribution rights have been terminated. We consider such litigation to be routine and incidental to our business and we will continue to be aggressive in ensuring that our Associates comply with our policies and procedures. 
   Information Technology 
         We believe that the ability to efficiently manage sales, active Customer data, distribution, compensation, manufacturing, inventory, and communication functions through the use of secure, sophisticated, and dependable information processing systems is critical to our success. We continually evaluate changes in the information technology environment to ensure that we are capitalizing on new technologies, keeping pace with regulatory standards, and ensuring that our systems and data are secure. Over the last several years we have meaningfully invested in technology systems and infrastructure to create a better overall customer experience for our customers and we will continue to invest in this area going forward. 
 20



        Our information technology resources are maintained primarily by our in-house staff to optimally support our customer base and core business processes. Our IT staff manages an array of systems and processes which support our global operations 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. Three of our most critical applications include:
 

 A web-based application that provides online services to Associates, such as training sessions and presentations, online shopping, enrollment,
a real-time reporting engine, Company and product information, web-hosting, email, and other tools to help Associates effectively manage their business and sales organizations. 
 A web-based order-entry system that handles order entry, customer information, compensation, Associate business structure, returns, invoices,
and other transactional-based processes. 
 A fully integrated world-wide Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system that handles accounting, human resources, inventory management,
production processes, quality assurance, and reporting requirements in a multinational environment. 

         Our web applications are supported by a clustered environment providing high availability. All production systems are fully backed-up and stored off-site to mitigate the risk of significant interruption of our business in the event of a disaster at the locations of our primary servers. 
         For information regarding technology-related risks, see the information in "Item 1A: Risk Factors" under the caption "We rely on information technology to support our operations and reporting environments. A security failure of that technology could impact our ability to operate our businesses effectively, adversely affect our reported financial results, impact our reputation and expose us to potential liability or litigation." 
   Regulatory Matters 
  General.    In every jurisdiction in which we operate, our business is subject to extensive governmental regulation. These regulations exist at various national and local levels and pertain to our products, direct selling, and other aspects of our business. In this section, we describe the regulations that are applicable to our business. 
         Product Regulation.    Numerous governmental agencies regulate the formulation, manufacturing, holding, packaging, labeling, advertising, promoting, importing, distributing, shipping, and selling of health supplements, cosmetics, and foods. In the United States, these agencies include, for example, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") under the FTC Act, the FDA, under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") and related regulations, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Customs and Border Patrol, and the United States Postal Service. 
         Our largest selling product group includes products that are regulated as dietary supplements under the FDCA. Dietary supplements are also regulated in the United States under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 ("DSHEA"), which we believe is generally favorable to the dietary supplement industry. Some of our powdered drink, food bar, and other nutrition products are regulated as foods under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 ("NLEA"). The NLEA establishes requirements for ingredient and nutritional labeling including product labeling claims. The manufacture of nutritional or dietary supplements and related products in the United States requires compliance with dietary supplement GMPs, which are based on the food-model GMPs and Pharmaceutical GMPs, with additional requirements that are specific to dietary supplements. We are audited annually by the FDA, specifically for dietary supplements and have been found in compliance with GMPs for dietary supplements. The Dietary Supplement & Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act requires manufacturers of dietary supplement and over-the-counter products to notify the FDA when they receive reports of serious adverse events occurring within the 
 21

   United States. We have an internal adverse event reporting system that has been in place for several years, and we believe that we are in compliance with this law. 
         In general, our personal care products, which are regulated as cosmetic products by the FDA, are not subject to pre-market approval by that agency. Cosmetics, however, are subject to regulation by the FDA under the adulteration and misbranding provisions of the FDCA. Cosmetics also are subject to specific labeling regulations, including warning statements, if the safety of a cosmetic is not adequately substantiated or if the product may be hazardous, as well as ingredient statements and other packaging requirements under The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. Cosmetics that meet the definition of a drug, such as sunscreens, are regulated as drugs. Over-the-counter ("OTC") drug products, including cosmetics, may be marketed if they conform to the requirements of the OTC monograph that is applicable to that drug. Drug products not conforming to monograph requirements require an approved New Drug Application ("NDA") before marketing may begin. Under these provisions, if the agency were to find that a product or ingredient of one of our OTC drug products is not generally recognized as safe and effective or is not included in a final monograph that is applicable to one of our OTC drug products, we would be required to reformulate or cease marketing that product until it is the subject of an approved NDA or until the time, if ever, that the monograph is amended to include such product. 
         Advertising of our products in the United States is subject to regulation by the FTC under the FTC Act. Under the FTC's Substantiation Doctrine, an advertiser is required to have a "reasonable basis" for all objective product claims before the claims are made. Failure to adequately substantiate claims may be considered either deceptive or unfair practices. Pursuant to this FTC requirement, we are required to have adequate substantiation for all material advertising claims that we make for our products in the United States. In recent years, the FTC has initiated numerous investigations of and actions against companies that sell dietary supplement, weight-management, and cosmetic products. The FTC has issued guidance to assist companies in understanding and complying with its substantiation requirement. We believe that we have adequate substantiation for all material advertising claims that we make for our products in the United States, and we believe that we have organized the documentation to support our advertising and promotional practices in compliance with these guidelines. However, no assurance can be given that the FTC would reach the same conclusion if it were to review or question our substantiation for our advertising claims in the United States. 
         The FTC may enforce compliance with the law in a variety of ways, both administratively and judicially, using compulsory process, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement can result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, corrective advertising, consumer redress, divestiture of assets, rescission of contracts, and such other relief as the agency deems necessary to protect the public. Violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. Although, to our knowledge, we have not been the subject of any action by the FTC, no assurance can be given that the FTC will not question our advertising or other operations in the United States in the future. Any action in the future by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products in the United States. 
         The manufacturing, labeling, and advertising of our products are also regulated by various governmental agencies outside the United States in each country where they are distributed. In Australia, product registration, labeling and manufacturing is regulated by the TGA. In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare regulates these activities. In China, SAMR regulates these activities. Upon entering a new market, prior to commencing operations or marketing products, we may be required to obtain approvals, licenses, or certifications from that country's Food Administration, Ministry of Health or comparable agency. Approvals or licensing may be conditioned on reformulation of USANA products for the particular market or approval or licensing otherwise may be unavailable with respect to certain products or product ingredients in a given market. 
 22

           We must also comply with local product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country. For example, China extensively regulates the registration, labeling and marketing of our products. In China, our nutritional products are typically classified as "health functional foods" and our personal care products are typically classified as "non-special use cosmetics." The registration process for health functional foods is complex and can be unpredictable. It generally requires extensive analysis and approval by the SAMR. As a result, it can take several years to register a product as a health functional food in China. While all products currently sold by BabyCare in China have been registered with the SAMR, we continue to work through the registration process for other health functional food products, which we also hope to begin selling through BabyCare in the future. 
         We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business. Future changes could include requirements for the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, the recall or discontinuation of certain products that cannot be reformulated, additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, and additional scientific substantiation. Any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. 
  Direct Selling Regulation.    Various laws and regulations in all of our markets regulate direct selling. These laws and regulations exist at many levels of government in many different forms, including statutes, rules, regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative orders. Generally, the regulations are directed at: (i) ensuring that product sales ultimately are made to consumers and that advancement within a sales organization is based on product sales rather than on investments in the organization or on other criteria that are not related to sales; and (ii) preventing the use of deceptive or fraudulent practices that have sometimes been inappropriately associated with legitimate direct selling activities. Direct selling regulations are inherently fact-based and often do not include "bright line" rules. In most of our markets, these regulations are subject to discretionary interpretation by regulators and respective legal authority. Consequently, the regulations, or a regulator's interpretation and enforcement of the regulations, could change at any time. If that were to occur, we may be required to change our business model in the respective market in an effort to comply. 
         In the United States, the FTC has jurisdiction to regulate direct selling companies under the FTC Act. The FTC's interpretation of the applicable direct selling laws and regulations has evolved over the last several years as represented in various consent orders between the FTC and certain direct selling companies relating to a variety of consumer protection issues, including misleading earnings representations by a company's independent distributors, as well as the fairness and legal validity of a company's business model and distributor compensation plan. For instance, in July 2016, the FTC entered into a consent order with a direct selling company following an enforcement action in which the FTC had alleged that, among other things, the direct selling company's distributors were making misleading representations regarding income and that the company was utilizing an unfair and deceptive compensation plan. Additionally, in September 2016, the FTC entered into a consent order with another direct selling company following an enforcement action in which the FTC had alleged that the company's distributors were making misleading earnings representations and that the company was utilizing an illegal business model. In each of these settlements, the FTC required the censured company to pay a significant fine, revise its U.S. business model and compensation plan to comply with various restrictions on how it can compensate independent distributors and to make changes to its marketing practices to avoid misleading income representations. FTC determinations such as these have created ambiguity as to the proper interpretation of the law and regulations applicable to direct selling companies in the U.S. Although these settlements do not represent judicial precedent or have the force of law or a new rule or regulation, FTC officials have indicated that the direct selling industry should look to the principles underlying these consent orders for guidance in their own businesses. 
 23

           Additionally, in January 2018, the FTC issued its non-binding Business Guidance Concerning Multi-Level Marketing, which it intended to reinforce many of the principles contained in the consent orders described above and to provide other operational guidance to direct selling companies. We have analyzed the consent orders and the Business Guidance issued by the FTC and are in the process of both (i) refining aspects of our U.S. business model based on the principles contained in these documents, and (ii) conducting additional analysis to determine if further changes to our model may be necessary. We cannot assure you that the FTC, if it were to review our U.S. business, would not require us to change one or more aspects of our operations in the U.S. in the future. Any action against us in the future by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our operations in the U.S. 
         The Chinese government has adopted direct selling laws and regulations that contain a number of financial and operational restrictions on direct selling companies, as well as prohibitions on pyramid selling and multi-level compensation. These regulations are also subject to discretionary interpretation and enforcement by various municipal, provincial and state officials in China. Departments within the Chinese government that regulate direct selling include, the Ministry of Commerce ("MOFCOM"), the Ministry of Public Security ("MPS") and their local counterparts. BabyCare's business model has been developed specifically for China's laws and regulations based on, among other things: (i) BabyCare's communications with the Chinese government, (ii) BabyCare's interpretation of the direct selling laws and regulations, as well as its understanding of how the government interprets and enforces the regulations, and (iii) BabyCare's understanding of how other multinational direct selling companies operate in China. 
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, the direct selling industry in China, as well as the regulatory environment for that industry, continues to evolve and receive significant attention and scrutiny from the Chinese government and the media in China. For example, in January 2019, following unfavorable media coverage of certain health product companies and direct selling companies, several departments of the Chinese government, including SAMR, MPS, and MOFCOM, initiated a 100-day review of health product and direct selling companies in China. This 100-day review requires direct-selling companies such as BabyCare to conduct a self-assessment of the regulatory compliance of their business (including product regulatory compliance and direct selling regulatory compliance) and to provide information to the government regarding the same. The 100-day review will also entail a review of a company's regulatory compliance by various departments of the Chinese government. During this review period, the Chinese government has, among other things, (i) instructed direct selling companies to not hold large distributor meetings, and (ii) suspended its application review process for direct sales licenses and authorizations. 
         Prior to 2019, including in 2017 following various media reports, certain departments of the Chinese government, including the SAMR and MPS, carried out a three-month review of the direct selling industry to investigate alleged violations of the direct selling regulations and anti-pyramiding regulations. The Chinese government has taken action historically against direct selling companies that it believes have violated the government's direct selling regulations and anti-pyramiding laws. The government's action in this regard has entailed investigating direct selling companies and their distributors, imposing significant fines and, in some cases, shutting down companies. Historically, there have been instances when inquiries or complaints about BabyCare's business resulted in warnings from the Chinese government, as well as the payment of fines by BabyCare or its distributors. 
         BabyCare has obtained direct selling licenses in certain provinces and municipalities, and it must obtain various licenses and approvals from additional municipalities and provinces within China if it is to operate its direct selling business model in China. As of the date of this report, BabyCare has been granted licenses to engage in direct selling in the municipalities and provinces of Beijing, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, and Tianjin. In 2016, BabyCare received preliminary approval from the Chinese government to expand its direct selling business into the following eight additional provinces and municipalities: Liaoning Province, Shandong Province, Shanxi Province, Sichuan Province, Guangdong Province, Dalian 
 24

   City, Qingdao City, and Shenzhen City. Issuance of final direct selling approvals for these municipalities and provinces was contingent upon BabyCare satisfying certain conditions and reporting requirements. Although BabyCare has been working to satisfy these conditions and reporting requirements, we now believe that BabyCare will not be issued the final direct selling approvals for some or all of these eight additional provinces and municipalities under the current applications due to (i) delays by BabyCare in completing the same, (ii) the reorganization of several departments of the Chinese government in 2018, (iii) the Chinese government's 100-day review of the direct sales industry, which commenced in January 2019, and/or (iv) the related suspension of the Chinese government's application review process for direct sales licenses and approvals during the 100-day review. Consequently, we anticipate that BabyCare will need to reapply for these approvals at some point following the 100-day review period. Due to the unpredictability created by these complications, and the discretion maintained by the Chinese government, there is no guarantee that BabyCare will be successful in reapplying for these approvals or that the Chinese government will ultimately grant BabyCare a direct sales license in these or in other jurisdictions, which could delay or adversely affect BabyCare's growth and business. 
         Direct selling companies, and the industry in general, continue to experience significant media and public scrutiny in many countries. Several companies similar to ours recently have been scrutinized and penalized in several markets where we operate, including the United States, Canada, China, Japan, and South Korea. This scrutiny, along with the uncertainty of the laws and regulations pertaining to direct selling in many countries, can affect how a regulator or member of the public, including investors, perceive us. For instance, there has been significant media and short-seller attention given to the viability and legality of direct selling in the United States and China over the past few years. This attention has led to intense public scrutiny of our industry, as well as volatility in our stock price and the stock prices of other direct selling companies who operate in the same markets. We cannot predict the impact that this scrutiny may have on our business or industry in the future. 
         We detail more of the various risks associated with our business in this report in Item 1A. "Risk Factors." 
  Transfer Pricing Regulation.    In the United States and many other countries, we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations that are designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported by our U.S. or international entities and are taxed accordingly. We have adopted transfer prices, which are supported by formal transfer pricing studies for the sale of products to our subsidiaries in accordance with applicable transfer pricing laws. In addition, we have entered into agreements with our subsidiaries for services and other contractual obligations, such as the payment of Associate incentives that are also supported by the same formal transfer pricing studies. If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge these agreements or require changes in our standard transfer pricing practices for products, we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings could be adversely affected. The tax treaties between the United States and most countries provide competent authority for relief to avoid any double taxation. We believe that we operate in compliance with all applicable transfer pricing regulations. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with transfer pricing regulations or that those laws will not be modified, which may require that we change our operating procedures. 
   Intellectual Property 
  Trademarks.    We have developed and use registered trademarks in our business, particularly relating to our corporate and product names. We own 30 trademarks that are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Federal registration of a trademark enables the registered owner of the mark to bar the unauthorized use of the registered mark in connection with a similar product in the same channels of trade by any third-party anywhere in the United States, regardless of whether the registered owner has ever used the trademark in the area where the unauthorized use occurs. We have 
 25

   filed applications and own trademark registrations, and we intend to register additional trademarks in countries outside the United States where USANA products are or may be sold in the future. Protection of registered trademarks in some jurisdictions may not be as extensive as the protection in the United States. 
         We also claim ownership and protection of certain product names, unregistered trademarks, and service marks under common law. Common law trademark rights do not provide the same level of protection that is afforded by the registration of a trademark. In addition, common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used. We believe these trademarks, whether registered or claimed under common law, constitute valuable assets, adding to recognition of USANA and the effective marketing of USANA products. Trademark registration once obtained is essentially perpetual, subject to the payment of a renewal fee. We therefore believe that these proprietary rights have been and will continue to be important in enabling us to compete. 
  Trade Secrets.    We own certain intellectual property, including trade secrets that we seek to protect, in part, through operational protections and confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, vendors and other parties. Even where these agreements exist, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors. Our proprietary product formulations are generally considered trade secrets, but are not otherwise protected under intellectual property laws. 
  Patents.    We have two U.S. patents that relate to the method of extracting an antioxidant from olives and the byproducts of olive oil production. These patents were issued in 2002 and will continue in force until December 20, 2019. 
         We intend to protect our legal rights concerning intellectual property by all appropriate legal action. Consequently, we may become involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of any of the foregoing proprietary rights. Any intellectual property litigation could result in substantial cost and divert the efforts of management and technical personnel. 
   Seasonality 
         Although we are not significantly affected by seasonality, we do experience variations in the activity of our Associates in many of our markets in the first and fourth quarters around major cultural events such as Chinese New Year and Christmas. 
Backlog 
         Our products are typically shipped within 72 hours after receipt of an order. As of February 22, 2019 we had no significant backlog of orders. 
   Working Capital Practices 
         We maintain sufficient amounts of inventory in stock in order to provide a high level of service to our customers. Substantial inventories are required to meet the needs of our dual role as manufacturer and distributor. We also watch seasonal commodity markets and may buy ahead of normal demand to hedge against cost increases and supply risks. 
Environment Laws 
         We are not aware of any instance in which we have contravened federal, state, or local laws relating to protection of the environment or in which we otherwise may be subject to liability for environmental conditions that could materially affect operations.

     Employees 
         As of February 22, 2019 we had approximately 1,911 employees worldwide, as measured by full-time equivalency. Our employees are not currently represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have not experienced work stoppages as a result of labor disputes. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees.
