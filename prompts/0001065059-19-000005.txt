Item 1. Business
Overview
Centrus Energy Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Centrus” or the “Company”), is a trusted supplier of nuclear fuel and services for the nuclear power industry. References to “Centrus”, the “Company”, or “we” include Centrus Energy Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries as well as the predecessor to Centrus, unless the context otherwise indicates. We were incorporated in 1998 as part of the privatization of the United States Enrichment Corporation.
Centrus operates two business segments: low-enriched uranium (“LEU”), which supplies various components of nuclear fuel to utilities, and contract services, which provides advanced engineering, design, and manufacturing services to government and private sector customers.
Our LEU business involves the sale of low-enriched uranium, its components, and natural uranium to utilities operating commercial nuclear power plants. LEU is a critical component in the production of nuclear fuel for reactors that produce electricity. We supply LEU to both domestic and international utilities for use in nuclear reactors worldwide. We provide LEU from multiple sources including our inventory, medium- and long- term supply contracts and spot purchases. As a long-term supplier of LEU to our customers, our objective is to provide value through the reliability and diversity of our supply sources. Our long-term goal is to resume commercial enrichment production, and we are exploring approaches to that end.
Our contract services segment utilizes the unique technical expertise, operational experience and specialized facilities that we developed over nearly two decades as part of our uranium enrichment technology program. We are leveraging these capabilities to expand and diversify our business, offering new services to existing and new customers in complementary markets.
With the specialized capabilities and workforce at our Technology and Manufacturing Center in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, we are performing technical, engineering and manufacturing services for a range of commercial and government customers and actively working to secure new customers. Our experience developing, licensing and manufacturing advanced nuclear fuels and technologies positions us to provide critical design, engineering, manufacturing and other services to a broad range of potential clients, including those involving sensitive or classified technologies. This work includes design, engineering, manufacturing and licensing services support for advanced reactor and fuel fabrication projects. Based on our experience at our uranium enrichment facilities, we are also performing decontamination and decommissioning (“D&D”) work for the U.S. government in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. 
With our several decades of experience in enrichment, we also continue to be a leader in the development of an advanced U.S. uranium enrichment technology, which we believe could play a critical role in supplying fuel for advanced reactors, meeting U.S. national and energy security needs, and achieving our nation’s nonproliferation objectives. To support U.S. energy and national security, we have been performing research and demonstration work on our advanced gas centrifuge uranium enrichment technology through contracts with UT-Battelle, LLC (“UT-Battelle”), the management and operating contractor of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (“ORNL”) for the United States Department of Energy (“DOE”). 
The nuclear industry in general, and the nuclear fuel industry in particular, is in a period of significant change, which continues to affect the competitive landscape. In the seven years following the 2011 Fukushima accident, the published market prices for uranium enrichment declined more than 75 percent.  While the monthly price indicators have gradually increased starting in September 2018, the uranium enrichment segment of the nuclear fuel market remains oversupplied and faces uncertainty about future demand for nuclear power generation. Changes in the competitive landscape affect pricing trends, change customer spending patterns, and create uncertainty. To address these changes, we have taken steps to adjust our cost structure and may seek further adjustments to our cost 
4

structure and operations and to evaluate opportunities to grow our business organically or through acquisitions and other strategic transactions.
We are also actively considering, and expect to consider from time to time in the future, potential strategic transactions, which could involve, without limitation, acquisitions and/or dispositions of businesses or assets, joint ventures or investments in businesses, products or technologies. In connection with any such transaction, we may seek additional debt or equity financing, contribute or dispose of assets, assume additional indebtedness, or partner with other parties to consummate a transaction.
Our Business Today
In 2018, our management team led the Company’s successful efforts to add new sales and customers to the LEU order book, to diversify our supply at reduced cost, to expand into new areas of the nuclear power and complementary industries, and to reduce our future selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) costs. We have worked to diversify our supply and revenue streams and position ourselves for long-term financial strength as we seek to remain a trusted partner to the global nuclear industry and return value to our shareholders. Our competitive strengths include:

• | Positioned for the long term: We have long-term nuclear fuel sales and supply contracts in place that extend to 2030; these contracts will provide a stream of revenue for many years and provide a foundation for growth. Because we do not have the large capital and overhead costs of a commercial production facility, we are positioned to continue to obtain supply of LEU from an oversupplied market experiencing prices near their historic lows, which we believe will strengthen our position for the future.


• | Diverse supply portfolio: In 2018, we entered into new agreements with suppliers of enriched uranium, diversifying and expanding our sources of supply and improving our logistics for delivery of enriched uranium. In addition, we have acquired access to additional enriched uranium supply from the excess inventories of utility operators of nuclear power plants and from other primary and secondary sources of enriched uranium supply. Our strategy is to remain a highly diversified and reliable supplier of LEU with the flexibility to meet the evolving needs of our customers and effectively compete in the marketplace.


• | Engineering, design, and manufacturing capabilities: Our expertise and world-leading technical, engineering and manufacturing capabilities in Oak Ridge, Tennessee are creating new opportunities. First, we are leveraging our domestic enrichment experience and engineering know-how to assist private sector customers in production of fuel for next-generation nuclear reactors and the development of related facilities. Second, we are leveraging our significant experience in advanced manufacturing to support contract design, prototyping, and precision manufacturing work for commercial and government clients.


• | Enrichment technology development: We have continued to advance our U.S. centrifuge technology in specialized facilities in Oak Ridge so that it could be deployed if and when needed for national security, advanced reactor fuel, or other government purposes, and/or deployed at a commercial scale enrichment facility over the long term once market conditions will support new capacity.

We believe that our position as a leading provider of enriched uranium and our long-standing global relationships will enable us to increase our future market share in the nuclear fuel market and support our growth into complementary areas of the nuclear and other industries. We are well-positioned to capitalize on our heritage, industry-wide relationships, and diversity of supply to provide reliable and competitive sources of nuclear fuel and services. Centrus continues to be valued by our customers as a source of diversity, stability, and competition in the enrichment market.

Uranium and Enrichment
LEU consists of two components: separative work units (“SWU”) and uranium. Uranium is a naturally occurring element and is mined from deposits located in Kazakhstan, Canada, Australia, and several other countries including the United States. According to the World Nuclear Association (“WNA”), there are adequate measured resources of uranium to fuel nuclear power at current usage rates for about 90 years. In its natural state, uranium is principally comprised of two isotopes: uranium-235 (“U235”) and uranium-238 (“U238”). The concentration of U235 in natural uranium is only 0.711% by weight. Most commercial nuclear power reactors require LEU fuel with a U235 concentration greater than natural uranium and up to 5% by weight. Future reactor designs currently under development will likely require higher U235 concentration levels of up to 20%. Uranium enrichment is the process by which the concentration of U235 is increased to that level. 
SWU is a standard unit of measurement that represents the effort required to transform a given amount of natural uranium into two components: enriched uranium having a higher percentage of U235 and depleted uranium having a lower percentage of U235. The SWU contained in LEU is calculated using an industry standard formula based on the physics of enrichment. The amount of enrichment deemed to be contained in LEU under this formula is commonly referred to as its SWU component and the quantity of natural uranium deemed to be contained in LEU under this formula is referred to as its uranium or “feed” component. 
While in some cases customers purchase both the SWU and uranium components of LEU from us, utility customers typically provide uranium to us as part of their enrichment contracts, and in exchange we deliver LEU to these customers and charge for the SWU component. Title to uranium provided by customers generally remains with the customer until delivery of LEU, at which time title to LEU is transferred to the customer, and we take title to the uranium.
The following outlines the steps for converting natural uranium into LEU fuel, commonly known as the nuclear fuel cycle:
Mining and Milling. Natural, or unenriched, uranium is removed from the earth in the form of ore and then crushed and concentrated. 
Conversion. Uranium concentrates (“U3O8”) are combined with fluorine gas to produce uranium hexafluoride (“UF6”), a solid at room temperature and a gas when heated. UF6 is shipped to an enrichment plant. 
Enrichment. UF6 is enriched in a process that increases the concentration of the U235 isotope in the UF6 from its natural state of 0.711% up to 5%, or LEU, which is usable as a fuel for current light water commercial nuclear power reactors. Future commercial reactor designs may use uranium enriched up to 20% U235, or HALEU.
Fuel Fabrication. LEU is then converted to uranium oxide and formed into small ceramic pellets by fabricators. The pellets are loaded into metal tubes that form fuel assemblies, which are shipped to nuclear power plants.
Nuclear Power Plant. The fuel assemblies are loaded into nuclear reactors to create energy from a controlled chain reaction. Nuclear power plants generate approximately 20% of U.S. electricity and 11% of the world’s electricity.
Used Fuel Storage. After the nuclear fuel has been in a reactor for several years, its efficiency is reduced and the assembly is removed from the reactor’s core. The used fuel is warm and radioactive and is kept in a deep pool of water for several years. Many utilities have elected to then move the used fuel into steel or concrete and steel casks for interim storage.

Products and Services
We operate the following two business segments: (1) Low-Enriched Uranium and (2) Contract Services.
Low-Enriched Uranium 
Revenue from our LEU segment is derived primarily from:

• | sales of the SWU component of LEU,


• | sales of both the SWU and uranium components of LEU, and


• | sales of natural uranium.

Revenue for our LEU segment accounted for approximately 85% of our total revenue in 2018. Our customers are primarily domestic and international utilities that operate nuclear power plants. Our agreements with electric utilities are primarily long-term, fixed-commitment contracts under which our customers are obligated to purchase a specified quantity of the SWU component of LEU (or the SWU and uranium components of LEU) from us. Our agreements for natural uranium sales are generally shorter-term, fixed-commitment contracts.
Contract Services
Our Contract Services segment reflects our technical, manufacturing and engineering services offered to our public and private sector customers. Our public-sector work has primarily focused on the American Centrifuge engineering and testing activities we have performed as a contractor for UT-Battelle. In addition, we are now performing D&D work for DOE at its facilities in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
With our private-sector customers, we seek to leverage our domestic enrichment experience, engineering know-how, and advanced manufacturing capabilities, to assist customers with a range of engineering, design, and precision manufacturing projects, including the production of fuel for next-generation nuclear reactors and the development of related facilities. Our contracts with private sector and government customers are usually time-and-material or fixed-priced based and require delivery of contracted services or manufactured materials specified by the customer. 
SWU and Uranium Sales Order Book
The SWU component of LEU is typically bought and sold under long-term contracts with deliveries over several years. The Company’s agreements for natural uranium sales are generally shorter-term, fixed-commitment contracts. Our order book of sales under contract in the LEU segment (“order book”) extends to 2030. As of December 31, 2018, our order book was $1.0 billion compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2017, reflecting completed deliveries and new contracts signed in 2018 and rejection of a contract by a customer in bankruptcy proceedings. As of December 31, 2017, we had estimated that approximately 14% of our order book was at risk due to factors including customer financial conditions. We estimate that as of December 31, 2018, approximately 4% of our order book is at risk related to customer financial conditions or operations. 
We anticipate our SWU and uranium revenue from the sales currently under contract in our order book will be in a range of $85 million to $120 million during 2019. Most of our contracts provide for fixed purchases of SWU during a given year. Our estimate of the aggregate dollar amount of future SWU and uranium sales is partially based on customers’ estimates of the timing and size of their fuel requirements and other assumptions that are subject to change. For example, depending on the terms of specific contracts, the customer may be able to increase or decrease the quantity delivered within an agreed range. Our order book estimate is also based on our estimates of selling prices, which are subject to change. For example, depending on the terms of specific contracts, prices may be adjusted based on escalation using a general inflation index, published SWU price indicators prevailing at the time of delivery, and other factors, all of which are variable. We use external composite forecasts of future market prices 
7

and inflation rates in our pricing estimates. Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a discussion of risks related to our order book.
Suppliers
We have a diverse base of supply that includes:

• | existing inventory of LEU,


• | mid- and long-term contracts with enrichment producers,


• | secondary suppliers including utility operators of nuclear power plants that have excess inventory, and


• | spot purchases of SWU and uranium.

We have and will seek to continue to further diversify this base of supply and take advantage of the opportunities to obtain additional short and long-term supplies of LEU at prices consistent with the current market. 

Currently, our largest suppliers of SWU are the Russian government entity Joint Stock Company “TENEX” (“TENEX”) and the French government owned company Orano Cycle (formerly, AREVA NC) (“Orano”). 
Under an agreement with TENEX (the “Russian Supply Agreement”), we purchase SWU contained in LEU received from TENEX, and we deliver natural uranium to TENEX for the LEU’s uranium component. The Russian Supply Agreement was originally signed with commitments through 2022 but was modified in 2015 to give us the right to reschedule certain quantities of SWU of the original commitments into the period 2023 and beyond, in return for the purchase of additional SWU in those years. If we exercise this right to reschedule in full during the remaining years of the contract’s original term, we will have a rescheduled post-2022 purchase commitment through 2028. 
Under the Russian Supply Agreement, we pay for the SWU contained in the LEU delivered to us, and either supply natural uranium to TENEX for the uranium content of the LEU or, in limited cases, pay for such content. SWU pricing is determined by a formula that uses a combination of market-related price points and other factors. The LEU that we obtain from TENEX under the Russian Supply Agreement is currently subject to quotas and other restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to sell the purchased enrichment in the United States and other markets. The Russian Supply Agreement only gives us the right to use a portion of this quota, which is less than the amount of Russian LEU that we need to order to meet our SWU purchase obligations to TENEX. We can ask TENEX to make additional quota available to us, sell the SWU in foreign markets or secure a deferral to a future year of the portion of the purchase obligation under the Russian Supply Agreement for which we have insufficient quota. In the past we have been able to reach agreement with TENEX to either secure additional quota or defer our obligation, but TENEX’s willingness to enter into such agreements in the future is not known. Refer below to —Competition and Foreign Trade - Limitations on Imports of LEU from Russia.
We expect that a portion of the Russian LEU that we order during the term of the Russian Supply Agreement will need to be delivered to customers who will use it in foreign reactors. The Russian LEU that we deliver to foreign customers can be delivered either at fabrication facilities in the U.S. or in foreign countries. The amount of SWU we must purchase from TENEX under the Russian Supply Agreement exceeds our current sales order book and, therefore, we will need to make new sales for deliveries in 2023 and beyond to place all the Russian LEU we must order to meet our SWU purchase obligations to TENEX. In addition, due to quotas and other limitations, not all of our delivery obligations under our existing contracts can be met with Russian LEU. 
In April 2018, we entered into an agreement (the “Orano Supply Agreement”) with Orano for the long-term supply of SWU contained in LEU, nominally commencing in 2023. Under the Orano Supply Agreement, we will purchase SWU contained in LEU received from Orano, and then deliver natural uranium to Orano for the natural uranium feed material component of LEU. We may elect to begin to accept deliveries as early as 2021 or to defer 
8

the commencement of purchases until 2024 and have the option to extend the six-year purchase period for an additional two years. The Orano Supply Agreement provides significant flexibility to adjust purchase volumes, subject to annual minimums and maximums in fixed amounts that vary year by year. The pricing for the SWU purchased by us is determined by a formula that uses a combination of market-related price points and other factors, and is subject to certain floors and ceilings. Prices are payable in a combination of U.S. dollars and euros.
We procure LEU from other sources under short-term and long-term contracts and have inventories available that diversify our supply portfolio and provide flexibility to meet the needs of our customers.
Market prices for SWU fell substantially in the aftermath of the nuclear incident at Fukushima, Japan in 2011. Recent purchases of SWU and our long-term contract with Orano reflect this decline in market prices. We signed our large, long-term supply agreement with TENEX in 2011. Prices under the Russian Supply Agreement also have been adjusted to reflect lower market prices based on a one-time market related price reset that was agreed when we signed the contract in 2011. The reset occurred in 2018 for purchases we make in 2019 and beyond, decreasing the unit costs per SWU for the duration of the contract.
The cost of sales per SWU reported in our financial statements are calculated by applying the average cost method to our entire inventory, including higher priced purchases we made in earlier years. Consequently, we expect our future costs of goods sold per SWU to significantly decrease over time beginning in 2019, as product is sold and revenue and costs are recognized. Given the unpredictability of the market and other factors, including pending U.S. government trade proceedings, there can be no assurance that the expected improvement will be realized near term. 

Advanced Technology, Manufacturing, and Engineering Capability
We have a long record as a global leader in advanced technology, manufacturing and engineering. Our manufacturing, engineering and testing facilities and our highly-trained workforce are deeply engaged in developing advanced nuclear fuel solutions, providing engineering and precision manufacturing services, and advancing the next generation of uranium enrichment technology. 
We are exploring a number of options for returning to domestic production in the future. The economics for commercial deployment of new enrichment capacity are severely challenged by the current supply/demand imbalance in the market for LEU and related downward pressure on market prices for SWU, which reached a historic low in August 2018. Market conditions, however, improved at the end of 2018 and are expected to improve further in the long term.
In February 2016, we completed a successful three-year demonstration of our American Centrifuge technology, with 120 advanced uranium enrichment gas centrifuge machines linked together in a cascade to simulate industrial operating conditions. Since September 2015, our government contracts with UT-Battelle have provided for continued engineering and testing work on the American Centrifuge technology at our facilities in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. On October 26, 2017, we entered into a contract with UT-Battelle for the period from October 1, 2017, through September 30, 2018. The contract provided for fixed payments upon completion of defined milestones and generated total revenue of $16.0 million. Funding for the program was provided to UT-Battelle by the federal government. Although the most recent contract expired September 30, 2018, we continue to perform work towards the expected milestones as the parties work toward a successor agreement; however, we have no assurance that a successor agreement will be executed.
On January 7, 2019, DOE issued a Notice of Intent to contract with Centrus to deploy a cascade of centrifuges to demonstrate the ability to produce HALEU, suitable for a range of military and civilian applications. While existing reactors currently in operation typically operate on LEU enriched so that the uranium-235 isotope concentration is just below 5%, HALEU has a uranium-235 concentration of up to 20%. HALEU is not commercially available today, but may be required in the future for a number of advanced reactor designs currently under development, for DOE nonproliferation efforts, or for some advanced fuel designs that may be suitable in the future for existing 
9

reactors. There are no guarantees about whether or when government or commercial demand for HALEU will materialize, and there are a number of technical, regulatory and economic hurdles that must be overcome for these fuels and reactors to come to the market. Additionally, while Centrus has begun contract discussions with DOE about the proposed demonstration project, there is no assurance that a contract will be executed or that the project will go forward.
On March 26, 2018, we entered into a services agreement with X Energy, LLC (“X-energy”) to provide X-energy with (i) technical and resource support for criticality safety evaluation of processing equipment, design of fresh fuel transport packages, and conceptual mock-up of a nuclear fuel production facility and (ii) non-cash in-kind contributions subject to a cooperative agreement between X-energy and the United States government. The services were performed pursuant to separate task orders issued under the agreement. The initial task orders ran through December 31, 2018, and provided for time-and-materials based pricing with payments to be made to us totaling approximately $4.4 million. In addition, we contributed non-cash in-kind contributions with a value of approximately $2.5 million.
On November 29, 2018, we entered into a second services agreement with X-energy to provide X-energy with (i) technical and resource support to the design and license application development of its nuclear fuel production facility and (ii) non-cash in-kind contributions subject to a cooperative agreement between X-energy and the United States government. The services will be performed pursuant to separate task orders issued under the agreement. The initial task orders run through September 30, 2019 with deliverables to be completed through November 30, 2019, and provide for time-and-materials based pricing with payments to be made to us totaling approximately $4.2 million. In addition, we agreed to provide non-cash in-kind contributions with a value of approximately $2.4 million.
Competition and Foreign Trade
It is estimated that the enrichment industry market is currently about 50 million SWU per year. Our global market share is approximately 3%. Global LEU suppliers in our highly competitive industry compete primarily on the basis of price and secondarily on reliability of supply and customer service. The four largest LEU suppliers comprise an estimated 96% of market share combined:

• | Rosatom, a Russian government entity, which sells LEU through its wholly owned subsidiary TENEX;


• | Urenco, a consortium of companies owned or controlled by the British and Dutch governments and two German utilities;


• | Orano, a company largely owned by the French government that was formerly part of the French government owned company, AREVA; and


• | China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation (“CNEIC”), a company owned by the Chinese government.

The production capacity for Rosatom/TENEX is estimated by the World Nuclear Association (“WNA”) to be approximately 27 million SWU per year. Imports of LEU and other uranium products produced in the Russian Federation are subject to restrictions as described below under —Limitations on Imports of LEU from Russia.
Urenco reported installed capacity at its European and U.S. enrichment facilities of 18.6 million SWU per year at the end of 2018.
Orano’s gas centrifuge enrichment plant in France began commercial operations in 2011 and the plant’s nominal capacity of 7.5 million SWU was reportedly in service at the end of 2016. Orano has reported that it has suspended planned capacity expansions beyond 7.5 million SWU.
CNEIC has emerged as a significant producer primarily focused on supplying domestic requirements in China, but it has begun to supply LEU to international markets in recent years. CNEIC’s commercial SWU production capacity is estimated to be approximately 8 million SWU per year in 2019. 
10

All of our current competitors are owned or controlled, in whole or in part, by foreign governments. These competitors may make business decisions in both domestic and international markets that are influenced by political or economic policy considerations rather than exclusively by commercial considerations.
There are also producers of LEU in Japan and Brazil that primarily serve a portion of their respective domestic markets. 
LEU may also be produced by down-blending government stockpiles of highly-enriched uranium. Governments control the timing and availability of highly-enriched uranium released for this purpose, and the release of this material to the market could impact market conditions. Given the current oversupplied nuclear fuel market, any additional LEU from down-blended highly-enriched uranium released into the market would have a negative effect on prices for LEU.
LEU we supply to foreign customers is exported under the terms of international agreements governing nuclear cooperation between the United States and the country of destination or other entities, such as the European Union or the International Atomic Energy Agency. The LEU supplied to us is subject to the terms of cooperation agreements between the country in which the material is produced and the country of destination or other entities.
Limitations on Imports of LEU from Russia
Imports into the United States of LEU and other uranium products produced in the Russian Federation, including LEU imported under the Russian Supply Agreement, are subject to quotas imposed under legislation enacted into law in September 2008 and under the 1992 Russian Suspension Agreement, as amended in 2008. These quotas limit the amount of Russian LEU that can be imported into the United States for U.S. consumption. At present, the quotas apply through 2020 and, for 2016-2020, are set at an amount equal to approximately 20% of projected annual U.S. consumption of LEU, based on a market report published in 2015 by the WNA.
As an exception to the quotas on imports of LEU for U.S. consumption, both the Russian Suspension Agreement and the September 2008 legislation permit unlimited imports of Russian LEU for use in initial cores for any new U.S. nuclear reactor.
It is possible that the quotas on imports of Russian LEU could change. Both the Russian Suspension Agreement and the September 2008 legislation require the U.S. Department of Commerce (“DOC”) to adjust the quotas in 2016 and 2019 based on changes in projected reactor demand as forecast by the WNA. In 2016, the DOC preliminarily determined that the adjustment would increase the quotas, but this increase was challenged by U.S. uranium mining companies, and, in May 2017, the DOC finally determined to increase the quota in 2018 and to reduce it in 2019 and 2020. However, because contracts approved by the DOC prior to the change in the quotas are not affected by the quota adjustment, this change in the quotas in 2019 and 2020 are not expected to materially affect imports of Russian LEU in those years pursuant to such contracts.
Additionally, as more fully explained below, the quotas on imports of Russian LEU could be extended beyond December 31, 2020, which is the current expiration date of quotas under both the Russian Suspension Agreement and the September 2008 legislation, if, for example, the Russian and U.S. governments were to agree on such an extension. On February 22, 2019, the DOC sent a letter to Rosatom formally opening consultations with Rosatom and TENEX with respect to a possible extension of the Russian Suspension Agreement. We cannot predict the outcome of these negotiations but they could result in an agreement on new quotas for the period after 2020.
11

Aside from the quotas on imports of Russian LEU that will be consumed in the United States, there is a separate quota that applies to deliveries of Russian LEU to foreign customers at U.S. fabrication facilities. This quota generally requires that the LEU be processed and re-exported within a certain period of time although, in 2014, the DOC approved our proposal that Japanese customers with which we have existing contracts be allowed to physically store certain amounts of Russian LEU in the United States pending the restart of nuclear reactors in Japan. 
In October 2017, Louisiana Energy Services (“LES”), a U.S. subsidiary of Urenco, a foreign competitor, requested that the DOC conduct an administrative review of the Russian Suspension Agreement for the period October 2016 through September 2017. By statute, the purpose of an administrative review is to review the current status of, and compliance with the Russian Suspension Agreement during the period of the review. We are not aware of any violation of the Russian Suspension Agreement and in November 2018, the DOC preliminarily determined that there was no evidence of such a violation. However, in filings with the DOC, LES has requested the agency undertake a much broader review of whether the Russian Suspension Agreement continues to prevent the suppression or undercutting of price levels of domestic uranium products. In its November 2018 determination, the DOC stated that it would need additional time to collect all the evidence required to determine whether the Russian Suspension Agreement continues to prevent price suppression or undercutting. The date for the final determination is June 24, 2019.
At the conclusion of its review, the DOC could leave the Russian Suspension Agreement in place, reach an agreement with the Russian Federation that would modify the Russian Suspension Agreement, impose additional or different restrictions on imports of Russian uranium products, including LEU, beyond 2020 or terminate the Russian Suspension Agreement and restart the suspended antidumping investigation. 
Imposition of additional restrictions or the restart of the investigation accompanied by an imposition of duties could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and could make it economically difficult or impossible for us to continue to import Russia LEU or sell the amounts required to be purchased under the Russian Supply Agreement. In that case, we would need to find alternative supplies of LEU to meet our obligations to U.S. customers, and also find alternative markets outside the United States in which to sell the Russian SWU that we are obligated to purchase from TENEX but which we could not import or sell in the United States. Alternatively, if, instead of restarting the investigation, the DOC agrees with the Russian government to modify the Russian Suspension Agreement and extend or impose new restrictions on imports of Russian LEU, our ability to continue to deliver Russian LEU to customers would depend upon whether we could secure an exception under those new restrictions or a share of any quota granted to TENEX.
We are actively participating in the administrative review and seeking to ensure that the Russian Suspension Agreement is implemented in a manner that does not adversely impact our existing contracts, including the Russian Supply Agreement, or our ability to continue to offer a diverse supply to our customers in the United States. The administrative review is expected to conclude in mid-2019.
In October 2018, LES requested DOC to also conduct an administrative review of the Russian Suspension Agreement for the period October 2017 through September 2018. This review will be in addition to the current review. In October 2019 and 2020, LES and other domestic parties will have additional opportunities to request that the DOC conduct administrative reviews. 
Absent an agreement between the DOC and the Russian government to extend the Russian Suspension Agreement, the Russian Suspension Agreement (and the antidumping order that it suspended) will expire at the end of 2020. The quotas under the September 2008 legislation also are scheduled to expire at the end of 2020. As noted above, on February 22, 2019, the DOC sent a letter to Rosatom formally opening consultations with Rosatom and TENEX with respect to a possible extension of the Russian Suspension Agreement. We cannot predict the outcome of these negotiations but they could result in an agreement on new quotas for the period after 2020.

Limitations on Imports of LEU from France
The DOC imposed an antidumping order on imports of French LEU in 2002, that was subject to periodic review to determine if the order should be maintained in effect. In connection with its most recent view of the order, the DOC did not receive any notices that domestic parties intended to participate in the review. Consequently, the order was revoked in the March 2019.
Other Trade Actions
On January 16, 2018, two U.S. mining companies submitted a request to the DOC to investigate the impact of uranium imports on national security under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. In the petition, these companies proposed, as a remedy, that the President (1) impose quotas on imports that will ensure that 25% of the U.S. market is reserved to newly-produced U.S. uranium and (2) adopt a “Buy American” preference for purchases of all forms of uranium by U.S. agencies, including U.S. government corporations, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority. By statute, the investigation should have been completed within 270 days after the investigation is initiated, with up to an additional 90 days granted for Presidential action after the investigation results are reported to the President.
Along with a number of other U.S. and foreign companies that potentially could be affected by the proposed remedy, we have participated vigorously in this Section 232 proceeding. In January 2019, the DOC issued a detailed questionnaire to a number of companies, including Centrus, to obtain information about their sales, imports, production and other matters, for the purposes of preparing a report to the President, including recommendations regarding possible actions to take. The DOC is expected to conclude its investigation in April 2019. 
The outcome of a national security investigation of uranium imports is unknown. Even if the DOC found that imports threatened national security, the President would not be obligated to grant the remedies requested by the mining companies but could choose to grant other remedies or to impose no remedies at all. Nonetheless, if the remedies requested by the mining companies were granted, the remedies could create additional barriers to imports or sales of non-U.S. uranium, including our imports and sales of enriched uranium and its components.
DOE Facilities
We produced LEU through May 2013 at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (“Paducah GDP”) in Paducah, Kentucky which we had leased from DOE. We then repackaged and transferred our existing inventory to offsite licensed locations under agreements with the operators of those facilities. Our prior enrichment operations generated hazardous, low-level radioactive and mixed wastes. The storage, treatment, and disposal of wastes are regulated by federal and state laws. The treatment and disposal of wastes from our prior operations at the Paducah GDP were completed in 2016. Regarding our past operations at the former Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (“Portsmouth GDP”) in Piketon, Ohio, DOE agreed in 2011 to accept ownership of all nuclear material at the site, some of which required processing for waste disposal. We agreed to pay DOE for costs for disposing of our share of such wastes. The treatment and disposal of wastes from our prior operations at the Portsmouth GDP were completed in 2017. 
The Portsmouth and Paducah gaseous diffusion plants were operated by agencies of the U.S. government for approximately 40 years prior to our privatization in 1998. As a result of such operation, there are contamination and other potential environmental liabilities associated with the plants. The USEC Privatization Act and our former leases for the plants provide that DOE remains responsible for the D&D of the gaseous diffusion plants. 
We continue to lease the portion of the DOE facility in Piketon, Ohio, that was formerly used to demonstrate the American Centrifuge technology. We commenced with D&D of the demonstration cascade in the Piketon facility in accordance with U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”) requirements in 2016. We believe the D&D work required under NRC license requirements has been completed. At the conclusion of the Piketon facility lease on June 30, 2019, absent mutual agreement between the Company and DOE regarding other possible uses for the facility, we are obligated to return the facility to DOE in a condition that meets NRC requirements and in the same 
13

condition as the facility was in when it was leased to us (other than due to normal wear and tear). By the conclusion of the lease term, we must remove all Company-owned capital improvements, unless otherwise consented to by DOE, by the conclusion of the lease term.
As discussed above, on January 7, 2019, DOE issued a Notice of Intent to contract with Centrus to deploy a cascade of centrifuges to demonstrate the ability to produce HALEU suitable for a range of military and civilian applications including fueling advanced reactors currently under development. The cascade of centrifuge machines would be deployed at the Piketon facility whereby we would maintain our lease and NRC license for at least the term of the associated contract.
On September 27, 2018, we entered into an agreement with DOE to D&D the K-1600 facility of DOE located at the East Tennessee Technology Park. Under the terms of the agreement, pursuant to a work authorization under our lease with DOE, we will remove and dispose of government owned materials and equipment in order to render the facility non-contaminated and unclassified. The work to be performed is expected to be completed by September 30, 2019. The contract is a cost-plus fixed fee contract totaling approximately $15 million. The contract is incrementally funded and subject to appropriations by the federal government.
