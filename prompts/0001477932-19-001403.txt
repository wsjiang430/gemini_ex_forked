Item 1. Business
 
We are a technology company focused on developing and commercializing products utilizing our proprietary technology platform. We service the medical and recreational cannabis, hemp and CBD segments of the larger e-cigarette and vaporizer markets with our oil vaporizer focused products. At present, we have three principal product lines consisting of the 710 Shark cartridge filling machine, the 710 Captain cartridge capping machine, and our proprietary cartridges. Our customers are primarily businesses operating in jurisdictions that have some form of cannabis legalization. These businesses include medical and recreational dispensaries, large and small-scale processors and growers, and distributors. We expect continued growth as we take measures to invest in our own molds and intellectual property. We utilize a direct sales force, independent sales representatives, a referral network of manufacturers of related equipment, and our website, convectium.com, to sell our principal products.
 
Our flagship product is the 710 Shark vaporizer cartridge filling machine. It is designed to inject oil into various cartridges (glass, plastic and PODS) while also having the capability to fill bottles and other form factors. The 710 Shark is based on a pneumatic system and has a heating mechanism that allows the oil to be injected and processed. It can fill 100 traditional cartridges in less than 30 seconds, saving our customers the valuable time and labor expense of hand filling cartridges - which is currently the industry norm. We estimate that, in most applications, the 710 Shark will have a 60x faster rate than hand filling. The 710 Shark is currently produced in China and the machine is now on its eighth version. 
 
In the second quarter of 2018 we introduced our 710 Captain capping machine. It is designed to affix caps to the cartridges filled by our 710 Shark filling machine and matches the production capacity of the 710 Shark at 100 cartridges in 30 seconds. It is pneumatically operated. The 710 Captain is currently produced in Irvine, California, by a contract manufacturer.
 
A much smaller portion of our business consists of our sales of non-proprietary vaporizer cartridges with core materials ranging from plastic to glass and heating technology from cotton wicks to ceramic and wickless materials. We also offer a selection of batteries to match the cartridges. Batteries range from button-less standard heating to push-button adjustable heating settings. Most of the vaporizer cartridge and battery units can be customized to our customers’ specifications, including adjusting colors, materials, and adding logos and images per the customer’s request. We deliver the vaporizer products unassembled and deliver the hardware directly to customers where the product is then filled and assembled at customer’s place of business by their personnel. We maintain relationships with packaging manufacturers who offer sophisticated labeling and customization capabilities, allow us to add value to our customers’ packaging design processes.
 
We have two distinct distribution platforms for our products, traditional direct sales and online sales. The majority of our sales are direct B2B sales of our principal products, namely the 710 Shark, the 710 Captain and our proprietary cartridges in North America. We generate these sales through our employed sales force, outside independent sales representatives, and our referral network of related equipment manufacturers and resellers. Our primary customers for our principal products are medical and recreational dispensaries, large and small-scale processors and growers, and distributors. We utilize our convectium.com website to support these sales channels and products. 
 
Separately, and at a much smaller scale, we sell non-proprietary cartridge and battery units both B2B and B2C using our BlackoutX.com website with limited support from our inside sales staff. While we have sold these collateral products into 52 different countries, most sales are into North America. We do not intend to devote substantial resources to expand this business over the next twelve months.
 
Our employed sales force consists of seven direct sales representatives and three inside sales representatives. The inside sales representatives are prospecting for leads and pass along larger leads to the outside representatives. We anticipate continued expansion of our sales team throughout North America as the demand for our products continues to expand.
 
Our marketing efforts include attending industry trade shows. In 2018, we participated in fourteen such trade shows which we believe helped generate a significant amount of business and marketing opportunities. We typically have a 10’ x 20’ booth with demo machines and various pens and cartridges that we sell.
 
We also advertise in industry magazines and at other regional events where both B2B and B2C opportunities exist. We plan to expand our marketing efforts to new jurisdictions as they pass medical and recreational cannabis use laws. We also believe we have a large opportunity in the Canadian marketplace which plans to be recreationally legal for oils sometime in 2019.
 
We also have entered into referral and reseller agreements to expand our market footprint across North America. Our partners include extraction companies, wholesalers, distributors and individuals with significant industry contacts. We intend to expand the number of referral and reseller partners. These agreements typically provide a commission or referral fee to the source upon a completed sale.

Corporate History and Background
 
We were initially incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 21, 1989, under the name Fulton Ventures, Inc. On September 19, 2002, we changed our name to Asia Premium Television Group, Inc. to more accurately reflect our business at the time. Effective November 16, 2009, we changed our name to China Grand Resorts, Inc. to more accurately reflect its new business efforts. Commencing in 2002, we acquired and sold a series of subsidiary entities that were incorporated in various foreign jurisdictions, including the People’s Republic of China, or PRC, Macau, Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands. Through 2009, these subsidiaries engaged in a variety of businesses, including, principally, marketing, brand management, advertising, media planning, public relations and direct marketing services to clients in the PRC.
 
The Company discontinued filing periodic reports under the Exchange Act, after it filed a quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2014 (the “June 2014 10-Q”) on August 14, 2014. As reported in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 20, 2013 (the last periodic report filed under the Exchange Act with which the Company furnished audited financial statements) and the June 2014 10-Q, the Company was engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the provision of mobile phone based services in the PRC through Sun New Media Transaction Services Ltd., a Hong Kong corporation, and real estate investment in the PRC through Key Proper Holdings Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation.
 
Since the filing of the June 2014 10-Q, current management is not aware of any contact between the Company and incumbent management as of the filing of the June 2014 10-Q, which we refer to as “former management,” nor does current management have any knowledge or information relating to the business operations conducted by the Company or its subsidiaries as of that date, other than as reported in the periodic reports it filed with the SEC. Current management does not have in its possession any records of the Company prior to Mr. Glass taking operational control of the Company in April 2016, other than documents filed with or furnished to the SEC.
 
On April 4, 2016, Bryan Glass was appointed to serve as the custodian of the Company pursuant to an order of the District Court of Clark County Nevada, during the course of which Mr. Glass was issued 30 million shares of our common stock and served as our sole officer and director. 
 
On September 14, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization that resulted in the acquisition of the business of Jacksam, which we now operate as our wholly-owned subsidiary. Jacksam commenced operations as a Delaware corporation in August 2013 under the name Jacksam Corporation. Prior to the Merger, we were a dormant company without any active operations and we were a “shell company” as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2. Subsequently, as reported on our Form 10-Q filed November 5, 2018, we merged our wholly owned operating subsidiary into the parent in a transaction filed October 24, 2018 and effective November 5, 2018, and in connection with that transaction amended our articles of incorporation to change our name from China Grand Resorts, Inc. to Jacksam Corporation (the “Short Form Merger”).
 
Since the Merger, we have continued to operate the business of Jacksam Corporation, described herein, as our sole business.
 
Immediately prior to the Merger, we had 33,272,311 shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding and no shares of preferred stock or any securities convertible into any class of our capital stock issued and outstanding. Per the Merger, each of the 149,870 shares of the pre-Merger Jacksam’s Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger was converted into shares of our Common Stock at a ratio of 1:300.26023 for a total of 45,000,000 shares of our Common Stock. Additionally, (i) the rights to purchase common stock of Jacksam as contained in those certain Convertible Debentures of Jacksam (the “2017 Debentures”) originally issued between November 2017 and January 2018 in total principal amount of $1,718,500 and issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger were converted into a corresponding right to purchase shares of our Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.20 per share, or 8,592,500 shares in total; (ii) the rights to purchase common stock of Jacksam as contained in those certain Convertible Notes of Jacksam (the “2018 Notes”) originally issued in 2018 in total principal amount of $1,500,000 and issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger were converted into a corresponding right to purchase shares of our Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.73 per share, or 2,062,160 shares in total; and (iii) the warrant held by Altar Rock Capital (the “Altar Rock Warrant”) to purchase 16,652 shares of common stock of Jacksam was converted into the right to purchase 5,000,000 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.001 per share for a total exercise price of $5,000.00. As a result, an aggregate of 60,654,660 shares of our Common Stock, including rights pursuant to the 2017 Debentures, the 2018 Notes, and the Altar Rock Warrant to acquire our Common Stock, were issued to the pre-Merger holders of Jacksam’s capital stock and convertible securities; provided, however, that the number of shares of our Common Stock issuable to any holder of a 2017 Debenture and to the holder of the Altar Rock Warrant may not, in any instance, exceed 4.99% of our then issued and outstanding Common Stock. Finally, 30 million shares of our Common Stock, purchased by Jacksam from Bryan Glass on September 14, 2018 for total consideration of $340,000, our former controlling shareholder, officer and director, were returned to treasury by Jacksam and cancelled.

Following the Merger and the related share issuances and cancellations, we had a total of 48,272,311 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, plus rights to acquire an additional 15,654,660 shares of our common stock outstanding, for a total potential share count of 63,926,971 shares of our common stock in the event that all of the 2017 Debentures, the 2018 Notes and the Altar Rock Warrants were to be converted into our common stock.
 
The 2017 Debentures and the associated Registration Rights Agreement required us to file a registration statement covering the resale of the 8,592,500 shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the 2017 Debentures. The terms of the Altar Rock warrant similarly require us to file a registration statement covering the 5,000,000 shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of the Altar Rock Warrant.
 
In prior documents, such as the 8-K and S-1/A, the shares related to the 2018 convertible notes were calculated incorrectly. The correct number of shares related to the 2018 notes are 2,062,160 as stated above.

Our Business Strategy
 
Our overall goal is to become a leading technology company in that segment of the vaporizer filling, capping and systems business that focuses on serving the cannabis, hemp and CBD industries. We are focused on developing and commercializing products utilizing our proprietary filling, capping and vaporizer systems. 
 
Our immediate term goals are: 
 

· | Increase awareness, efficiency and demand for the 710 Shark and the 710 Captain machines. We intend to continue to develop increasing efficient and fast iterations of our Shark filling machine and our Captain capping machine. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Create new products. We plan to create more proprietary vaporization cartridges that we can sell to our customers as a closed proprietary system. 
· | Increase our domestic and international presence. As more states and countries approve legalized cannabis use, we plan on hiring additional sales personnel where appropriate to take advantage of new markets. We also plan to continue to grow our distributor and affiliate networks to meet expected additional demand for our products.

Existing or Probable Governmental Regulation
 
Because cannabis remains illegal under US federal law and our products are primarily purchased by providers of cannabis to consumers in those states that have legalized medical or recreational cannabis, a change in US federal enforcement priorities could adversely affect our customers and our business. 
 
Our products and business are not otherwise subject to material governmental regulation other than those laws and regulations of general application.
 
Market and Competition

The automated cartridge filling and packaging industry in the cannabis, hemp and CBD marketplace is relatively nascent. We believe that we are the largest manufacturer of cannabis focused filling machines, with an approximately 50% market share by units sold. Most cartridge filling operations are still done by hand at present, with a throughput rate of approximately 75 per hour. Hand-filling remains our largest competitor.
 
The competition in the cannabis specific filling machine market consists of a few players that are focused on regional markets and small growers. Our most direct competitors include Thompson-Duke, Transpring, and Cooljarz. Thompson-Duke is based in Oregon. Its system will fill approximately 16-20 cartridges per minute. Transpring is based in China. Its system will fill approximately 30 cartridges per minute. Cooljarz is based in California. Its system will fill approximately 12 cartridges per minute.
 
Additionally, there are a few manufacturers that manufacture and distribute directly from China, none of which appear to have gained significant market share. 
 
Our most substantial competitive threat would be from the large tobacco e-cigarette manufacturers and the large medical equipment manufacturers, should either decide to enter the automated cartridge filling and packaging industry for cannabis, hemp and CBD. Many of these companies possess substantially greater manufacturing, sales, marketing, research and development, and financial resources. To date, however, none have entered the market. Nor are we aware of any with immediate plans to do so. We believe that failure is due to the fact that federal and state laws are in the process of changing significantly. Were any large tobacco e-cigarette manufacturer or medical equipment manufacturer to enter the market, our business and prospects would be adversely affected.

Intellectual Property Rights
 
We currently have one Certificate of Design Patent from the Peoples Republic of China for the 710 Shark filling machine, number ZL201630571863.4 issued May 31, 2017, which is valid for ten years. We have not filed for any other patents but continue to examine whether, and where, it may be advantageous for us to do so. We intend to seek US patents for certain aspects of our 710 Shark and our 710 Captain machines as well as certain of our proprietary cartridges. 
 
In addition, we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, trademarks, copyright protection, and continuing technological opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We have periodically monitored and continue to monitor the activities of our competitors and other third parties with respect to their use of intellectual property. We require our employees, consultants, and third-party collaborators to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements upon commencing employment or consulting relationships with us.
 
Research and Development
 
Our research and development group consists of our founder and director, Daniel Davis, and three employed engineers. These individuals also work with our manufacturers to design new products. We are currently in the process of developing an updated 710 Shark filling machine, an updated 710 Captain capping machine and new proprietary vaporizers and cartridges.
Employees
 
Presently, we have 18 full-time employees. Eleven employees are engaged in marketing, sales and business development, three employees, plus our founder, are engaged in research and development and engineering, two are engaged in project management and manufacturing, one is engaged in shipping and logistics management, and three employees are engaged in general management and administration. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
