Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing small molecule therapeutics targeting fundamental biological pathways of cancers. We are developing a focused pipeline of potentially best-in-class oncology candidates. Our product candidates are:
•Azenosertib (ZN-c3), a potentially first-in-class Wee1 inhibitor for advanced solid tumors and hematological malignancies;
•ZN-d5, a B-cell lymphoma 2, or BCL-2, inhibitor for hematological malignancies and related disorders; and 
•A heterobifunctional degrader of BCL-xL, a member of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins, for solid tumors and hematological malignancies. 
We are currently evaluating azenosertib and ZN-d5 in multiple ongoing clinical trials and conducting studies to enable an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for our BCL-xL product candidate. We also continue to use our extensive drug discovery experience and capabilities across cancer biology and medicinal chemistry, which we refer to as our Integrated Discovery Engine, to advance our ongoing research on protein degraders of undisclosed targets. We believe our product candidates are differentiated from current programs targeting similar pathways and, if approved, have the potential to significantly impact clinical outcomes of patients with cancer.
Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company. Our strategy includes the following key components:
•Rapidly advance the clinical development of our potentially best-in-class and first-in-class Wee1 inhibitor, azenosertib, toward regulatory approval. To date, our lead product candidate, azenosertib, has demonstrated a favorable safety profile and monotherapy anti-tumor activity across multiple tumor types in clinical trials. We have established a three-pronged clinical development plan for azenosertib: investigation as a monotherapy; in combination with chemotherapy and DNA damaging agents; and in combination with molecularly targeted agents. We are currently advancing multiple clinical trials of azenosertib in the following indications: recurrent or persistent uterine serous carcinoma, or USC; solid tumors; Cyclin E1 driven high-grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer, collectively HGSOC; platinum-resistant ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer; relapsed or refractory, or R/R, osteosarcoma; and BRAF V600E mutant metastatic colorectal cancer, or mCRC. In addition, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, or Dana Farber, is sponsoring a clinical trial of azenosertib in combination with chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer. We believe our clinical trials investigating azenosertib as a monotherapy in USC and Cyclin E1 driven HGSOC have the potential to generate data that would support a registration.
•Optimize the dose of azenosertib. Our clinical development program for azenosertib includes activities to optimize dose and dosing schedule in order to enhance exposure, tolerability and clinical activity in both the monotherapy and combination settings. We plan to declare a monotherapy recommended Phase 2 dose, or RP2D, and provide an update on dose optimization activities, program timelines and potential paths to registration, in the first half of 2023. We believe our dose optimization work will allow us to benefit the broadest range of cancer patients and maximize value for all of our stakeholders.
•Execute our Cyclin E1 patient enrichment strategy for azenosertib. Cyclin E1 acts at the G1-S checkpoint of the cell cycle and high Cyclin E1 protein expression drives premature entry into S-phase resulting in replicative stress and significantly increasing sensitivity to azenosertib. We have generated preclinical data that showed that high Cyclin E1 protein expression sensitized cancer cells to the anti-tumor effects of azenosertib. In addition, retrospective clinical data suggested that Cyclin E1 protein levels may be associated with clinical benefit from Wee1 inhibition. High Cyclin E1 protein expression and/or CCNE1 gene amplification in HGSOC is the focus of our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial examining patient enrichment strategies for azenosertib. We plan to present our preclinical rationale for our Cyclin E1 patient enrichment strategy in the first half of 2023. In addition, we plan to disclose results from our Phase 1b clinical trial of azenosertib in combination with chemotherapy in platinum-resistant ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer, including Cyclin E1 translational data, in the second half of 2023. 
•Focus the clinical development of our potentially best-in-class BCL-2 inhibitor. Our BCL-2 inhibitor, ZN-d5, was designed to have best-in-class potency, selectivity and pharmacokinetic, or PK, properties. We are focusing our clinical development of ZN-d5 on advancing our clinical trial investigating ZN-d5 as a monotherapy in R/R light chain amyloidosis, or AL amyloidosis, and our clinical trial investigating ZN-d5 in combination with azenosertib in R/R acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. We plan to announce interim data from our R/R AL amyloidosis trial and preliminary data from our R/R AML trial in the second half of 2023. We are also engaged in dose optimization activities for ZN-d5 and expect to declare a monotherapy RP2D for our clinical trial in R/R AL amyloidosis in the second half of 2023.
•Leverage our deep expertise and capabilities across cancer biology and medicinal chemistry to advance our preclinical programs. In November 2022, we declared a development candidate for our BCL-xL protein degrader program, and we are working to advance the program through IND-enabling studies. We are also advancing our research on protein degraders of undisclosed targets utilizing our Integrated Discovery Engine. 
•Collaborate under our existing strategic partnerships and evaluate additional strategic opportunities to maximize the value of our pipeline. We have development collaborations with Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline plc, or GSK, and Dana Farber for azenosertib. We will selectively evaluate additional strategic collaborations for our product candidates and research programs with partners whose assets and capabilities complement our own.
Our Pipeline

We are developing a focused pipeline of oncology product candidates with the potential to address significant unmet medical need for cancer patients. Two of our product candidates are currently in multiple ongoing clinical trials: azenosertib, an inhibitor of Wee1, a protein tyrosine kinase, and ZN-d5, a selective inhibitor of BCL-2. To date, azenosertib has been well tolerated and has demonstrated monotherapy anti-tumor activity across multiple tumor types in clinical trials. In addition, ZN-d5 has been well tolerated in clinical trials to date. We have also declared a development candidate for our BCL-xL degrader program, for which we are conducting IND-enabling studies.
We currently exclusively in-license worldwide development and commercialization rights to azenosertib, ZN-d5, and our BCL-xL product candidate. We out-licensed azenosertib and ZN-d5 development and commercialization rights in select Asian countries, including China, to our joint venture, Zentera Therapeutics, or Zentera. As of December 31, 2022, we held a 40.3% equity interest in Zentera. For more information about our joint venture with Zentera, see Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—License Agreements and Strategic Collaborations" and Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The following table summarizes our product candidate pipeline.
Our Development Programs
Azenosertib (Wee1 Inhibitor)
Overview
Azenosertib is a potentially best-in-class and first-in-class oral, small molecule Wee1 inhibitor. As illustrated in the figure below, the inhibition of Wee1, a DNA damage response kinase, drives cancer cells into mitosis without being able to repair damaged DNA, resulting in cell death and thereby preventing tumor growth and potentially causing tumor regression. Currently, there are no Wee1 inhibitors approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. We have designed azenosertib to have advantages over other investigational therapies targeting Wee1, including superior selectivity and PK properties. Azenosertib is currently being evaluated in the clinic for advanced solid tumors and hematological malignancies in the following three therapeutic settings of high unmet medical need: 
•as a monotherapy, 
•in combination with traditional chemotherapy and DNA damaging agents, and 
•in combination with molecularly targeted agents.
We believe azenosertib has the potential to benefit a broad range of cancer patients due to the following: 
•Demonstrated monotherapy anti-tumor activity across tumor types in clinical trials and preclinical studies. In clinical trials to date, azenosertib has demonstrated monotherapy anti-tumor activity across multiple tumor types, including USC, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. In addition, in preclinical studies, azenosertib showed anti-tumor activity across a number of hematological and solid tumor cell lines, as well as tumor growth inhibition, DNA damage and apoptosis. Anti-tumor activity was observed in both continuous and intermittent dosing in clinical trials and preclinical studies of azenosertib.
•Well tolerated in clinical trials. In clinical trials to date, azenosertib was observed to be well tolerated across varying dosage levels, with over 200 patients having been administered azenosertib to date. 
•Potency, selectivity and solubility. In our in vitro preclinical studies, we observed data indicating azenosertib’s potential potency in inhibiting tumor growth and inducing apoptosis through DNA damage. Preclinical studies also showed that azenosertib has high selectivity for Wee1. In our preclinical studies, azenosertib produced favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, or ADME, results. 
•PK properties. In our clinical studies, we observed that an increase in dose / drug exposure directly related to Wee1 target engagement. In our preclinical studies, azenosertib showed PK properties that resulted in high drug exposure in animal models. We believe this level of drug exposure may contribute to the observed sustained and lengthy tumor growth inhibition. In addition, we observed that azenosertib had favorable drug accumulation in tumors in preclinical studies. 
Two key components of our azenosertib clinical development strategy are our dose optimization activities and our pursuit of Cyclin E1 as a patient enrichment strategy.
Dose Optimization
To date, azenosertib has demonstrated a favorable safety profile and monotherapy anti-tumor activity when administered on a continuous daily dosing schedule. Preclinical data show that higher doses delivered on an intermittent schedule have the potential to lead to higher PK exposures and a more favorable therapeutic index. For example, we assessed the efficacy and tolerability of azenosertib in in vitro preclinical studies across a variety of solid tumor cell lines, The figure 
below shows intermittent dosing results from an ovarian cancer model, OVCAR3. We observed that azenosertib’s tolerability was maintained while its potency in inhibiting tumor growth and inducing DNA damage and apoptosis increased with intermittent dosing. 
Cyclin E1 Biomarker Strategy
As shown in the diagram below, high Cyclin E1 protein expression acts at the G1-S checkpoint by driving premature entry into S-phase resulting in replicative stress and significantly increasing sensitivity to azenosertib.
Historical, published clinical data showed that CCNE1 gene amplification was associated with poor prognosis and chemotherapy response across tumor types including in triple negative breast cancer and carboplatin-treated ovarian cancer models. We have also generated preclinical data that showed that high Cyclin E1 protein expression sensitized cancer cells to the anti-tumor effects of azenosertib as well as preliminary retrospective clinical data that suggested that high Cyclin E1 protein levels may be associated with clinical benefit from azenosertib. High Cyclin E1 protein expression and/or CCNE1 gene amplification in HGSOC is the focus of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial examining enrichment strategies for azenosertib described below. We believe this trial has the potential to allow us to demonstrate efficacy in an enriched patient population that has shown evidence of clinical sensitivity to Wee1 inhibition.
Development Program
Monotherapy - Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Recurrent or Persistent Uterine Serous Carcinoma (USC) (ZN-c3-004)
Azenosertib is currently being evaluated as a monotherapy in a Phase 2 clinical trial in adult women with USC. As of a September 14, 2022 data cutoff, a total of 43 patients were enrolled and dosed. Azenosertib was well tolerated. The most common treatment related adverse events, or AEs, were nausea (60.5% all grades/9.3% grade 3 or higher), fatigue (46.5% all grades/9.3% grade 3 or higher), diarrhea (37.2% all grades/7.0% grade 3 or higher) and vomiting (32.6% all grades/7.0% grade 3 or higher). We anticipate declaring an azenosertib monotherapy RP2D in the first half of 2023, and we plan to update the timeline of this USC study thereafter. The FDA granted Fast Track designation in November 2021 to azenosertib in patients with advanced or metastatic USC who have received at least one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen for management of advanced or metastatic disease. We believe that the study design in this patient population has the potential to support registration in the United States.
USC is an aggressive form of endometrial cancer that accounts for approximately 10-15% of all endometrial cancers. In a recent study, the median 5-year survival for Stage III or IV USC was approximately 26.2%. USC is responsible for approximately 40-50% of endometrial cancer deaths. The current standards of care for USC are platinum based chemotherapy (first line) and pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib (second line). We believe there is a high unmet need for a therapeutic option in later line USC patients after prior platinum-based chemotherapy and pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib treatment. USC is characterized by TP53 mutations, often concomitantly with oncogenic mutations or amplifications that can increase replication stress. USC may therefore be uniquely sensitive to further interference of cell cycle regulation by Wee1 inhibition.
Monotherapy - Phase 1 Dose Optimization Clinical Trial in Solid Tumors (ZN-c3-001)
We are currently evaluating azenosertib as a monotherapy in a Phase 1 dose optimization clinical trial for the treatment of solid tumors. We announced preliminary efficacy data from this trial with a data cutoff of May 15, 2021 from 34 patients, where we showed five confirmed partial responses, or cPRs, to azenosertib in monotherapy across several tumor types, including ovarian cancer (-69% cPR), colorectal cancer (-51% cPR), NSCLC (-49% cPR), and USC (-49% cPR) and (-43% cPR). We announced preliminary safety data from this trial at the 2022 American Association of Cancer Research, or AACR, Annual Meeting in April 2022. As of a January 21, 2022 data cutoff, there were 32 patients evaluated for safety and azenosertib was well tolerated. The most common treatment related AEs were nausea (71.9% all grades/3.1% grade 3 or higher), fatigue (53.1% all grades/18.8% grade 3 or higher), diarrhea (46.9% all grades/6.3% grade 3 or higher) and vomiting (46.9% all grades/0% grade 3 or higher). 
We also announced preliminary efficacy data from the Phase 1 monotherapy expansion cohort in USC from this trial at the 2022 AACR Annual Meeting. As of a January 21, 2022 data cutoff, there were 11 evaluable patients in the USC cohort, with 27.3% demonstrating an objective response rate, or ORR, and 90.9% demonstrating a disease control rate, or DCR. 
Monotherapy - Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Cyclin E1 Driven High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer (HGSOC) (ZN-c3-005)
We are evaluating azenosertib as a monotherapy in a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with Cyclin E1 driven HGSOC. Our Cyclin E1 enrichment strategy is supported by preclinical data that showed that high Cyclin E1 protein expression sensitized cancer cells to the anti-tumor effects of azenosertib as well as preliminary retrospective clinical data that Cyclin E1 protein levels may be associated with clinical benefit from Wee1 inhibition.
HGSOC is a form of ovarian cancer that accounts for approximately 75% of all ovarian cancers. The “high-grade” in "high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas" refers to ovarian carcinomas that are classified as grade 3. “Serous” means that the tumor arose from the serous membrane, in the epithelial layer in the abdominopelvic cavity. Patients with HGSOC often respond well to treatment, and can experience remission; however, it is common for HGSOC patients to recur over a period of time, with the majority of recurrences occurring within three years. Outcomes for patients with platinum-resistant HGSOC are poor, with median overall survival reported at less than 12 months.
Combination - Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of Azenosertib and PARPi in Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer (ZN-c3-006)
We are evaluating azenosertib in combination with GSK's PARP inhibitor, niraparib (ZEJULA®), in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients who have failed PARP inhibitor, or PARPi, maintenance treatment as part of a clinical collaboration with GSK. This study is currently enrolling two cohorts — one with concurrent dosing of the two drugs, and one with azenosertib and niraparib administered on a dose escalating, alternating schedule of one week of azenosertib followed by one week of niraparib. This clinical study is supported by preclinical data that showed that combining azenosertib and niraparib resulted in synergistic cell killing in ovarian in vivo models.
Ovarian cancer is a common gynecologic malignancy and common cause of gynecologic cancer death. Worldwide, over 295,000 women were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2018 and nearly 185,000 died from this disease. Despite initial therapy with cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, the disease will relapse in most patients. Of those diagnosed with stage III or IV ovarian cancer, more than 70% will have a recurrence of their disease within the first five years. 
There is an increasing population of patients who develop acquired PARPi resistance. Multiple potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to platinum-based chemotherapies and PARPi have been described in literature, although few have been identified in clinical samples. A key mechanism of clinical resistance is the acquisition of reversion mutations, which are somatic base substitutions or insertions/deletions, or indels, that are typically close to the primary protein-truncating mutation and restore the open reading frame, or ORF, of the gene and functional protein, switching the neoplastic cell from homologous recombination repair, or HRR, deficient to proficient. Tumor cells with one or more mutations in the homologous recombination pathway are vulnerable to the inhibition of the DNA damage repair mechanism mediated by PARP. However, despite good initial response rates of PARPi therapy with significant increases of both progression free survival, or PFS, and overall survival, or OS, most cancers eventually develop resistance. The combination of DNA damage response inhibitors, such as Wee1 and PARP inhibitors may be a promising approach for patients with advanced ovarian cancer with disease progression following PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy.
Combination - Phase 1b Clinical Trial of Azenosertib and Chemotherapy in Platinum-Resistant Ovarian, Peritoneal or Fallopian Tube Cancer (ZN-c3-002)
Azenosertib is currently being evaluated in combination with each of paclitaxel, carboplatin, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) and gemcitabine in four separate cohorts in a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. We provided a preliminary efficacy and safety update at the 2022 AACR Annual Meeting in April 2022, highlighting that azenosertib in combination with chemotherapy demonstrated strong anti-tumor activity 
in a heavily pretreated population and was well tolerated. As of the January 28, 2022 data cutoff, there were 43 evaluable patients for efficacy, with an ORR of 30.2% across all evaluable chemotherapy cohorts (paclitaxel, carboplatin and PLD). In the paclitaxel cohort, there were 8 evaluable patients and an ORR of 62.5%; in the carboplatin cohort, there were 11 evaluable patients and an ORR of 45.5%; and in the PLD cohort, there were 24 evaluable patients and an ORR of 12.5%. As of the January 28, 2022 data cutoff, there were 56 evaluable patients for safety. The most common treatment related AEs were nausea (48.2% all grades/5.4% grade 3 or higher), neutropenia (41.1% all grades/32.1% grade 3 or higher), thrombocytopenia (37.5% all grades/17.9% grade 3 or higher), vomiting (30.4% all grades/7.1% grade 3 or higher) and anemia (26.8 all grades/7.1% grade 3 or higher). 
Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most lethal of all female genital tract cancers. Platinum chemotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment for epithelial ovarian cancer, typically combined with paclitaxel. Platinum resistance, defined as relapse within six months following completion of platinum chemotherapy, occurs in 20–30% of cases. The sensitivity of ovarian cancers to platinum chemotherapy is in part due to a high prevalence of aberrations in the DNA repair pathway of homologous recombination. 
Combination - Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of Azenosertib and Chemotherapy in Relapsed or Refractory Osteosarcoma (ZN-c3-003)
Azenosertib is currently being evaluated in combination with gemcitabine, in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in adult and pediatric patients with R/R osteosarcoma. We reported initial results from this trial at the 2022 Connective Tissue Oncology Society, or CTOS, Annual Meeting in November 2022. As of a October 24, 2022 data cutoff, there were 12 patients evaluable for efficacy, with approximately 33% of patients demonstrating event-free survival, or EFS, at 18 weeks (compared to approximately 12% at 18 weeks for this indication historically). As of the October 24, 2022 data cutoff, there were 17 patients evaluable for safety. Azenosertib demonstrated a manageable safety profile with 82.4% experiencing treatment related AEs of which 52.9% were grade 3 or higher. The most common treatment related AEs were platelet count decreased/thrombocytopenia (47.1% all grades/35.3% grade 3 or higher), fatigue (29.4% all grades/5.9% grade 3 or higher), nausea (29.4% all grades/0% grade 3 or higher) and rash (29.4% all grades/5.9% grade 3 or higher). We received orphan drug designation and rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA for azenosertib in osteosarcoma.
Osteosarcoma is the primary malignant bone tumor that most commonly affects children, adolescents, and young adults. The current management strategy for newly diagnosed osteosarcoma includes neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical removal of the primary tumor along with all clinically evident metastatic disease, plus the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. Five-year survival rates in the US between 2010-2016 were 77% (localized), 65% (regional), 26% (distant) and 60% (overall). The standard of care for localized disease is neoadjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by primary resection and adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy; recurrent or metastatic osteosarcomas are usually resistant to standard of care, and treatment options for refractory osteosarcomas are extremely limited. The Wee1 kinase is often upregulated in osteosarcoma, preserving the G2-M checkpoint and allowing tumor growth and metastases, making Wee1 inhibition a potential therapeutic avenue in the treatment of osteosarcoma. 
Combination - Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of Azenosertib with Encorafenib and Cetuximab (BEACON Regimen) in BRAF V600E Mutant Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC) (ZN-c3-016)
We are collaborating with Pfizer to evaluate azenosertib in combination with encorafenib and cetuximab, an FDA-approved standard of care known as the BEACON regimen, in patients with BRAF V600E mutant mCRC in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. In preclinical studies, Wee1 inhibition has shown synergy with many targeted agents in mutationally driven cancers, and the addition of azenosertib to the BEACON regimen enhanced anti-tumor activity in a cell-line-derived xenograft model. We initiated enrollment in this clinical trial in the first quarter of 2023.
Mutations in BRAF are recurrently detected in human cancer, including melanoma, colorectal, thyroid, NSCLC, and hairy cell leukemia. BRAF encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that is part of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. The majority of mutations in BRAF result in V600E substitution, and these patients generally have a poor prognosis. A recent study of the BEACON regimen evaluated the safety and efficacy of the encorafenib + cetuximab doublet. The findings showed that the confirmed ORR was 19.5% (95% confidence interval, or CI, 14.5% to 25.4%) and 1.8% (95% CI, 0.5% to 4.6%) for control. Median PFS was 4.3 months (95% CI, 4.1 to 5.4). Despite the approval of encorafenib and cetuximab in previously treated BRAF V600E mutant mCRC, treatment options for patients with second and third line disease remains a high unmet medical need. 
Combination - Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of Azenosertib and Chemotherapy in Pancreatic Cancer
We have also agreed to support the Dana Farber-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating azenosertib and chemotherapy, gemcitabine, in platinum-resistant pancreatic cancer patients.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, or PDA, is a highly lethal malignancy with a recently reported 5-year survival rate of 7%. Major reasons for this poor prognosis include the following: (i) late diagnosis with about two-thirds of patients presenting locally advanced or metastatic disease, for which curative surgery is not available; (ii) aggressive clinical behavior with rapid progression through local and distant metastases; and (iii) intrinsic resistance to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
ZN-d5 (BCL-2 Inhibitor)
Overview
ZN-d5 is a potentially best-in-class selective, oral small molecule inhibitor of BCL-2. BCL-2 is a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of cell death, known as apoptosis. The overexpression of BCL-2 is frequently detected in numerous cancer types, which prevents apoptosis of cancer cells. Utilizing our medicinal chemistry expertise, we have designed ZN-d5 to have best-in-class potency, selectivity and PK properties. ZN-d5 is currently being evaluated in the clinic in patients with hematological malignancies in both the monotherapy and combination settings.
We believe ZN-d5 has the potential to benefit cancer patients due to the following:
•Demonstrated activity in clinical data and preclinical models. Preliminary efficacy data from our clinical trials has demonstrated that ZN-d5 is clinically active. In addition, our preclinical models demonstrated that ZN-d5 was observed to be potent in cell lines and xenograft models across a variety of hematological malignancies.
•Well tolerated in clinical trials and preclinical studies. In clinical trials to date, ZN-d5 has been well tolerated. In addition, in our animal toxicity studies, the safety profile of ZN-d5 showed that it was well tolerated across various dosage levels.
•Selectivity. In our preclinical in vitro studies, ZN-d5 showed more than 10 times greater selectivity for BCL-2 than BCL-xL. The inhibition of BCL-xL is a known cause of thrombocytopenia, a commonly reported toxicity in patients treated with venetoclax (VENCLEXTA®). We believe ZN-d5's greater selectivity for BCL-2 over BCL-xL, observed in preclinical studies, may support the use of ZN-d5 in combination with other drugs whose safety profiles, when used as monotherapies or in combination with other anti-neoplastic molecules, are associated with a high rate of thrombocytopenia.
Role of BCL-2 in Hematological Cancers
The BCL-2 family of protein is most notable for its critical role in the regulation of apoptosis at the mitochondrion. Based upon their functions, BCL-2 family proteins are classified into pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members. The anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins include BCL-2, B-cell lymphoma extra-large, or BCL-xL, BCL2L2L, or BCL-w, myeloid cell leukemia-1, or MCL-1, and BCL-2 related protein Al. 
The overexpression of BCL-2 and/or BCL-xL proteins is frequently detected in many different types of cancers, including chronic lymphatic leukemia, or CLL, , small lymphocytic lymphoma, or SLL, AML, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL (including follicular lymphoma, or FL, mantle-cell lymphoma, or MCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL), Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, multiple myeloma, or MM, and small cell lung cancer, or SCLC. These overexpressed proteins prevent apoptosis of cancer cells. We believe the use of small molecule inhibitors to block the protein-protein interactions of BCL-2 and/or BCL-xL with their pro-apoptotic partners has the potential to restore the normal apoptosis process in cancer cells. This therapeutic strategy has been validated in clinical trials and through the FDA's approval of venetoclax (VENCLEXTA®). 
There have been many attempts to develop a new class of anticancer therapies that target BCL-2 and/or BCL-xL proteins. The intracellular localization of the BCL-2 family proteins on the mitochondrial membrane prevents the use of antibodies and other large molecules to target these anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. The large surface area involved in BCL-2 protein-protein interactions, or PPIs, also makes BCL-2 family proteins difficult targets for small molecule drugs. Currently, venetoclax (VENCLEXTA®) is the only FDA-approved BCL-2 inhibitor and, to our knowledge, there are only a small number of additional agents in active clinical development.
Development Program
ZN-d5 is being evaluated in the following monotherapy and combination clinical trials:
Monotherapy - Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial in Relapsed or Refractory Light Chain Amyloidosis (R/R AL Amyloidosis) (ZN-d5-003)
ZN-d5 is being evaluated as a monotherapy in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in R/R AL amyloidosis. BCL-2 inhibition has demonstrated clinical activity in R/R AL amyloidosis; however, there are currently no FDA-approved BCL-2 inhibitors for the treatment of R/R AL amyloidosis. This Phase 1/2 study in patients with R/R AL amyloidosis consists of a dose escalation phase to establish the monotherapy RP2D in this setting, and an expansion phase to further assess the safety and efficacy of ZN-d5 in this population. The study is expected to enroll up to approximately 140 patients. 
R/R AL amyloidosis is a plasma cell disorder in which a non-malignant clonal population of plasma cells secrete high levels of a misfolding immunoglobulin light chain can become deposited in tissues, causing widespread organ damage. Though not a malignancy, R/R AL amyloidosis is a difficult and progressive disease that is commonly treated with agents active against multiple myeloma, a malignancy of plasma cells, which can include stem cell transplant and, more commonly, combinations of chemotherapy, proteosome inhibitors, immunomodulating agents, dexamethasone, and monoclonal antibodies that target plasma cells. R/ R AL amyloidosis is a rare disease that is often progressive despite multiple lines of therapy, and we believe represents an unmet medical need. R/R AL amyloidosis has an estimated worldwide prevalence of 75,000 patients and there are approximately 4,000 new cases in the United States each year. Since BCL-2 inhibition has been associated with clinical activity in multiple myeloma, agents inhibiting BCL-2 could be effective therapies for R/R AL amyloidosis. 
Monotherapy - Phase 1 Clinical Trial in Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) (ZN-d5-001) 
We are evaluating ZN-d5 as a monotherapy in a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial in patients with NHL. As of the database cutoff date of November 3, 2021, 23 patients with NHL were evaluable for safety. At our R&D Day in December 2021, we reported preliminary interim data from the NHL patients in this study. As of the November 3, 2021 database cutoff date, ZN-d5 was well tolerated, with 73.9% of the NHL patients having experienced AEs (30.4% grade 3 or higher), not all of which were related ZN-d5. Anemia (21.7% all grades/8.7% grade 3 or higher), diarrhea (13.0% all grades/4.3% grade 3 or higher), and nausea and vomiting (8.7% each all grades/0% grade 3 or higher) comprise the most commonly experienced AEs. Investigator-reported responses using the Lugano 2014 classification among 11 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma included a complete response, an unconfirmed PR, and two subjects with stable disease, as of the database cutoff date of November 3, 2021. 
NHL is a group of malignant neoplasms originating in lymphoid tissue, mainly lymph nodes. The vast majority of NHL are of B-cell origin, of which the most common subtypes are diffuse large B‑cell lymphoma (about 30%) and follicular lymphoma (about 20%) account for approximately 50% and 30% respectively. Survival rates vary depending on the cancer’s stage, subtype and response to initial therapy. Elevated BCL‑2 protein expression in hematological cancers has been directly correlated with poor responses to conventional therapies and radiation. ZN-d5 is mechanistically similar to approved drug venetoclax (VENCLEXTA®), though it is more highly selective for BCL‑2 over B-cell lymphoma-extra-large than venetoclax, which may reduce thrombocytopenia and provide higher therapeutic benefit for this patient population, particularly when combined with other anti-cancer agents where modification of therapeutic doses due to the development of cytopenias could impact efficacy. 
Combination - Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of ZN-d5 and Azenosertib in Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (R/R AML) (ZN-d5-004C)
ZN-d5 is being evaluated in combination with azenosertib in a Phase 1/2 dose escalation clinical trial in patients with R/R AML. The Phase 1 portion of this trial will escalate the doses of both drugs to identify the RP2D for the combination, which will be assessed in Phase 2 expansion cohort(s). This study is expected to enroll up to approximately 100 patients. This clinical trial is supported by preclinical models that showed that the combination of ZN-d5 with azenosertib yielded a significant enhancement of activity in several indications, including R/R AML, as compared to activity shown with either of these product candidates as a single agent. Preclinical models also showed that the combination of ZN-d5 with azenosertib was well tolerated in mice. We believe we are the only company to have both a Wee1 inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor in clinical development. 
R/ R AML is defined by the malignant clonal expansion of a progenitor cells coupled with a differentiation arrest. Of all subtypes of leukemia, R/R AML accounts for the highest percentage (62%) of leukemic deaths. Patients unable to tolerate induction chemotherapy owing to age or comorbid conditions are traditionally treated with hypomethylating agents, or HMA, or low-dose cytarabine, or LDAC. More recently, venetoclax (VENCLEXTA®), a small molecule BH3 mimetic BCL-2 inhibitor, has become a standard treatment, in combination with HMA or LDAC, for this population. However, a substantial portion of patients do not respond to, or relapse after, treatment with venetoclax-based combinations. ZN-d5 is mechanistically similar to venetoclax, though it is designed to be more highly selective for BCL-2 over BCL-xL than venetoclax which may reduce thrombocytopenia. Given the established utility of BH3 mimetics and the potential role of Wee1 inhibition in treating R/R AML, combining the BCL‑2 inhibitor ZN-d5 with the Wee1 inhibitor ZN-c3 may provide a meaningful benefit for patients and provide advantages over existing regimens. 
BCL-xL Heterobifunctional Degrader
Overview
In November 2022, we announced that we identified a BCL-xL protein degrader candidate and initiated IND-enabling studies. We are developing a BCL-xL heterobifunctional degrader based on non-functional or dysfunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase complex in platelets, allowing for the potential mitigation of dose-limiting thrombocytopenia historically associated with BCL-xL inhibitors.
BCL-xL is a member of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein family and participates in the regulation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. BCL-xL is often upregulated in hematological and solid malignancies. It is involved in tumor survival and resistance to chemotherapy and venetoclax (VENCLEXTA®). Navitoclax, a dual BCL-2/BCL-xL inhibitor, has shown clinical activity in hematopoietic malignancies but was found to be dose-limited because of thrombocytopenia driven by BCL-xL inhibition.
We believe our BCL-xL candidate has the potential to meet an unmet medical need based on its potency observed to date. As demonstrated in preclinical models, the degradation of BCL-xL in tumor cells with our BCL-xL protein degrader candidate was associated with a decrease in cell viability.
Preclinical Results
As shown in the diagrams below, in the MOLT4 tumor model (T-ALL), our BCL-xL protein degrader candidate demonstrated strong activity and was well tolerated at the evaluated doses. This model also showed that our BCL-xL protein degrader candidate was more efficacious than navitoclax.
We also believe that the development of our BCL-xL protein degrader candidates offers an opportunity for development in combination with other cancer agents, such as azenosertib. As shown below, azenosertib combined with a low dose of navitoclax resulted in synergistic anti-tumor activity in the T-ALL model MOLT-4:
Integrated Discovery Engine
We are also currently advancing our research on protein degraders and other undisclosed targets utilizing our Integrated Discovery Engine. Our Integrated Discovery Engine has enabled us to take each of our clinical-stage product candidates from initial discovery to IND submission in less than three years, with a total of four FDA-cleared INDs in a span of five years. We begin our process of drug discovery by identifying fundamental biological pathways of cancers based upon a number of factors, including validation of the pathway through prior clinical outcomes and ability to impact large patient populations. We then analyze existing marketed products and compounds in development that target these cancer pathways and assess their limitations, efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK, patient convenience and potential to be used in combination with other therapies. Next, we use our medicinal chemistry expertise and extensive understanding of structure based drug design and target-structure activity relationships to design product candidates with properties that we believe can address observed limitations and suboptimal drug characteristics of marketed products or other compounds in development, including potency, solubility, route of administration and PK properties. 
We believe overcoming these limitations may also allow us to develop these product candidates for use in combination with other therapies, including with our internally-developed product candidates, if approved. Finally, we strive to generate preclinical data to support that such candidates could have a differentiated product profile in our expected lead indications before advancing a compound into clinical development. 
Manufacturing
We currently do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. We require that our CMOs produce bulk drug substance and finished drug product in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and all other applicable laws and regulations. We maintain agreements with our CMOs that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates. 
We have engaged CMOs to manufacture, package, label and distribute azenosertib and ZN-d5 for preclinical and clinical use. We obtain our clinical trial supplies from these CMOs on a purchase order basis and do not have long-term supply arrangements in place. Although we do not currently have contractual arrangements in place for redundant supply for each component of the supply chain for either of these product candidates, we currently mitigate potential supply risks for azenosertib and ZN-d5 through inventory management. More broadly, for each of our product candidates, we intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide the raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product prior to seeking regulatory approval.
Competition 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological advancement, significant competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. While we believe that our product candidates, development capabilities, experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many 
different sources, including major and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize medicines that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or less expensive than any medicines we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates, if approved, will include efficacy, combinability, safety profile, convenience, cost, level of promotional activity devoted to them and intellectual property protection.

Schrödinger has disclosed that its Wee1 program is currently in preclinical development and that it plans to select a Wee1 inhibitor development candidate and initiate IND-enabling studies in 2023, with the expectation of submitting an IND in the first half of 2024.
ZN-d5
AbbVie Inc. has developed and received regulatory approval for venetoclax (VENCLEXTA®), a BCL-2 inhibitor used to treat hematological malignancies. Ascentage Pharma is clinically evaluating a selective BCL-2 inhibitor, lisaftoclax (APG-2575) as both a monotherapy and in combination with other agents for the treatment of multiple hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. BeiGene, Ltd. is clinically evaluating BGB-11417, a selective BCL-2 inhibitor in hematologic malignancies as a monotherapy or in combination with other agents.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates and continuing innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position. In addition, we plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions or adjustments when available. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions and improvements; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including any patents that we may own in the future; and to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. Intellectual property rights may not address all potential threats to our competitive advantage. 
With respect to our product candidates and processes we intend to develop and commercialize in the normal course of business, we intend, or understand that our licensors intend, to pursue patent protection covering, when possible, compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations. We or our licensors also may pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies. Obtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies. We 
or our licensors may not be able to obtain patent protections for our compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations, manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies throughout the world. Issued patents can provide protection for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In general, patents issued for applications filed in the United States can provide exclusionary rights for 20 years from the earliest non-provisional or PCT filing date. In addition, in certain instances, the term of an issued U.S. patent that is directed to or claims an FDA-approved product can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, which is called “patent term extension.” The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The term of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest non-provisional or PCT filing date plus any extensions of term that may be available under national law. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent. Patent term may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of time. 
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of biopharmaceuticals has emerged in the United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States are also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions and improvements. We cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. Patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology, and our issued patents may be challenged, invalidated, deemed unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing-related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent directed to such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides. 
In-licensed Patents and Patent Applications
Our wholly owned subsidiary, Zeno Management, Inc., or ZMI, has exclusively in-licensed or is the owner/assignee of issued patents and patent applications directed to our technology across our pipeline in the United States and many other major jurisdictions worldwide, including Europe, Japan and China. Certain issued patents and patent applications directed to azenosertib, ZN-d5 and our BCL-xL product candidate have been exclusively in-licensed from Recurium IP Holdings, LLC, or Recurium IP. For additional information on our license agreement with Recurium IP, see Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—License Agreements and Strategic Collaborations" and Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
The expected expiration dates for issued patents, or patents that may issue from any patent applications, directed to our Wee1 inhibitor program, including azenosertib, are between 2038 and 2043 plus any extensions or adjustments of term available under national law. The expected expiration dates for the patents, or patents that may issue from any patent applications, directed to our BCL-2 inhibitor program, including ZN-d5, are between 2039 and 2043 plus any extensions or adjustments of term available under national law. The expected expiration date for the patent, or patents that may issue from any patent applications, directed to our BCL-xL protein degrader program is 2043 plus any extensions or adjustments of term available under national law. However, there can be no assurance that any of the pending patent applications will issue. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustments to the term 
of any of the issued patents or patents that may issue from any pending patent applications in the future. The applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, may not agree with our assessment of whether such patent term extensions or adjustments should be granted, and, if granted, they may grant more limited extensions or adjustments than we request. 
Trademarks
Our trademark portfolio contains the following trademarks applications or registrations. U.S. trademark applications are pending for each of the marks ZENTALIS and the stylized “Z” mark. Applications to register each of the marks ZENTALIS and the stylized “Z” have been filed internationally.
Furthermore, we rely upon know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with an employee or a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
License Agreements and Strategic Collaborations
Recurium IP Holdings, LLC License Agreement
In December 2014, our wholly owned subsidiary, Zeno Pharmaceuticals, Inc., entered into a license agreement, or the Recurium Agreement, with Recurium IP, which was subsequently amended, under which Zeno Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was granted an exclusive worldwide license to certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Recurium IP to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products for the treatment or prevention of disease, other than for providing pain relief. Following certain corporate restructuring disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report on 10-K, our wholly owned subsidiary, ZMI, became the Zentalis contracting party to the Recurium Agreement. The intellectual property rights licensed by ZMI under the Recurium Agreement include certain intellectual property covering azenosertib, ZN-d5 and our BCL-xL product candidate. See Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—License Agreements and Strategic Collaborations" and Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.
Pfizer Development Agreement 
In April 2022, we entered into a development agreement with Pfizer to collaborate to advance the clinical development of azenosertib. We did not grant Pfizer any economic ownership or control of azenosertib or the rest of our pipeline. In October 2022, we announced our first clinical development collaboration with Pfizer to initiate a Phase 1/2 dose escalation study of azenosertib, in combination with encorafenib and cetuximab (an FDA-approved standard of care known as the BEACON regimen) in patients with BRAF V600E mutant mCRC. 
GlaxoSmithKline Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement
In April 2021, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with GSK pursuant to which we are evaluating the combination of azenosertib and niraparib, GSK’s poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. See Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—License Agreements and Strategic Collaborations" for additional information.
Zentera Therapeutics
In May 2020, each of our wholly owned subsidiaries Zeno Alpha, Inc., K-Group Alpha, Inc. and K-Group Beta, Inc. entered into a collaboration and license agreement with our joint venture, Zentera, pursuant to which we collaborate with Zentera on the development and commercialization of ZN-c5, ZN-d5 and azenosertib, respectively, in each case for the treatment or prevention of disease, other than for pain, in the People’s Republic of China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan. As disclosed in August 2022, we are discontinuing clinical development of ZN-c5. See Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—License Agreements and Strategic Collaborations" and Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application, or NDA, or Biologics License Application, or BLA, process before it may be legally marketed in the United States.
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements and other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
•submission to the FDA of an NDA/BLA after completion of all pivotal trials;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA/BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, a sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The IND includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, PK, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected AEs, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
•Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of postmarketing requirements, including Phase 4 clinical trials, as a condition of approval of an NDA/BLA.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 1, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA/BLA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug. Alternatively, sponsors planning for a Phase 2 registration study will utilize the meetings at the end of the Phase 1 trial to discuss Phase 1 clinical results and present plans for the Phase 2 registration study that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
U.S. Review and Approval Process
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA/BLA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an 
NDA/BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs/BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs/BLAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting the application for filing, to determine whether it is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review because incompleteness can lead to refusal to file. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA/BLA for filing. In this event, the NDA/BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once filed, the FDA reviews an NDA/BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA/BLA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two (2) months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted. 
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee if they feel there is an issue regarding the benefit/risk of the drug. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA/BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA/BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. 
After the FDA evaluates an NDA/BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications and outlines post-marketing requirements with milestone dates. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA/BLA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional clinical trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA/BLA or, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA/BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for a particular indication(s) and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. The FDA may also approve the NDA/BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. Once a drug is approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also mandate post-marketing requirements, including one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance, to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.

In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs/BLAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the 
pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. 
Fast Track Designation
The FDA has a fast track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, product candidates are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development. With regard to a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA/BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA/BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA/BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA/BLA.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers at FDA. 
Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation or breakthrough therapy designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. 
Priority Review
An NDA/BLA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six (6) months of the FDA's acceptance for filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs/BLAs under its current PDUFA review goals.
Accelerated Approval
In addition, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA generally requires that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled confirmatory clinical trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required confirmatory studies in a timely manner, or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States. An applicant must request orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA/BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for limited grant funding towards clinical trial costs, research tax advantages, and user fee waivers. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. This means the FDA may not approve any other applications, including full NDAs/BLAs, to market the same drug, as defined by the FDA, for the same disease or condition for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same disease or condition or the same product for a different disease or condition. Orphan exclusivity also could block the approval of a product for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or if such drug is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same disease or condition. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for a disease or condition broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program
In 2012, Congress authorized the FDA to award priority review vouchers to sponsors of certain rare pediatric disease product applications. This program is designed to encourage development of new drug and biological products for prevention and treatment of certain rare pediatric diseases. Specifically, under this program, a sponsor who receives an approval for a drug or biologic for a “rare pediatric disease” may qualify for a voucher that can be redeemed to receive a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. The sponsor of a rare pediatric disease drug product receiving a priority review voucher may transfer, including by sale, the voucher to another sponsor. The voucher may be further transferred any number of times before the voucher is used, as long as the sponsor making the transfer has not yet submitted the application. The FDA may also revoke any priority review voucher if the rare pediatric disease drug for which the voucher was awarded is not marketed in the U.S. within one year following the date of approval.
For purposes of this program, a “rare pediatric disease” is a (a) serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents; and (b) rare diseases or conditions within the meaning of the Orphan Drug Act. Congress has only authorized the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program until September 30, 2024. Consequently, sponsors of marketing applications approved after that date will not receive the voucher unless Congress reauthorizes the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program before that time. However, even if the program is not reauthorized, if a drug candidate receives Rare Pediatric Disease Designation before October 1, 2024, the sponsor of the marketing application for such drug will be eligible to receive a voucher if the application for the designated drug is approved by the FDA before October 1, 2026.
Post-approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required 
to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
•clinical holds on clinical studies;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
•mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
•the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labelling.
Marketing Exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances.
The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, which was signed into law in March 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA. The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. 
Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biological product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. This 12-year exclusivity period is referred to as the reference product exclusivity period and bars approval of a biosimilar but notably does not prevent approval of a competing product pursuant to a full BLA (i.e., containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of the product). The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity, and enforceability prior to the approval of the biosimilar. 
Foreign Government Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, post-marketing requirements and any commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. 
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or prior to marketing of the product candidates in those countries. Approval by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. The approval process varies from country to country, can involve additional testing beyond that required by FDA, and may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, may be subject to, among other things, fines or operating restrictions.
Other Healthcare Laws
Pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, consumer fraud, pricing reporting, and transparency laws and regulations as well as similar state and foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in penalties, including, without limitation, significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject 
to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. As a result, the coverage determination process can require manufactures to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately and can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics.
Third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for pharmaceutical products and services. The U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are more and more challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability for manufacturers to sell products profitably.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of example, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order initiating a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers, which will remain in effect through 2032, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, absent additional congressional action. In addition, on March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, or AMP, beginning January 1, 2024.
Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated. In addition, individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
FDA Approval and Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, if FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. The review of in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our therapeutic treatments for cancer will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health.
Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. 
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States generally requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, or approval of a premarket approval, or a PMA application. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. While most Class I devices—devices that generally pose a low risk to users—are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are automatically placed in Class III, 
requiring approval of a PMA unless down-classified in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. 
To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements or request down-classification of the device through the “de novo” process. 
The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process, and can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, a PMA application typically requires data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California consumers (defined to include all California residents) certain rights, including the right to ask companies to disclose the types of personal information collected, specific pieces of information collected by a company, the categories of sources from which such information was collected, the business purpose for collecting or selling the consumer’s personal information, and the categories of third parties with whom a company shares personal information. The CCPA also imposes obligations on companies to provide notice to California consumers regarding a company’s data processing activities. Additionally, the CCPA gives California consumers the 
right to ask companies to delete a consumer’s personal information and places limitations on a company’s ability to sell personal information, including providing consumers a right to opt out of sales of their personal information. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which generally went into effect on January 1, 2023, and significantly expands the CCPA to incorporate additional provisions, including a requirement that the use, retention, and sharing of personal information of California residents be reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes of collection or processing, granting additional protections for sensitive personal information, and requiring greater disclosures related to notice to residents regarding retention of information. The CPRA also expands personal information rights of California residents, including creating a right to opt out of sharing of personal information with third parties for advertising, expanding the lookback period for the right to know about personal information held by businesses, and expanding the right to erasure for information held by third parties. 
In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area, or EEA. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with the GDPR and also the United Kingdom GDPR, or UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
Social 
Zentalis aims to drive positive social impact, including by improving the lives of cancer patients through our therapeutics and our focus on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, or DE&I. Below are a few initiatives that demonstrate our focus on social impact:
