Introduction 



Our mission is to help people feel and live better through innovative comfort solutions.



We began as a digitally-native vertical brand founded on comfort product innovation with premium offerings, and are now omni-channel. We offer a variety of innovative, branded and premium comfort products, including mattresses, pillows, cushions, bases, sheets and more. Our products are the result of decades of innovation and investment in proprietary and patented comfort technologies and the development of our own manufacturing processes. Our proprietary Hyper-Elastic Polymer gel technology underpins many of our comfort products and provides a range of benefits that differentiate our offerings from other competitors’ products. Specially engineered to relieve pressure, maintain an ideal body temperature, and provide instantly adaptive support, Purple’s patented technology has been used and tested rigorously within medical and consumer applications for over 30 years. Originally designed for use in hospital beds and wheelchairs, we adapted this unique pressure-relieving material for our mattresses and other cushion products.



We market and sell our products through direct-to-consumer e-commerce and Purple owned retail showrooms (collectively “DTC”) and retail wholesale partners.



The foundation of our business is core competencies in design, development and manufacturing. Our accumulated knowledge enables us to create all aspects of our innovative products, including fundamental comfort technologies and machines and processes necessary to bring them to market. We have integrated our operations to include research and development, marketing and manufacturing, resulting in an ability to rapidly test, learn, adapt and scale our product offerings. In order to solve complex manufacturing challenges such as large-format injection molding of our Hyper-Elastic Polymer cushioning material, we designed and produced our own manufacturing equipment including our proprietary and patented molding machinery. These fully customized machines are unique to Purple and, we believe, can handle both our size and scale requirements. We believe our combination of patents and intellectual property, proprietary and patented manufacturing equipment, production processes and decades of acquired knowledge create an advantage over our competitors who rely on commoditized materials, such as foam and outsourced manufacturing.



In addition to developing differentiated products and technologies, we have built a brand that we believe has high customer engagement and avid brand advocates. We have an experienced marketing team, providing efficient customer acquisition and brand demand development. Our marketing strategy enables us to market our full product suite to customers, generate frequent interactions online and drive traffic to all channels offering our products.



Our knowledge of and engagement with consumers across digital and brick and mortar retail channels is advantageous and increasing. To complement our DTC efforts, we have developed multiple wholesale relationships with best-in-class retailers in the furniture, mattress specialty, home décor, and department store spaces. Our goal is to provide opportunities for each customer to learn, shop, and buy in the way that works for them. We believe our distinctly differentiated products, including newly broadened spectrum of mattresses across price points, comfort preferences, benefit segments, marketing strategies, manufacturing capabilities, unique branding and proprietary technologies position us to continue to drive our growth. In 2022, our DTC sales, which includes online and Purple owned retail showrooms, accounted for 57.4% of our net revenues and wholesale accounted for 42.6% of net revenues, while sales of sleep products accounted for 91.2% of our net revenues and other products accounted for 8.8%.



In 2022, we grew our DTC efforts by adding 27 Purple owned retail showrooms, making a total of 55 Company locations across the United States. We anticipate opening 11 additional Purple owned retail showrooms throughout 2023 and in the future.

Industry and Competition 



Our portfolio of products is driven by our commitment to innovating real comfort solutions that meaningfully help people sleep, feel and live better. Whether it’s getting a better night’s rest or elevating the work from home experience, we design and manufacture truly innovative, differentiated products that put our customers’ comfort first.
Sleep Products 



The sleep products category encompasses a variety of products including mattresses, pillows, bases, foundations, sheets, mattress protectors, blankets and duvets. Meaningful innovation in sleep products has remained stagnant and limited over the last 150 years. Coil spring mattresses and memory foam, two of the primary materials underpinning mattress technology today, were invented in the 1860’s and 1990’s. Latex, water and air mattresses followed, emerging in the latter part of the 20th century. Since these early inventions, the sleep product industry has remained complacent with little meaningful innovation, until the introduction of our proprietary Hyper-Elastic Polymer material, which represents a meaningful innovation in pressure relief, temperature neutrality, responsiveness, durability and limited motion transfer. Our proprietary technology solves problems that regular mattresses create and has proven that material innovations can have a positive impact on sleep.



Beginning in 2015, the market for sleep products underwent a fundamental transformation with the rise of e-commerce-based brands and direct to consumer distribution, which disrupted the traditional category dynamics and drove the majority of category growth (versus traditional mattress companies) for several years. Today, the U.S. sleep product industry has rebalanced to be comprised of vendors that rely on retail distribution as well as a consolidated number of direct-to-consumer retailers who have tried to expand brick and mortar distribution to capture more market share in a category still tied to instore product trials. Amidst this changing category dynamic, Purple’s manufacturing capabilities paired with our strategic mix of showrooms, e-commerce and third-party retailers, has allowed us to gain share and be a leader in the sleep products category.



In 2022, we acquired Advanced Comfort Technologies, Inc., dba Intellibed (“Intellibed”), a premium sleep and health wellness company that was a pre-existing licensee of our founders of some of our technologies. That acquisition resulted in us owning the sole right to use all of our Hyper-Elastic Polymer technologies in our beds. In addition, the acquisition will allow us to immediately expand into the luxury mattress segment. Purple has recently announced three collections to be available in the second quarter of 2023: Essentials (including the New Day, The Purple Mattress, and The Purple Plus), Premium (including Restore, RestorePlus, and RestorePremier) and Luxe (including Rejuvenate, RejuvenatePlus and RejuvenatePremier).



In general, direct to consumer mattress companies offer convenience, free shipping and returns, and low prices, while leveraging third-party manufacturing and distribution. Materials used by online mattress retailers include layers of foam cushioning that are assembled, compressed and folded into a box for distribution. This market is highly fragmented, commoditized and competitive, with customer purchase decisions based primarily on price. Prior to Purple, there has been little recent success disrupting the premium market, where the majority of category revenue and profit is realized. Competitors in the premium market include Tempur Sealy and Sleep Number.



While e-commerce home goods purchases have increased over the past five years, traditional brick-and-mortar retailers command a significant part of the market for mattress products. This part of the retail market is also highly fragmented and competitive. The leading brick-and-mortar specialty mattress retailers in the United States and Canada are, respectively, Mattress Firm and Sleep Country Canada, both of which Purple has significant partnerships with. These national retailers compete with both regional and local retailers as well as furniture and department stores. Purple has also expanded into many of these regional furniture retailers.



Across these channels, some key factors that impact competition in our industry include comfort feel, product features, reliable logistics and manufacturing capabilities, marketing efficacy and efficiency, brand differentiation, expertise of sales associates, customer care, pace of innovation and product roadmap, price of products and services, financial stability and ability to invest in innovation.

What Makes Purple Different? 



We believe we have a particular set of competitive strengths that differentiate and position us for continued success:




● | History of innovation that produced new comfort technology—We are a company built on innovation and licensing, with more than 30 years of expertise in comfort innovation. Purple is founded upon decades of history developing innovative comfort solutions, including the invention of our proprietary and patented Hyper-Elastic Polymer technology. Our breakthrough mattress represents what we believe to be the first substantive innovation in the sleep product industry since the introduction of memory foam in 1992. We believe that the unique properties of our technology enable several improvements to existing sleep products that are not addressed by foam, spring and air mattresses.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pressure Relief—Our Hyper-Elastic Polymer technology is designed around the science of column buckling which enables our mattresses to be both firm and soft. This offers support across the body’s larger surface areas, such as the back, while providing pressure relief at local areas or points of pressure, such as the hips and shoulders. We believe Purple’s founders were the first to leverage this technology in mattresses after its success in licensing its proprietary Hyper-Elastic Polymer technology to medical manufacturers for use in wheelchairs, critical care beds and to this day, hospital beds. The resulting feel is often described as buoyant and responsive.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Temperature Neutral—The Hyper-Elastic Polymer material itself is temperature neutral, with the surface comprised mostly of air, made from thousands of open-air channels. The channels allow for high airflow and dissipation of heat and vapor. This is the opposite of foam beds, which absorb heat from the body and then radiate the heat back, constantly increasing the temperature. Our technology allows for continual sleeping without waking up hot.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Responsive—Unlike memory foam, which compresses, gets hard and then takes time to recoil, our Hyper-Elastic Polymer technology is instantly responsive to the body as it moves. It will immediately flex to support the sleeper’s position and spring back into place as the sleeper readjusts during the night.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Durable—Hyper-Elastic Polymer material is a highly durable gel that we believe is more durable than most foams. The Hyper-Elastic Polymer technology also has numerous applications beyond mattress products including seat cushions, pillows, and others. The development of the Hyper-Elastic Polymer technology is only one of numerous innovations we have developed to produce a range of unique and effective comfort products across the sleep, seat cushion and other categories.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Proprietary technologies and manufacturing expertise provide a significant competitive advantage—We believe the combination of patent protection, proprietary manufacturing equipment and decades of accumulated knowledge creates a competitive advantage through barriers to imitation. We have hundreds of granted or pending patents and hundreds of patent filings that cover current and future products as well as proprietary manufacturing equipment we have designed and fabricated. In addition to intellectual property protection of key products and manufacturing capabilities, our team has in depth experience and unique insights derived from inventing and refining proprietary comfort technologies, machines and products. Our patented and proprietary molding processes and machines allow for large-format injection molding of gels efficiently and at scale.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Growing a brand with a passionate following—Our brand mirrors our passion for uncompromising performance, quality and durability, and our dedication to improving lives by delivering better sleep and better comfort We believe our brand awareness and consideration rivals category leaders, after only seven years. Our brand has extended beyond awareness of individual products and we have successfully marketed our full suite of products to customers using our omni-channel strategy. We believe our customers’ satisfaction with our product has continued to drive “word of mouth” recommendations, one of the most persuasive ways customers learn about our products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Balanced, omni-channel distribution strategy—We have sought opportunities to expand brand awareness in brick-and-mortar retailers where our beds can be displayed. This is a very different approach from most bed-in-a-box players who seek traditional consumer packaged goods distribution, e.g., boxes on shelves. Our goal is to support the customer wherever and however they want to learn, try, and buy. Whether in wholesale, Purple owned retail showrooms, or our e-commerce channel, we are a leader in the sleep products market. Our flexible return policies and aggressive expansion of wholesale doors and our own showrooms allow for more of our targeted customers to feel and experience our products throughout the purchase process. In our wholesale channel, we sell most of our products through select national and regional retailers as well as a variety of independent retail partners throughout the United States and Canada. As a result, we believe we will drive accelerated growth in the sleep products industry.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Vertical integration enables nimble design, development and execution—We design and develop our products in-house and we have extensive research and development capabilities led by a team of engineers, industrial designers and marketing specialists. The ability to develop and test products in this manner enables us to not only prototype and deploy new ideas, but also design and develop corresponding manufacturing equipment and processes. In addition, we continuously refine our production methods to improve product quality and enhance efficiency. The resulting real-time feedback cycle is a key differentiator compared to other competitors that outsource many of these functions and lack an integrated approach. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth Strategies 




● | Expansion of the Brand to Premium and Luxe Categories— To complement and support our expansion into the higher-priced, higher margin categories, Purple is evolving its differentiated brand to broaden appeal. We are investing in brand demand-driving marketing and advertising to create awareness, engagement, and preference for the Purple brand and for our products across all our sales channels. We also plan on developing a reimagined brand associated with life enhancing sleep. In 2023, we expect to be able to increase effective marketing by 11% over the prior year with an anticipated 40% increase occurring after the launch of our new Premium and Luxe product categories anticipated to occur on May 15 in our showrooms and online and from May to July in our wholesale partners’ retail stores. This strategic focus and investment will support our growth plans in the wholesale channel, in Purple owned retail showrooms, on Purple.com and online marketplaces, and in particular our Luxe offerings are expected to increase average sales prices significantly. We’ll also continue to harness the evangelism of the ever-growing base of Purple owners whose advocacy of our products is one of the brand’s greatest strengths. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Further direct-to-consumer growth and penetration—We believe that we are well positioned to leverage our brand, leading product portfolio, vertical integration and strong marketing capabilities to continue to attract new customers via our e-commerce channel. We have invested in substantial improvements to our website, enhancing the education, shopping, and buying experiences, and we have expanded our contact center, enabling live voice, chat and messaging with our sales associates which has driven higher customer satisfaction, higher average order value, and higher conversion. Continued successful execution on Purple.com supports planned e-commerce growth, and growth in all channels given the importance of the site during the customer decision journey. In addition, we currently operate 55 Company showrooms in cities across the U.S. where consumers can experience our brand, learn about and engage with our technology, and purchase our products. We anticipate continual expansion of our showrooms as we optimize the format.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expanded wholesale retail relationships— We continue to work closely with existing retail partners to increase market share and sales, and we are forming new partnerships to expand our wholesale footprint. With our new Premium and Luxe collections, we believe we have an increased opportunity to tap into the large brick-and-mortar category of the sleep products market. Currently during 2023, we anticipate increasing the number of beds in our approximate 3,400 doors by 1.2 to 1.4 beds per door, on a blended basis, which already is over our initial goal for the year of a 20% increase, and we believe this will contribute an estimated $1,000 to $1,500 per month per incremental slot. We believe this is a result of the developing interest in our Premium and Luxe product categories which allows retailers to place these products as alternatives to other premium products to increase sales on high-end mattresses with materially higher margins for the retailer and Purple. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Existing product innovation—We have a rich history of product innovation and have developed core competencies in design, prototyping and manufacturing. This vertical integration enables us to continuously refine our existing products and manufacturing processes, as well as introduce new offerings, with the potential to attract new customers and drive repeat sales. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | New product launches—We have focused intensively on innovation, and we expect to launch more new mattresses in 2023 than all other years of our operations combined to support our long-range growth plan, with more to come. We have a pipeline of future products we are developing. We are constantly exploring new technologies and ways to expand the benefits of our technologies through new product offerings. This includes innovations in mattresses beyond our Hyper-Elastic Polymer technology, an expanded assortment based on the Harmony Pillow that includes new patent-pending technology, other assortment expansion and new products in sleep, comfort and additional categories.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | International expansion—We believe there is a substantial opportunity for international expansion, and we expect to find new opportunities as we expand into foreign markets. We entered the Canada market in Q4 2020 via the wholesale retailer Sleep Country Canada and we plan to expand in other foreign markets in the future. We believe that our differentiated products, multi-channel distribution strategy, manufacturing capabilities, vertical integration and marketing expertise will enable us to successfully enter new markets.

Our Hyper-Elastic Polymer products are manufactured with non-toxic ingredients that are third-party tested and free from carcinogenic chemicals. The patented Hyper-Elastic Polymer technology is used in all Purple mattresses. The buckling columns in our mattresses instantly adapt to your body to cradle your hips and shoulders while supporting your spine’s natural alignment for uniquely buoyant, supportive comfort. We back up the quality and durability of our mattress with a 100-night trial and a ten-year warranty. Beginning in 2023, we will have three collections – Essentials, Premium, and Luxe, with mattresses ranging from our original Purple, to our redesigned and improved Premium and Luxe mattresses, all of which include our Hyper-Elastic Polymer technology. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pillows—We currently sell five types of pillows: The Purple Harmony Pillow, the Purple Pillow, the Purple Twin Cloud Pillow, the Purple Cloud Pillow™ and the Kids Pillow. The Purple Harmony Pillow is a hybrid, hypoallergenic pillow featuring the world’s first and only tapered 360º Hyper-Elastic Polymer Grid Hex surrounding a soft, responsive Talalay latex core for optimal head and neck support. It has a cool-to-the-touch, moisture-wicking breathable cover to enhance the benefits of our Hyper-Elastic Polymer technology. It’s the ultimate balance of soft, cool, and responsive no pressure support. The Purple Pillow is a head-specific triangular grid-shape to protect against breaking down or losing shape. The Purple Twin Cloud Pillow is a hypoallergenic down-alternative that features our patented cover construction which includes two chambers filled with gel fibers that double up for better sleep. The Purple Cloud Pillow is filled with hypoallergenic, ultra-fine gel fibers that won’t clump, trap heat, or flatten over time. The result is plush cushioning that molds to support the head and neck. The Kids Pillow is smaller and softer than our original Purple pillow and adjusted to fit smaller sleepers. We believe our pillows are unique, with no other products in the market like them in appearance, design, functionality or comfort. We also back up the quality and durability of our pillows with a 100-night trial and a one-year warranty. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sheets—We sell two types of sheets and pillowcases. Made from stretchy and breathable bamboo-based Viscose, our SoftStretch sheets are designed to maximize the functionality of our mattresses and pillows. We developed our own technology to enable customers to experience the full performance potential of our mattress (or any other mattress). We also sell more traditional cotton-based Complete Comfort sheets designed to have cushion enhancing two-way stretch. Our sheet sets include pillowcases that also maximize the unique functionality of our pillows.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mattress Protector—Like our sheets, our mattress protector is designed to optimize the functionality of our Hyper-Elastic Polymer technology in our mattress. Our mattress protector is stretchy and breathable. Our protector is also stain-resistant and machine-washable, making it easy to clean.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Bases—Our bases have been designed to pair with our mattresses and meet the needs of our customers. Our Purple Ascent Adjustable Base complements our mattresses by adding electrically powered functions, such as adjustable head and foot positions, zero-gravity preset for a near weightless feel, a “sitting” preset, under-bed lighting and a remote with cradle that provides additional USB ports for device charging. Our Purple Bed Frame is easy to ship and assemble, with no tools required. It has the look of a stylish upholstered bed frame. The supports are made of high-density polyethylene, so they don’t creak or make noise like wood supports. Plus, the joints of the Purple Bed Frame are reinforced with nylon buffers to help prevent squeaking. Our Purple Platform Bed Frame is designed specifically for all current Purple bed sizes and offers a high quality, simpler alternative to our more premium offerings. Constructed from lightweight steel, the Purple Platform Bed provides optimal support and prevents the mattress from sagging. Beginning in 2023, we plan to introduce the Purple Premium and Purple Premium Plus smart bases, a new line of smart adjustable bases that are designed to pair with the new mattresses for the ideal Purple sleep experience.

Technology 



Technology is key to our unique position within the sleep products industry. The introduction of our proprietary Hyper-Elastic Polymer material is the first major innovation to the consumer mattress category in decades. Mattresses from our competitors are typically manufactured using one or more layers of springs, standard polyurethane foam, memory foam, air chambers or latex foam. These technologies have existed for decades and are undifferentiated from competitors within their product type.
Proprietary Technologies 



The Purple innovation team, through their scientific journey to get to the root causes of pressure sores, designed the Hyper-Elastic Polymer material and other proprietary comfort technologies in order to improve the lives of “every body.” Each different cushioning product line requires unique molding techniques.



Our Hyper-Elastic Polymer material is non-toxic and hypoallergenic. This proprietary material is also durable and will not develop body impressions (compression set) from use over time. It is elastic and can stretch up to 15 times its original size and return without losing its shape. It sleeps and sits temperature-neutral and has good ventilation to inhibit moisture build-up.



Our Hyper-Elastic Polymer material is both soft and supportive. While the columns in this structure provide support where it is needed, they also buckle where it is needed to reduce pressure by allowing shoulders and hips to sink into the cushion with reduced force pushing back on those areas of the body unlike other cushion technologies. The soft and flexible columns also return to their original position as forces lessen and are capable of immediately providing support.



Proprietary Machinery 



Internally designed, developed and built, our patented and proprietary molding machines are the only machines able to mold our Hyper-Elastic Polymer material into large-format king-sized mattresses at scale. We have modified other molding machines to manufacture additional products containing Hyper-Elastic Polymer material. We also acquired in the Intellibed acquisition the patented manufacturing machine and process we owned that had been licensed by our founders, preventing others from obtaining access to that technology. The process of molding our Hyper-Elastic Polymer material using our molding machinery is proprietary, patent-protected and complex, requiring specific knowledge and expertise to successfully execute manufacturing. We have vertically integrated with our own machine shop with mechanics and engineers at each of our factories to maintain our machines and other equipment. Furthermore, we have extensive in-house fabrication capabilities, which enable us to design, manufacture, install and maintain new equipment as well as optimize the performance and efficiency of our existing machinery based on real-time insights gained from our vertically integrated operations.
Marketing 



We have developed a brand that resonates with consumers. Our marketing efforts are focused on building awareness of the Purple brand and illustrating the unique way our products deliver better sleep and comfort. We leverage data-driven marketing across all communication channels to engage, acquire, and retain customers. We also amplify the voices of our evangelical product owners, whose word-of-mouth recommendation is one of our most powerful (and ownable) marketing vehicles. Deep engagement with current customers enables us to increase additional product sales across our portfolio of offerings. The success we have achieved through our marketing campaigns has been key to rapidly building our branding and awareness. We plan to launch our elevated brand positioning with a gradual transition in our wholesale partners’ stores during the period of May 2023 through July 2023 with a hard conversion in our owned retails stores and online occurring on May 15, 2023 as we build our premium brand position to grow market share of the premium mattress category during the second half of 2023.
Our Sales Channels 



We sell our products via Purple.com, online marketplaces (e.g., Amazon), our Purple owned retail showrooms, and wholesale retailers.



Direct-to-Consumer Channel 



Our e-commerce distribution channel is a critical hub for consumer education and consumer engagement, as well as conversion. We have benefitted from the rapid growth of the direct-to-consumer channel in the sleep product industry in addition to our differentiated product offering and unique marketing campaigns. We sell directly to consumers through our website, our customer contact center and online marketplaces. With our website and customer contact center, we help customers easily engage in relevant content, research our solutions, transact online or via our customer contact center, or find the nearest retailer. We believe our online experience expands our brand and connections with consumers, enabling deeper awareness, engagement and brand loyalty. We believe our 100-night trial, ten-year warranty, attractive financing options, strong customer testimonials and excellent service provide confidence to consumers in buying a mattress.





6







We operate 55 Purple owned retail showrooms across the United States where consumers can experience our brand, learn and engage with our technology and purchase our products. We plan to continue expanding our showroom footprint across the United States.



Wholesale Channel 



We sell our assortment of products through brick-and-mortar and online wholesale partners. We began selling mattresses and other sleep products through our largest wholesale partner, Mattress Firm, in November 2017 and have continued to expand the number of wholesale partners where our mattresses and other sleep products are sold. We now sell mattresses through Ashley Furniture, Big Sandy, City Furniture, Furniture Row, HOM Furniture, Macy’s, Mathis Brothers, Mattress Firm, Raymour & Flanigan, Rooms To Go, Sleep County Canada and Steinhafels, among others. We typically have four to five mattress models on the floor. Sales associates have been trained and we believe are effective in educating consumers regarding our unique benefits as well as shifting the mix upward to our more premium and higher-margin mattresses. We expect to grow our placements with wholesale partners to give our customers the opportunity to feel the difference of our Hyper-Elastic Polymer technology for themselves.
Operations 



Factories, Supply Chain and Manufacturing 



We operate factories in Grantsville, Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah and McDonough, Georgia, which manufacture Purple products. Our factory in Grantsville has approximately 574,000 square-feet and our factory in McDonough, Georgia, which opened to service our customers on the east coast, provides another 844,000 square-feet. At these factories we manufacture our proprietary Hyper-Elastic Polymer cushioning used in our mattress, pillow and seat cushion products. We also assemble, package and ship our products from these two facilities. Our facility in Salt Lake City was acquired as part of the Intellibed acquisition and has approximately 67,000 square feet. This facility manufactures our proprietary Hyper-Elastic Polymer for assembly in our luxury mattresses. We continually improve our manufacturing processes and create efficiencies in production through new equipment and process designs and resources. We believe these factories will provide ample room to accommodate our future growth and expansion plans for the near term.



We have a number of contract manufacturers who assemble mattresses and have established a network of third-party logistics providers to help with order fulfillment across the United States to minimize delivery times and provide white glove service.



We outsource and resell other products, including adjustable bases, platform bases, sheets, mattress protectors, blankets and duvets. These products are either designed in-house or in partnership and are unique to Purple.



We have relationships with multiple suppliers for our outsourced products and components. These suppliers may be interchanged in order to maintain quality, cost and delivery expectations.



Environmental and Governmental Regulation 



We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign consumer protection and other laws and regulations applicable to the sleep product industry. These laws and regulations vary among the states and countries in which we do and intend to do business. For example, in the United States, we are subject to regulations promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other federal agencies that restrict the generation, emission, treatment, storage and disposal of materials, substances and waste. We are also subject to laws such as the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Our mattress products are also subject to fire-retardant standards developed by the State of California, U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and other jurisdictions where we sell these products.



As a retailer of sleep and cushioning products, we are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to retailers generally, including those regulations governing the marketing and sale of our products and the operation of our e-commerce activities. We are also subject to import and export laws and regulations to the extent our products and their component parts cross international boundaries. Many of these laws and regulations are consumer-focused and pertain to safety, truth-in-advertising, promotional offers, privacy, “do not call/mail” requirements, warranty disclosure, delivery timing requirements and similar requirements.



It is our policy and practice to comply with all applicable domestic and foreign laws and regulations. We have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures necessary to comply with these laws and regulations. These expenditures have been immaterial to our financial results. We have not suffered a material adverse effect from non-compliance with federal, state, local or foreign legislation, but there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such legislation in the future.

Research and Development 



In May 2022, we appointed our first ever Chief Innovation Officer. Our research and development teams are focused primarily on developing new comfort technologies and products. We have recently announced our three mattress collections including our new line of luxury mattresses. We have an extensive history of innovation that is core to our culture and key to our continued success. Our inventions have culminated over years of persistent research and development. We intend to continue to develop and introduce new comfort technologies and products to improve how people live. Our vertical integration is a key differentiator that enhances the effectiveness of our research and development capabilities. By gaining real-time feedback, we can integrate these insights into our manufacturing process, digital marketing, products and equipment. In order to facilitate further innovation and development, we have recently leased a facility that will serve as our new innovation center and will replace the older and remote facility we previously had in Alpine, Utah. This new facility is located in Draper, Utah, close to our headquarters and comprises approximately 61,000 square feet. It is expected that we will occupy the building in June of 2023.

Human Capital



Employees 



At Purple, our focus is to have our employees develop personally, work with talented teammates, and contribute to the success of Purple while working in a safe environment and building an authentic culture. We strive to deliver on our promise of improving the lives of our customers by knowing that our most valuable asset at Purple is our people and their learned institutional knowledge.



As of March 20, 2023, we had approximately 1,600 employees engaged in manufacturing, research and development, general corporate functions, wholesale, ecommerce, and Purple owned retail showrooms. Net of showroom growth, this is down approximately 45% from the end of 2021.



With the appointment of our new Chief People Officer in November 2021, Purple’s People team now operates under the following five pillars that drive our people strategy: Acquire Great Talent, Retain and Develop Great Talent, Build and Strengthen the Foundation of an Exceptional People Experience, Champion an Authentic Values-Based Culture, and Support and Drive the Path to Premium.



Acquire Great Talent



We believe our people are critical for our future success. Therefore, our efforts to acquire great talent begin with inviting the right kind of people to our community. To support this initiative, we are investing in better recruitment technology to improve our candidate experience.
Retain and Develop Great Talent



In 2022, we created Purple’s Center of Excellence, a new resource intended to streamline people operations enterprise-wide, resulting in lower wait times for employees to receive information, resources, and helping to increase the overall efficiency of operations. We also deployed a newly designed Talent Management and Succession Planning program in 2022.Through this program, we identified high potential employees that will form our first mentoring group called the Pinnacle Program, which aims to provide meaningful touchpoints across senior leadership team members and the future leaders of Purple.



In addition to improving the employee experience and constructing a mentorship program, we are also focused on delivering competitive, meaningful, and transparent compensation and benefits to our employees.



Build and Strengthen the Foundation of an Exceptional People Experience



In July 2022, with the appointment of our new Chief Operating Officer, our top priority has been to take action to promote the safety of our employees through various safety initiatives. We retooled our on-site safety departments and modeled them after Safety, Health, and Environment (“SHE”) requirements.



In addition, we continue to invest in new technology to improve communication and enhance our human resource information system functionality to support manager and employee self-service. Paired with our continued dedication to creating shared experiences for employees to connect and build real relationships with those they work with, we believe these efforts will result in a more rewarding employee experience.

Champion an Authentic Values-Based Culture



After our cost restructuring in early 2022, we worked to rebuild our Purple culture. Through executive support and sponsorship, we hosted an employee-led committee that created six new values. Our value roll-out campaign included a roadshow, where all executive senior leadership members as well as committee members met on-site at our facilities in Utah and Georgia, alongside virtual all-hands meetings for our wholesale and retail employees. We plan to continue this work in 2023 with events, trainings, and internal branding.



Support and Drive the Path to Premium



In repositioning to a premium brand, we will rely heavily on our employees to support and drive success. In 2022, we allocated additional resources to our growing wholesale and retail teams. Additionally, with the launch of our new products and wholesale partnerships, we successfully deployed extensive training for our employees and external partners. We believe these efforts have equipped our sales channels with the needed expertise to position our products in the premium category.



Our History 



Purple was created by two brothers that set out to revolutionize the comfort space. One in manufacturing and design, and the other an advanced aerospace scientist, the brothers embarked on a partnership in the early 1990s to put together a team to develop cushioning solutions for wheelchairs and medical beds. They later created what we call Hyper-Elastic Polymer —an elastomeric polymer that can stretch up to 15x its resting size and never lose shape or function. Our proprietary Hyper-Elastic Polymer technology has since been used in mattresses, seat cushions and pillows.
