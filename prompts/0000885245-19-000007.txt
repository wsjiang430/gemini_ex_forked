ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
The Buckle, Inc. (the "Company") is a retailer of medium to better-priced casual apparel, footwear, and accessories for fashion-conscious young men and women. As of February 2, 2019, the Company operated 450 retail stores in 42 states throughout the United States under the names "Buckle" and "The Buckle." The Company markets a wide selection of mostly brand name casual apparel including denims, other casual bottoms, tops, sportswear, outerwear, accessories, and footwear. The Company emphasizes personalized attention to its customers and provides customer services such as free hemming, free gift-wrapping, easy layaways, the Buckle private label credit card, and a guest loyalty program. Most stores are located in regional shopping malls and lifestyle centers, and this is the Company's strategy for future expansion. The majority of the Company's central office functions, including purchasing, pricing, accounting, advertising, and distribution, are controlled from its headquarters and distribution center in Kearney, Nebraska. The Company’s men’s buying team is located in Overland Park, Kansas.
Incorporated in Nebraska in 1948, the Company commenced business under the name Mills Clothing, Inc., a conventional men's clothing store with only one location. In 1967, a second store, under the trade name Brass Buckle, was purchased. In the early 1970s, the store image changed to that of a jeans store with a wide selection of denims and shirts. The first branch store was opened in Columbus, Nebraska, in 1976. In 1977, the Company began selling young women's apparel and opened its first mall store. The Company changed its corporate name to The Buckle, Inc. on April 23, 1991 and has experienced significant growth since that time, operating 450 stores in 42 states at the end of fiscal 2018. All references herein to fiscal 2018 refer to the 52-week period ended February 2, 2019. Fiscal 2017 refers to the 53-week period ended February 3, 2018, and fiscal 2016 refers to the 52-week period ended January 28, 2017. All references herein to the “Company”, “Buckle”, “we”, “us”, or similar terms refer to The Buckle, Inc. and its subsidiary.
The Company's principal executive offices are located at 2407 West 24th Street, Kearney, Nebraska 68845. The Company's telephone number is (308) 236-8491. The Company publishes its corporate web site at www.buckle.com.

Marketing and Merchandising
The Company's marketing and merchandising strategy is designed to create customer loyalty by offering a wide selection of key brand name and private label merchandise and providing a broad range of value-added services. The Company believes it provides a unique specialty apparel store experience with merchandise designed to appeal to the fashion-conscious 15 to 30-year old. The merchandise mix includes denims, casual bottoms, tops, sportswear, outerwear, accessories, and footwear. Denim is a significant contributor to total sales (41% of fiscal 2018 net sales) and is a key to the Company's merchandising strategy. The Company believes it attracts customers with its wide selection of branded and private label denim and a wide variety of fits, finishes, and styles. Tops are also significant contributors to total sales (32.8% of fiscal 2018 net sales). The Company strives to provide a continually changing selection of the latest casual fashions.

The percentage of net sales over the past three fiscal years of the Company's major product lines are set forth in the following table:

 | Fiscal Years Ended
Merchandise Group | February 2, 2019 | | February 3, 2018 | | January 28, 2017
Denims | 41.0 | % | | 41.5 | % | 42.2 | %
Tops (including sweaters) | 32.8 | | | 32.3 | | 30.8 | 
Accessories | 8.8 | | | 9.1 | | 9.2 | 
Footwear | 6.7 | | | 6.1 | | 5.9 | 
Sportswear/fashions | 6.0 | | | 6.2 | | 6.5 | 
Outerwear | 2.1 | | | 2.0 | | 2.0 | 
Casual bottoms | 1.2 | | | 1.3 | | 1.9 | 
Other | 1.4 | | | 1.5 | | 1.5 | 
Total | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %


Brand name merchandise accounted for approximately 62.5% of the Company's sales during fiscal 2018. The remaining balance is comprised of private label merchandise from exclusive brands including BKE, Buckle Black, BKE Boutique, Red by BKE, Daytrip denim, Gimmicks, Gilded Intent, FITZ + EDDI, Outpost Makers, Departwest, and Veece. The Company's merchandisers continually work with manufacturers and vendors to produce brand name merchandise, the majority of which they believe is exclusive in terms of color, style, and fit. While the brands offered by the Company change to meet current customer preferences, the Company currently offers denims from brands such as Miss Me, Rock Revival, KanCan, Flying Monkey, and Levi's. Other key brands include Hurley, Billabong, Affliction, American Fighter, Oakley, Fox, Puma, Obey, RVCA, Salvage, 7 Diamonds, Nixon, Free People, White Crow, Salt Life, Corral, Reef, Kustom, Timberland, UGG, SOREL, Hey Dude, Steve Madden, SAXX, Stance, Lokai, Ray-Ban, Fossil, and G-Shock. The Company expects that brand name merchandise will continue to constitute the majority of sales.
Management believes the Company provides a unique store environment by maintaining a high level of personalized service and by offering a wide selection of fashionable, quality merchandise. The Company believes it is essential to create an enjoyable shopping environment and, in order to fulfill this mission, it employs highly motivated employees who provide personal attention to customers. Each salesperson is educated to help create a complete look for the customer by helping them find the best fits and showing merchandise as coordinating outfits. The Company also incorporates specialized services such as free hemming, free gift wrapping, layaways, a guest loyalty program, the Buckle private label credit card, personalized stylist services, and a special order system that allows stores to obtain specifically requested merchandise from other Company stores or from the Company's online order fulfillment center. Customers are encouraged to use the Company's layaway plan, which allows customers to make a partial payment on merchandise that is then held by the store until the balance is paid. For the past three fiscal years, an average of between approximately 1.5% to 3.2% of net sales have been made on a layaway basis, which is recorded as revenue upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer.
Merchandising and pricing decisions are made centrally; however, the Company's distribution system allows for variation in the mix of merchandise distributed to each store. This allows individual store inventories to be tailored to reflect differences in customer buying patterns at various locations. In addition, to ensure a continually fresh look in its stores, the Company ships new merchandise daily to most stores. The Company also has a transfer program that shifts certain merchandise to locations where it is selling best. This distribution and transfer system helps to maintain customer satisfaction by providing in-stock popular items and reducing the need to markdown slow-moving merchandise at a particular location. The Company believes the reduced markdowns justify the incremental distribution costs associated with the transfer system. The Company does not hold store-wide off-price sales at any time.

The Company continually evaluates its store design as part of the overall shopping experience and feels its current design continues to be well received by both guests and developers. This store design contains warm wood fixtures and floors, real brick finishes, and an appealing ceiling and lighting layout that creates a comfortable environment for the guest to shop. The Company has been able to modify the store design for specialized venues including lifestyle centers and larger mall fronts. The signature Buckle-B icon and red color are used throughout the store on fixtures, graphic images, and print materials to reinforce the brand identity. To enhance selling and product presentation, the Company continues to update the fixtures in its stores. New tables and fixtures have been added to the Company’s signature store design in each of the last several fiscal years. The new tables and fixtures were also rolled out to certain existing stores to update their looks as well.
Marketing and Advertising
In fiscal 2018, the Company spent $10.7 million, or 1.2% of net sales, on seasonal marketing campaigns, advertising, promotions, online marketing, and in-store point-of-sale materials. Seasonal image and promotional signage is presented in store window displays and on merchandising presentations throughout the store to complement the product and reinforce the brand's image. Promotions such as sweepstakes, gift with purchase offers, and special events are offered to enhance the guest’s shopping experience. Seasonal image guides, featuring current fashion trends and product selection, are distributed in the stores, at special events, and in new markets. Buckle partners with key merchandise vendors on joint advertising and promotional opportunities that expand the marketing reach and position Buckle as the destination store for these specialty branded fashions. 
The Company also offers programs to build and strengthen its relationship with loyal guests. Two different programs work to achieve these goals. In fiscal 2016, the Company phased out its previous frequent shopper program (the Buckle Primo Card) and replaced it with an improved electronic loyalty program called Buckle Guest Loyalty. Both the former Buckle Primo Card and the new Buckle Guest Loyalty program are available to all guests who elect to participate and the rewards structure for both programs is similar. In addition, private label credit card guests receive even more benefits when they use their Buckle Card. The B-Rewards incentive program rewards loyal cardholders with a B-Rewards gift card at the end of each rewards period and invites them back into the store. The Company extends other exclusive benefits to active Buckle cardholders such as special bonus B-Rewards periods, targeted mailings, and exclusive gift with purchase offers. The Company provides special Buckle Black and Buckle Exclusive cardholder programs for its most loyal Buckle Card guests. Buckle Black cardholders must purchase at least $500 and Buckle Exclusive cardholders must spend at least $1,000 annually. These guests receive exclusively designed cards and enjoy additional benefits including free ground shipping on special orders and online purchases, as well as extended B-Reward redemption periods. The Buckle Card marketing program is partially funded by Comenity Bank, a third-party bank that owns the Buckle Card accounts.
The Company publishes a corporate web site at www.buckle.com. The Company’s web site serves as a second retail touch-point for cross-channel marketing, reaching a growing online audience. Buckle.com is an e-Commerce enabled channel with an interactive, informative, and brand building environment where guests can shop, enter sweepstakes, fill out a wish list, find out about career opportunities, and read the Company’s latest financial news. The Company maintains an opt-in email database. Targeted email campaigns are sent notifying guests of the latest promotions and product offerings. Search engine and affiliate marketing programs are managed to increase online and in-store traffic as well as conversion rates. Buckle’s online store was launched April 26, 1999 as a marketing tool, to extend the Company’s brand beyond the physical locations. The Company launched a completely redesigned Buckle.com on a new e-Commerce platform on June 8, 2016. The new site provided several updates and enhancements designed to improve both the performance of the site and the overall shopping experience.
Store Operations
The Company has an Executive Vice President of Stores, a Vice President of Sales, an Associate Vice President of Sales, 2 Directors of Sales, 4 Regional Managers, 23 District Managers, and 85 Area Managers. Certain district managers and all area managers also serve as manager of their home base store. In general, each store has 1 manager, 1 or 2 assistant managers, 1 to 3 additional full-time salespeople, and up to 20 part-time salespeople. Most stores have peak levels of staff during the back-to-school and Christmas seasons. Almost every location also employs an alterations person.

The Company places great importance on educating quality personnel. In addition to sharing career opportunities with current Buckle employees, the Company also recruits interns and management trainees from college campuses. A majority of the Company’s store managers, all of its area and district managers, and most of its executive management team are former salespeople, including President and CEO, Dennis H. Nelson, and Chairman, Daniel J. Hirschfeld. Recognizing talent and promoting managers from within allows the Company to build a strong foundation for management. 
Store managers receive compensation in the form of a base salary and incentive bonuses. District and area managers also receive added incentives based upon the performance of stores in their district/area. Store managers perform sales training for new employees at the store level. 
The Company has established a comprehensive program stressing the prevention and control of shrinkage losses. Steps taken to reduce shrinkage include monitoring returns, cash refunds, voids, inappropriate discounts, and employee sales. The Company also has electronic article surveillance systems in all of the Company’s stores as well as surveillance camera systems in approximately 99% of the stores. As a result, the Company achieved a merchandise shrinkage rate of 0.5% of net sales in fiscal year 2018 and 0.6% of net sales in both fiscal years 2017 and 2016.
The average store is approximately 5,100 square feet (of which the Company estimates an average of approximately 80% is selling space), and stores range in size from 2,900 square feet to 8,475 square feet.
Purchasing and Distribution
The Company has an experienced buying team. The buying team is led by the Vice President of Women’s Merchandising and Senior Vice President of Men’s Merchandising, who have over 50 years of combined experience with the Company. The experience and leadership within the buying team contributes significantly to the Company’s success by enabling the buying team to react quickly to changes in fashion and by providing extensive knowledge of sources for both branded and private label goods. 
The Company purchases products from manufacturers within the United States as well as from agents who source goods from foreign manufacturers. The Company's merchandising team shops and monitors fashion to stay abreast of the latest trends. The Company continually monitors styles, quality, and delivery schedules. The Company has not experienced any material difficulties with merchandise manufactured in foreign countries. The Company does not have long-term or exclusive contracts with any brand name manufacturer, private label manufacturer, or supplier. The Company plans its private label production with private label vendors three to six months in advance of product delivery. The Company requires its vendors to sign and adhere to its Code of Conduct and Standards of Engagement, which addresses adherence to legal requirements regarding employment practices and health, safety, and environmental regulations.
In fiscal 2018, Miss Me/Rock Revival accounted for 15.8% of the Company’s net sales and Axis Denim (which produces private label denim for the Company) accounted for 15.0% of net sales. No other vendor accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales. Other current significant vendors include KanCan, Flying Monkey, Levi's, Hurley, Billabong, Affliction, American Fighter, Oakley, Fox, Puma, Obey, RVCA, Salvage, 7 Diamonds, Nixon, Free People, White Crow, Salt Life, Corral, Reef, Kustom, Timberland, UGG, SOREL, Hey Dude, Steve Madden, SAXX, Stance, Lokai, Ray-Ban, Fossil, and G-Shock. The Company continually strives to offer brands that are currently popular with its customers and, therefore, the Company's suppliers and purchases from specific vendors may vary significantly from year to year.
Buckle stores generally carry the same merchandise, with quantity and seasonal variations based upon historical sales data, climate, and perceived local customer demand. The Company uses a centralized receiving and distribution center located in Kearney, Nebraska. Merchandise is received daily in Kearney where it is sorted, tagged with bar-coded tickets (unless the vendor UPC code is used or the merchandise is pre-ticketed), and packaged for distribution to individual stores primarily via FedEx. The Company's goal is to ship the majority of its merchandise out to the stores within one to two business days of receipt. This system allows stores to receive new merchandise almost daily, creating excitement within the store and providing customers with a reason to shop often. 
The Company has developed an effective computerized system for tracking merchandise from the time it is checked in at the Company's distribution center until it arrives at the stores and is sold to a customer. The system's function is to ensure that store shipments are delivered accurately and promptly, to account for inventory, and to assist in allocating merchandise among stores. Management can track, on a daily basis, which merchandise is selling at specific locations and direct transfers of merchandise from one store to another as necessary. This allows stores to carry a reduced inventory while at the same time satisfying customer demand.

To reduce inter-store shipping costs and provide timely restocking of in-season merchandise, the Company warehouses a portion of initial shipments for later distribution. Sales reports are then used to replenish, on a basis of one to three times each week, those stores that are experiencing the greatest success selling specific styles, colors, and sizes of merchandise. This system is also designed to prevent an over-crowded look in the stores at the beginning of a season. 
During fiscal 2010, the Company completed construction of a new 240,000 square foot distribution center in Kearney, Nebraska. The Company transitioned to the new distribution center in September 2010 and the new facility is currently the Company’s only operating store distribution center. The Company also owns two additional facilities as part of its home office campus in Kearney, Nebraska (one of which was was completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2015). These facilities serve as the Company's corporate headquarters and house its online fulfillment and customer service center. 
Store Locations and Expansion Strategies
As of March 29, 2019, the Company operated 450 stores in 42 states. The existing stores are in 3 downtown locations, 14 strip centers, 57 lifestyle centers, and 376 shopping malls. The Company anticipates opening one new store in fiscal 2019. The following table lists the location of existing stores as of March 29, 2019:

Location of Stores
State | Number of Stores | State | Number of Stores | State | Number of Stores
Alabama | 7 | Maryland | 2 | Oregon | 6 
Alaska | 1 | Michigan | 18 | Pennsylvania | 9 
Arizona | 12 | Minnesota | 12 | South Carolina | 4

Over the past ten years, Buckle has grown its number of stores from 387 at the beginning of fiscal 2009 to 450 at the end of fiscal 2018. The Company intends to open new stores only when management believes there is a reasonable expectation of satisfactory results.
The following table sets forth information regarding store openings and closings from the beginning of fiscal 2009 through the end of fiscal 2018:

Total Number of Stores Per Year
Fiscal Year | Open at start of year | Opened in Current Year | Closed in Current Year | Open at end of year
2009 | 387 | 20 | 6 | 401 
2010 | 401 | 21 | 2 | 420 
2011 | 420 | 13 | 2 | 431 
2012 | 431 | 10 | 1 | 440 
2013 | 440 | 13 | 3 | 450 
2014 | 450 | 16 | 6 | 460 
2015 | 460 | 9 | 1 | 468 
2016 | 468 | 5 | 6 | 467 
2017 | 467 | 2 | 12 | 457 
2018 | 457 | — | 7 | 450 

The Company's criteria used when considering a particular location for expansion include: 

• | Market area, including proximity to existing markets to capitalize on name recognition;


• | Trade area population (number, average age, and college population);


• | Economic vitality of market area;


• | Mall location, anchor tenants, tenant mix, and average sales per square foot;


• | Available location within a mall, square footage, storefront width, and facility of using the current store design;


• | Availability of experienced management personnel for the market;


• | Cost of rent, including minimum rent, common area, and extra charges;


• | Estimated construction costs, including landlord charge backs and tenant allowances.

The Company generally seeks sites of 4,250 to 5,000 square feet for its stores. The projected cost of opening a store is approximately $1.0 million, including construction costs of approximately $0.8 million (prior to any construction allowance received) and inventory costs of approximately $0.2 million, net of accounts payable.
The Company anticipates opening one new store during fiscal 2019 and expects to complete approximately three full remodels. The construction costs for a full remodel are comparable to those of a new store. The Company also plans to complete several smaller store remodeling projects during fiscal 2019. The Company anticipates capital spending of approximately $8.0 to $12.0 million during fiscal 2019, which includes primarily planned store projects and technology investments.
The Company's ability to expand in the future will depend, in part, on general business conditions, the ability to find suitable malls with acceptable sites on satisfactory terms, and the readiness of trained store managers. There can be no assurance that the Company's future expansion plans will be fulfilled in whole or in part, or that leases for potential new sites will be obtained on terms favorable to the Company.

Management Information Systems
The Company's management information systems ("MIS") and electronic data processing systems ("EDP") consist of a full range of retail, financial, and merchandising systems, including purchasing, inventory distribution and control, sales reporting, accounts payable, and merchandise management.
The system includes PC based point-of-sale ("POS") registers in each store. The registers trickle transactions to a central server using a virtual private network for collection of comprehensive data, including complete item-level sales information and employee time clocking. The transactions are then swept into the central computer (IBM iSeries). Price updates are sent daily for the price lookup (“PLU”) file maintained within the POS registers. 
Each weekday morning, the Company initiates an electronic "sweep" of the individual store bank accounts to the Company's primary concentration account. This allows the Company to meet its obligations and invest cash on a timely basis.

Management monitors the performance of each of its stores on a continual basis. Daily information is used to evaluate inventory, determine markdowns, analyze profitability, and assist management in the scheduling and compensation of employees. 
The PLU system allows management to control merchandise pricing centrally, permitting faster and more accurate processing of sales at the store and the monitoring of specific inventory items to confirm that centralized pricing decisions are carried out in each of the stores. Management is able to direct all price changes, including promotional, clearance, and markdowns on a central basis and estimate the financial impact of such changes.
The virtual private network for communication with the stores also supports the Company’s intranet site. The intranet allows stores to view various types of information from the corporate office. Stores also have access to a variety of tools such as a product search with pictures, product availability, special order functions, inventory management, scheduling, performance tracking, printable forms, links to transmit various requests and information to the corporate office, training videos, email, and information/guidelines from each of the departments at the corporate office. The Company’s network is also structured so that it can support additional functionality such as digital video monitoring and digital music content programming at each store location.
The Company is committed to the ongoing review of its MIS and EDP systems to maintain productive, timely information and effective controls. This review includes testing of new products and systems to ensure that the Company is aware of technological developments. Most important, continual feedback is sought from every level of the Company to ensure that information provided is pertinent to all aspects of the Company's operations. 
Employees
As of February 2, 2019, the Company had approximately 7,400 employees - approximately 3,000 of whom were full-time. The Company has an experienced management team and most of the management team, from store managers through senior management, began work for the Company on the sales floor. The Company experiences high turnover of store and distribution center employees, primarily due to the number of part-time employees. However, the Company has not experienced significant difficulty in hiring qualified personnel. Of the total employees, approximately 800 are employed at the corporate headquarters and in the distribution center. None of the Company's employees are represented by a union. Management believes that employee relations are good. 
Competition
The men's and women's apparel industries are highly competitive with fashion, selection, quality, price, location, store environment, and service being the principal competitive factors. While the Company believes it is able to compete favorably with other merchandisers, including department stores and specialty retailers, with respect to each of these factors, the Company believes it competes mainly on the basis of customer service and merchandise selection.
In the men's merchandise area, the Company competes primarily with specialty retailers such as Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters, Gap, H&M, Hollister, Pacific Sunwear, Scheels, Tilly’s, Urban Outfitters, and Zumiez. The men's market also competes with certain department stores, such as Dillards, Macy’s, Nordstrom, and certain local or regional department stores and small specialty stores, as well as with mail order and internet retailers.
9

In the women's merchandise area, the Company competes primarily with specialty retailers such as Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters, Express, Forever 21, Gap, H&M, Hollister, Maurices, Pacific Sunwear, Scheels, Tilly's, Urban Outfitters, and Zumiez. The women's market also competes with department stores, such as Dillards, Macy’s, Nordstrom, and certain local or regional department stores and small specialty stores (such as women's clothing boutiques), as well as with mail order and internet retailers.
Many of the Company's competitors are considerably larger and have substantially greater financial, marketing, and other resources than the Company, and there is no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully with them in the future. Furthermore, while the Company believes it competes effectively for favorable site locations and lease terms, competition for prime locations within a mall is intense.
Seasonality
The Company's business is seasonal, with the holiday season (from approximately November 15 to December 30) and the back-to-school season (from approximately July 15 to September 1) historically contributing the greatest volume of net sales. For fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, the holiday and back-to-school seasons accounted for approximately 35% of the Company's fiscal year net sales.
