We are currently in the process of building out manufacturing capacity at our corporate headquarters. Our long-term target is to onshore the manufacturing of most of our components and assemblies, including cell manufacturing, to the United States.
 Our main target markets are currently the RV & Marine industry. We believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the rapid market conversion from lead-acid to lithium batteries as the primary method of power sourcing in these industries. Additional focus markets include home energy storage, where we aim to provide a cost-effective, low barrier of entry, and a do-it-yourself (“DIY”) flexible system for those looking to power their homes via solar energy, wind, or grid back-up. Along with RV/Marine and home energy storage markets, we aim to provide additional capacities to the ever-expanding electric forklift and industrial material handling markets.
 Expion360’s e360 product line, which is manufactured for the RV/Marine industry, was launched in December 2020. The e360 product line, through its rapid sales growth, has shown to be a preferred conversion solution for lead-acid batteries. We believe that our e360 Home Energy Storage system has strong revenue potential with recurring income opportunities for us and our associated sales partners.
 Our products provide numerous advantages for various industries that are looking to migrate to lithium-based energy storage. They incorporate detailed-oriented design and engineering and strong case materials and internal and structural layouts, and are backed by responsive customer service.
  Our Market Opportunity
 The trend of vehicle electrification is expected to be a significant growth catalyst for lithium compounds over the next decade and beyond. According to industry sources and management estimates, the global electric vehicle market was valued at $163.01 billion in 2020, and is projected to reach $823.75 billion by 2030, a CAGR of 18.2%. In addition, the North American electric vehicle market is projected to reach $147.6 billion by 2028, a CAGR of 37.2%.
  Furthermore, the North American RV market was estimated at roughly $33.95 billion in 2021, and is expected to grow at a 9.7% CAGR, approaching $59.16 billion by 2027. There are almost 230 national chain RV dealers in the United States, further exemplifying the robust market for these vehicles. In addition, the global recreational boating market was valued at $27.32 billion in 2021, and is projected to reach $36.78 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 5.1% from 2021 to 2027.
  At the intersection of both these trends lies the rapidly expanding lithium battery market. The market for lithium-ion batteries is expected to grow at 13.1% CAGR between 2022 and 2031, from roughly $44.5 billion to $135.1 billion. The vast expansion of the lithium battery market can be attributed to global trends promoting clean energy, as well as the compact and flexible nature of lithium battery packs which make them easy to install in RV’s and boats. Our technology, which we believe offers industry leading battery pack flexibility for the most efficient energy storage, is poised to be able to offer power to these large vehicles such as RV’s and recreational boats.

 Expion360 is focused on expanding its position in the deep cycle, off-grid and stationary energy storage markets. According to the Federal Consortium for Advanced Batteries, the United States has five goals in mind to secure battery materials and the U.S. technology supply chain. They include (1) securing access to raw materials; (2) support of the U.S. materials-processing base; (3) stimulation of U.S. electrode, cell, and pack manufacturing; (4) enabling recycling and reuse of critical materials; and (5) support of scientific R&D, STEM education and workforce development. Expion360 is well positioned to benefit from this national focus.
 The Biden Administration has also laid out a bold agenda to address the climate crisis and build a clean and equitable energy economy that achieves carbon-pollution-free electricity by 2035 and puts the United States on a path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide. We believe this government support will continue to drive rapid growth in the industry.
  Lithium-based batteries power our daily lives, from consumer electronics to national defense. They enable electrification of the transportation sector and provide stationary grid storage, critical to developing the clean-energy economy. The U.S. has a strong research community, a robust innovation infrastructure for technological advancement of batteries, and an emerging lithium-based battery manufacturing industry, according to the US Department of Energy.
  It is our desire to work closely with federal, state and local governments, as well as private industry to help America be the leader in lithium battery technology.
 Competitive Strengths 
 We believe the following strengths differentiate Expion360 and create long-term, sustainable competitive advantages:
  Superior Capacity to Lead Acid Competitors
  Lead-acid batteries have always been the standard in RV and marine transportation vehicles. Our lithium-ion batteries offer superior capacity to our lead-acid competitors. Our batteries utilize lithium iron phosphate, and therefore, are expected to have a lifespan of approximately 12 years — three to four times that of certain lead-acid batteries and with ten times the number of charging cycles. Furthermore, we believe that our typical battery provides three times the power of the typical, lead-acid battery despite being half the weight (comparing, for example, a typical lead-acid battery like Renogy Deep Cycle AGM, which is rated at 100Ah, to our own LFP 100Ah battery and assuming slow discharge at a .1C rate).
 Battery Pack Flexibility
  Our battery packs are also highly flexible, designed to be moved and used in various applications seamlessly. We plan to onshore our semi-automated pack assembly in Redmond, Oregon. The initial equipment has arrived and subject to market conditions, we are working on setup and development of additional equipment to automate the line. This should allow us to use a more flexible approach to forming and creating new battery packs. By onshoring, we expect to be able to react to market demands at a much quicker pace and increase profit levels over our competition. 
 Long-time RV and Marine Industry Experience and Relationships and Strong Insider Ownership
   Expion360 is managed by a team with a strong track record in the RV and clean energy spaces. John Yozamp, Founder of Expion360, pioneered multiple new recreational concepts in the RV industry. As the founder and previous owner of Zamp Solar, he has extensive relationships in the RV OEM industry. In addition, our co-founders own significant equity in the company, signaling a strong commitment and personal investment.

 Expansion into New Markets
  While RV and marine applications currently drive revenue, Expion360 has plans to expand into the home energy market in the coming years. Our e360 Home Energy Storage system is planned to target entry level customers with its modular design that will allow for DIY expansion. We see the vision of stored energy as a portable, moving concept, where stored energy can be transported from the home to other devices outside of it. Furthermore, Expion360 plans to file for IP protection for Expion360’s “Smart Talk” upon completion of development. “Smart Talk” is designed to allow multiple batteries in a bank to communicate as one and be linked to a network.
 In furtherance of our vision of stored energy, in January 2023, Expion360 introduced two portable power generator products: the AURA POWERCAP™ 600 and AURA POWERCAP™ 800 (together, the “Aura”). The AURA POWERCAP™ 600 is designed to fit and convert any one of Expion360’s group 24 lithium batteries into a 600W mobile power station while the AURA POWERCAP™ 800 is designed to fit and convert any one of Expion360’s group 27 lithium batteries into an 800W mobile power station. The Aura’s proprietary patent pending design allows the AURA POWERCAP™ 600 to join seamlessly to 60Ah, 80Ah, and 95Ah Expion360 batteries and the AURA POWERCAP™ 800 to join to 100Ah and 120Ah Expion360 batteries. The AURA POWERCAP™ 600 and AURA POWERCAP™ 800 are an exclusive fit to Expion360 batteries and will not fit other brands. The AURA POWERCAP™ 600 and AURA POWERCAP™ 800 contain beneficial features and functions for a compact portable power unit, including the ability to recharge the battery from the input charge port using the included 7 Amp household charger and the ability to recharge remotely with Expion360’s lightweight portable solar panel options, which are sold separately.
 Strong National Retail Customers and Distribution Channels
  Expion360 has sales relationships with many major RV retailers and with marine retailers and plans to use what we believe is a strong reputation in the lithium battery space to create an even stronger distribution channel. John Yozamp has used his decades of experience in the energy and RV industries to cultivate relationships with numerous retailers in the space. Expion360 has already established a sales relationship with several large retail customers, including Camping World, a leading national RV retailer, as well as NTP-STAG, a leading distributor of aftermarket RV parts.
Product Section
 
We focus on the design, assembly, and sales of lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries and supporting accessories for RV and marine applications. Our batteries are designed and engineered in house using premium lithium iron phosphate cells with quality controls at every step We use high-grade LiFePO4 encased in steel and meeting the UL 1642 standard (UL file no. MH64383). We believe that our materials and engineering enhance the reliability, stability, and safety of our products. We reimagined the standard battery case and included built-in rubber feet, radiused corners, 96.7% larger terminal connection pads, interior molded ribs for structural security, and the highest-grade ABS plastics with additives for fire retardancy. To maximize the power and efficiency of our batteries, we welded our cells via thick copper/tin machined collector plates, welded all interior pack points, added a press broke flange at each end to create a mechanical backbone for the battery monitoring system (the “BMS”), used high-grade wiring and ring terminals throughout, and treated connections with industrial epoxy for long-lasting protection. Our internal “smart” BMS design includes multiple safety and performance features, such as: low temperature discharge, auto shutoff, short circuit protection, low- and high-voltage shutoffs, and overcurrent disconnect. Our structurally sound BMS board features a bolted design, eliminating all unnecessary solder, resulting in one cohesive pack with a long lifespan. We hold our lithium batteries to high safety standards, which has enabled us to achieve a UL 1973 compliance. We stand by our batteries with an industry leading 12-year warranty.
 
To enable us to provide a full range of components to complement our battery offerings, we offer a suite of accessories and components for new installations or conversions which includes but is not limited to chargers, monitors, inverters, and solar components from brands such as Victron Energy and RedArc.

Competitors
 
Our competitors include lithium-ion battery manufacturers, such as Relion (which was acquired by Brunswick Corporation in September 2021), Battle Born Batteries, Renogy, and Dakota Lithium. Lead-acid battery manufactures also continue to have a presence in the marketplace. We have designed custom form factors in both the industry standard Group 24 and Group 27 battery sizes allowing us to visually and structurally differentiate Expion360 within the market space. We believe that our custom 360Ah battery also provides a unique capacity to footprint ratio compared to lead-acid and lithium battery competitors. Our batteries utilize lithium iron phosphate, and therefore, are expected to have a lifespan of approximately 12 years — three to four times that of certain lead-acid batteries and with ten times the number of charging cycles. Furthermore, we believe that our typical battery provides three times the power of the typical, lead-acid battery despite being half the weight (comparing, for example, a typical lead-acid battery like Renogy Deep Cycle AGM, which is rated at 100Ah, to our own LFP 100Ah battery and assuming slow discharge at a .1C rate).
 Manufacturing and Supply Chain
 Our batteries are manufactured by multiple third-party manufacturers located in China who also produce our battery cells. We then assemble and package the batteries in the United States for sale to our customers. While we do not have long-term purchase agreements with our third-party manufacturers and our purchases are completed on a purchase order basis, we have had strong relationships with our third-party manufacturers spanning many years. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 85% and 90%, respectively, of inventory purchases were made from foreign suppliers in China and Hong Kong. Our third-party manufacturers source the raw materials and battery components required for the production of our batteries directly from third-party suppliers that meet our approval and quality standards and as a result, we may have limited control over the agreed pricing for these raw materials and battery components. Our battery cell manufacturers also have joint venture factories outside of China and have secured sourcing contracts from lithium suppliers in South America and Australia. In addition, the Company has secured a secondary source for lithium iron phosphate cells used in its batteries from a supplier in Denmark, enabling the Company to source materials outside of China in the event it becomes necessary to do so. We aim to maintain an appropriate level of inventory to satisfy our expected supply requirements. We believe that we could locate alternative third-party manufacturers to fulfill our needs.

Lithium is a key raw material used to produce our battery cells and as a result, the cost of our battery cells is dependent on the price and availability of lithium. From 2010 until 2015, the price of lithium stayed fairly flat. In 2016 the price started to rise, fueled by the fear of material shortages. As a result of the higher prices, new mining operations that had been in development came online and companies invested in more efficient extraction processes. The increases in production led to an oversupply of lithium in 2019 and a sharp drop in prices. The lithium prices in 2020 ended below the 2016 prices.
 In addition to increased mining and newly located reserves, there is also an industry push to provide more efficient ways to extract lithium from the mined ore. Another development of the past few years is lithium cell recycling. This process will recapture the raw lithium from the cell for reuse in future cells. The price of lithium remains subject to volatility and thus we aim to monitor any developments that might adversely affect our supply chain.
 Customers
 We currently have over 213 customers across the United States consisting of dealers, wholesalers, private-label customers and original equipment manufacturers who then sell our products to end consumers. Our sales are completed on a purchase order basis and most are without firm, long-term revenue commitments or sales arrangements. In addition, we also sell products directly to consumers. Expion360 has sales relationships with many major RV retailers, including Camping World, a leading national RV retailer, as well as NTP-STAG, a leading distributor of aftermarket RV parts as well as with marine retailers. In December 2022, we were selected as the exclusive supplier of lithium-ion batteries for an overland trailer to be branded and sold by a top U.S. sports utility vehicle manufacturer. Due to the progress and success with our existing sales and distribution activities and to avoid any channel conflicts, our previously announced value-added reseller program has been deferred, pending additional review. We will continue to focus on our sales and distribution channels in order to develop existing customer relationships and grow our customer base.We also offer a high level of technical support to our customers before and after product sales.
 We currently derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers. During the year ended December 31, 2022, sales to our top three customers totaled $2,905,326, comprising approximately 41% of our total sales, including sales to one customer, which totaled $1,346,344 or approximately 19% of our total sales.
 Intellectual Property
 The success of our business and our technology leadership is supported by our proprietary battery technology. We have filed patent applications in the United States to provide protection for our technology. Two design patents in the United States related to the new AURA POWERCAP™ are pending as of December 2022. In addition, we rely upon a combination of trademark and trade secret laws in the United States, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections, to establish, maintain and enforce rights in our proprietary technologies. We also seek to protect our intellectual property rights through non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and through non-disclosure agreements with business partners and other third parties.
 We periodically review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our domain names and trademarks and service marks in the United States and in an effort to protect our brand, as of December 31, 2022, we own 5 trademark registrations to cover our house marks in the United States and we have 3 pending trademark applications relating to our design logos and slogans in the United States.
  Government Regulation
 We are subject to inspections by federal, state, and local regulators overseeing environmental health and safety, which could result in possible citations and/or fines. Lithium-ion battery shipments are categorized as “dangerous goods” and are subject to rules governing their transportation. We have implemented policies and procedures, trained our employees, and conducted internal audits to verify compliance with environmental health and safety regulations.

In August of 2022, our Group 24 and Group 27 batteries passed UL 1973 certification. In February 2023, our custom 360Ah battery also passed UL 1973 certification.
  Employees
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 25 employees, all full time. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we have never experienced an organized work stoppage, strike, or labor dispute. We believe working conditions and compensation packages are competitive with those offered by competitors and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company and a Smaller Reporting Company
  We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we have elected to take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

· | the requirement that we provide only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | an exemption from the requirement that we hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We may take advantage of these exemptions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company on the date that is the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.235 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.
 We are also a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.
