Overview 
Arlo Technologies, Inc. (“we”, “Arlo” or the “Company”) combines an intelligent cloud infrastructure and mobile app with a variety of smart connected devices that transform the way people experience the connected lifestyle. Our cloud-based platform creates a seamless, end-to-end connected lifestyle solution that provides users visibility, insight and a powerful means to help protect and connect with the people and things that matter most to them. Arlo enables users to monitor their environments and engage in real-time with their families and businesses from any location with a Wi-Fi or a cellular network internet connection. To date, we have launched several categories of award-winning smart connected devices, including wire-free smart Wi-Fi and LTE-enabled cameras, advanced baby monitors, smart security lights, and an audio doorbell that works in conjunction with Arlo Cameras. In addition, Arlo’s broad compatibility allows the platform to seamlessly integrate with third-party internet-of-things (“IoT”) products and protocols, such as Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Apple TV, Google Assistant, IFTTT, Stringify and Samsung SmartThings. Since the launch of our first product in December 2014, we have shipped over 11.7 million smart connected devices, and, as of December 31, 2018, our smart platform had approximately 2.85 million cumulative registered users across more than 100 countries around the world. We plan to continue to introduce new smart connected devices to the Arlo platform in new categories, increase the number of registered users on our platform, keep them highly engaged through our mobile app and generate incremental recurring revenue by offering them paid subscription services.

On February 6, 2018, NETGEAR, Inc., Arlo’s former parent company (“NETGEAR”), announced that its board of directors had unanimously approved the pursuit of a separation of its Arlo business from NETGEAR (the “Separation”) to be effected through an initial public offering (the “IPO”) of newly issued shares of the common stock of Arlo Technologies, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of NETGEAR. On August 2, 2018, NETGEAR and Arlo announced the pricing of the IPO of 10,215,000 shares of Arlo’s common stock at a price to the public of $16.00 per share. On August 3, 2018, Arlo’s shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “ARLO.” On August 7, 2018, we completed the IPO of 11,747,250 shares of common stock (including 1,532,250 shares of common stock pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, which was exercised in full on August 3, 2018), at $16.00 per share, before underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs and NETGEAR owned approximately 84.2% of the shares of Arlo’s outstanding common stock.
On November 29, 2018, NETGEAR announced that its board of directors had approved a special stock dividend (the “Distribution”) to NETGEAR stockholders of the 62,500,000 shares of Arlo common stock owned by NETGEAR, representing approximately 84.2% of the outstanding shares of Arlo common stock. 
The Distribution was made on December 31, 2018 (the “Distribution Date”) to all NETGEAR stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 17, 2018 (the “Record Date”). In the Distribution, each NETGEAR stockholder of record on the Record Date received 1.980295 shares of Arlo common stock for every share of NETGEAR common stock held on the Record Date, subject to cash in lieu of fractional shares. The Distribution was intended to qualify as generally tax free to NETGEAR stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Market
Our total addressable market consists of individuals and business owners who use connected devices to enhance their lives. Outside of the home, we have seen adoption of our cellular-enabled products in a variety of use cases, such as neighborhood watch, construction site monitoring, wildlife and outdoor trail surveillance and event monitoring. We believe the small business and government segments represent additional growth areas for us. We also believe we are well-positioned to extend our current market leadership to the broader connected lifestyle market both within and beyond the home as we continue to launch new product lines and services within our connected lifestyle platform. 
Products

Arlo Chime plugs into any standard wall outlet and pairs with the Arlo Audio Doorbell to play a variety of ringtones or act as a siren, and even contains a silent mode for those times when users don’t want to be bothered. The Arlo Audio Doorbell runs on two standard AA batteries which can last up to an entire year based on normal usage and features a weather-resistant exterior finish. For added ease and versatility, users also have the option to connect with their existing door chimes without needing to install any additional hardware or wiring. 
Arlo Accessories 

Arlo Charging Accessories are designed to offer additional convenient ways to keep Arlo wire-free cameras up and running even longer. With the Arlo Charging Station, users can charge up to two Arlo Pro, Arlo Pro 2 or Arlo Go batteries with fast-charging technology so there is always a battery ready to go. For those looking to eliminate battery swaps entirely, the mountable and weather-resistant Arlo Solar Panel connects to Arlo Pro or Arlo Go cameras to keep batteries charged with just a few hours of direct sunlight.

Arlo Mounts feature innovative designs that allow users to mount their cameras outdoors or indoors, on ceilings or countertops. The Arlo Quadpod is a flexible mount featuring four legs crafted from flexible stainless steel and silicone that allows users to mount their camera even in challenging spots such as tree branches or metal poles.
Arlo Skins allow Arlo owners to customize their Arlo cameras to blend into their environments or add a pop of personality. Popular with outdoor enthusiasts, Arlo Camouflage and Ghillie skins are ultraviolet- and water-resistant and made of durable silicone material for easy slip-on, slip-off convenience. Arlo Baby accessory characters add some playfulness to the nursery with fun disguises that turn Arlo Baby cameras into puppies, kittens or bunnies.

The Arlo App 
The Arlo app, available for iOS and Android devices, is designed to provide our users with an easy-to-use, flexible, mobile-first experience that connects our users to the people and things that matter most to them. Our proprietary AI-based capabilities generate relevant and actionable real-time notifications, which enable users to live stream video or contact emergency services through the app notifications when Arlo devices detect motion or sound. The Arlo app also enables users to view their library of video clips and share them via text, email or social networks. The app has three main navigating areas: devices, library, and setting and modes. 
Services 
Our prepaid service, included with the sale of our cameras, provides users with rolling seven-day cloud video storage, the ability to connect up to five cameras and 90 days of customer support. 
Launched in 2018, Arlo Smart is a paid subscription service that adds powerful AI capabilities to our cameras that enhance the user experience. Arlo Smart incorporates and replaces our legacy paid subscription services. Through real-time computer vision algorithms, Arlo Smart provides users a more personalized experience, deeper insights into detected activity and streamlined access to take responsive actions in urgent situations, such as contacting local emergency services. Arlo’s paid services subscriber base has grown from over 30,000 subscribers as of December 31, 2016 to about 144,000 subscribers as of December 31, 2018. 
Sales Channels 
We sell our products through multiple sales channels worldwide, including traditional and online retailers, wholesale distributors, broadcast channels and wireless carriers. 
Retailers. We sell to traditional and online retailers, either directly or through wholesale distributors. We work directly with our retail channels on market development activities, such as co-advertising, including digital and traditional media, online promotions and video demonstrations, instant rebate programs, event sponsorship and sales associate training. Our largest retailers include Best Buy, Costco, and Amazon and their affiliates. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we derived 24.4%, 17.5% and 16.6% of our revenue from Best Buy, Costco, and Amazon and their respective affiliates, respectively. 
Wholesale Distributors. Our distribution channel supplies our products to retailers, e-commerce resellers, wireless carriers and broadcast channels. We sell directly to our distributors, including Ingram Micro, Inc., D&H Distributing Company, Exertis (UK) Ltd. and Synnex Corporation. 
Broadcast Channels. We also sell our products through TV shopping networks such as HSN. 
Wireless Carriers. We supply our products to major wireless carriers around the world, including AT&T, Verizon, Telstra and Vodafone. This sales channel is and will continue to be the key route-to-market for our current portable LTE-enabled camera and any future cellular-enabled connected lifestyle devices.

Competition 
We believe we are well-positioned to extend our current market leadership to the broader connected lifestyle market, both within and beyond the home as we continue to launch new product lines and services within our smart platform. However, our market is highly competitive and evolving, and we expect competition to increase in the future. We believe the principal competitive factors impacting the market for our products include price, service offerings, functionality, brand, technology, design, distribution channels and customer service. 
We believe that we compete favorably in these areas on the basis of our market leadership position in the U.S. consumer network connected camera systems market, best-in-class technology, direct relationship with users and user engagement, trusted Arlo platform, strong Arlo brand and channel partners and deep strategic partnerships with key suppliers, such as Cypress Semiconductor Co., OmniVision Technologies Inc. and Qualcomm Incorporated. Moreover, our focus on building a connected lifestyle platform, combined with our leading market share in the consumer network connected camera systems market, has led to the strength of our Arlo brand worldwide. We believe this focus allows us to compete favorably with companies that have introduced or have announced plans to introduce devices with connected lifestyle functionalities. Nevertheless, the connected lifestyle market remains highly competitive, and has a multitude of participants, including: large global technology companies, such as Amazon (Ring and Blink) and Google (Nest); security service vendors, such as ADT; telecom service providers, such as AT&T and Comcast; and smaller point products companies. 
Many of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. We anticipate that current and potential competitors will also intensify their efforts to penetrate our target markets. For additional information, see “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, and to be competitive we may be required to lower our prices or increase our sales and marketing expenses, which could result in reduced margins and loss of market share.” 
Research and Development 
We are passionate about developing new and innovative products and services that enable the connected lifestyle. Our research and development team collaborates with our product team to design and build differentiated new products and improve upon our existing products and services. Our goal is to create unique user experiences within the connected lifestyle. For example, our original Arlo camera was the world’s first commercially available 100% battery-operated Wi-Fi security camera with 720p HD video, IP65-rated weather resistance and night vision. The groundbreaking nature of the product, first launched in December 2014, gathered critical acclaim and market success. Our research and development team has taken this same approach to all of our subsequent product releases, constantly innovating to stay ahead of the competition. 
As of December 31, 2018, our research and development staff consisted of 159 employees, located in our offices worldwide, and was comprised of front-end and back-end software engineers, RF engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, system test engineers, computer vision scientists and data analysis engineers, UX and industrial design engineers and mobile app developers. We intend to continue to significantly invest in research and development to expand our platform and capabilities in the future. 
Manufacturing
While all of our products are primarily designed in North America, we currently outsource manufacturing to Cloud Network Technology Singapore PTE. LTD., Pegatron Corporation, Sky Light Industrial Ltd. and Delta Networks, Inc., which are all headquartered in Asia. Although we do not have any long-term purchase contracts, we have executed master product supply agreements with these manufacturers, which typically provide indemnification for intellectual property infringement, epidemic failure clauses, agreed-upon price concessions, division of each party’s intellectual property and product quality requirements. Since we outsource our manufacturing, we have the flexibility and ability to 
7

adapt to market changes, product supply and component pricing while keeping our costs low. In addition to their responsibility for the manufacturing of our products, our manufacturers typically purchase all necessary parts and materials to produce finished goods. To maintain quality standards for our suppliers, we have established our own product quality organization based in Vietnam, Hong Kong, and mainland China, which is responsible for auditing and inspecting process and product quality on the premises of our manufacturers. Our strategic relationships with our manufacturers are an important component of our ability to introduce new products and grow our business.
We focus on driving alignment of our product roadmaps with our manufacturers and determining what we can do collectively to reduce costs across the supply chain. Our operations teams based in the United States, Hong Kong and mainland China coordinate with our manufacturers’ engineering, manufacturing and quality control personnel to develop the requisite manufacturing processes, quality checks and testing and general oversight of the manufacturing activities. We believe this model has enabled us to quickly and efficiently deliver high-quality and innovative products, while enabling us to minimize costs and manage inventory. 
Our products are manufactured and packaged for retail sale by our manufacturers mostly in Vietnam, with minimal manufacturers in China, and shipped to our logistics hubs located in the United States, the Netherlands, Hong Kong and Australia. Our operations team coordinates with our manufacturers to ensure that the shipment of our products from the manufacturers to these logistics hubs meets customer demand. 
Marketing 
Our marketing programs are focused on building global brand awareness, increasing product adoption and driving sales. Our marketing efforts target individuals interested in a connected lifestyle and we believe our marketing programs allow us to attract and engage with customers efficiently and at scale. We also increase brand awareness by augmenting word of mouth recommendations from Arlo customers and key influencers, interact digitally with current and prospective customers and maintain and develop our strong channel partnerships and large shelf space. We collaborate with our retail partners on market development activities to drive in-store and online engagement with the brand and drive purchases. 
Customer Care 
We provide customer care to Arlo users globally through a variety of communication channels, including phone, chat, email, social media and our Arlo Community, as well as self-guided resources such as knowledge-base articles, how-to videos and technical documentation on our website. We believe that providing timely, responsive customer support and educational content to our users helps foster an ongoing engagement that builds loyalty to our brand and also enables Arlo to understand user needs as they evolve. The online Arlo Community in particular serves as an efficient and engaging platform through which we can deliver customer care and receive feedback from users. We gather and analyze user feedback from all platforms to help inform our design and engineering teams about future enhancements to our products and services. 
In order to best serve our users globally, we manage and continually adjust our resources worldwide through a mixture of permanent employees and subcontracted, outsourced resources. As our installed base continues to grow in new geographies, new categories and technologies, we will continue to focus on building a scalable support infrastructure that enables our users to engage with us through the channel that is most convenient and efficient for their needs. 
IT Infrastructure Operations 
We currently serve our users from third-party data center hosting facilities. Our cloud platform runs in two data centers in the United States and a data center in Ireland to serve our European Union users. We also utilize one data center in each of China, Singapore and Australia. We have designed our cloud environments to be highly resilient with built-in redundancy and provide failover to other data centers in our network.

Fiscal periods 
Our fiscal year begins on January 1 of the year stated and ends on December 31 of the same year. We report our results on a fiscal quarter basis rather than on a calendar quarter basis. Under the fiscal quarter basis, each of the first three fiscal quarters ends on the Sunday closest to the calendar quarter end, with the fourth quarter ending on December 31. 
Seasonality
Historically, we have generated higher revenue in the third and fourth quarters of each year compared to the first and second quarters due to seasonal demand from consumer markets, primarily relating to the beginning of the school year and the holiday season. For example, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our third and fourth quarters collectively represented 54.5%, 62.0% and 65.5%, respectively, of our revenue for such years. Therefore, timely and effective product and service introductions are critical to our results of operations.
Backlog 
Our backlog consists of products for which customer purchase orders have been received and that are scheduled or in the process of being scheduled for shipment. As of December 31, 2018, we had a backlog of $18.9 million, compared to $15.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and $14.2 million as of December 31, 2016. As we typically fulfill orders received within a relatively short period (e.g., within one week for our top three customers) after receipt, our revenue in any fiscal year depends primarily upon orders booked and the availability of supply of our products in that year. In addition, most of our backlog is subject to rescheduling or cancellation with minimal penalties. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date may not be an indicator of revenue for any succeeding period. Similarly, there is a lack of meaningful correlation between year-over-year changes in backlog as compared with year-over-year changes in revenue. Accordingly, we do not believe that backlog information is material to an understanding of our overall business, and backlog as of any particular date should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.
Intellectual Property 
Our ability to protect our intellectual property will be an important factor in the success and continued growth of our business. We rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Some of our technology relies upon third-party licensed intellectual property. 
We currently hold 37 U.S.-issued patents, 36 pending U.S. patent applications, three patents issued by China and no pending patent applications outside of the United States relating to certain aspects of our hardware devices, accessories, software and services. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. 
We also pursue the registration of our domain names and trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. We currently have eight registered trademarks and three pending trademark applications in the United States, as well as 23 registered trademarks and 12 pending trademark applications outside of the United States. We currently hold trademark registrations for “ARLO” in seven countries, including the United States, as well as the European Union and the World Intellectual Property Organization. For more information, see “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-If we are unable to secure and protect our intellectual property rights, our ability to compete could be harmed.”

Environmental Laws 
Our products and manufacturing processes are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which cover both the use of various materials and environmental concerns. Environmental issues such as pollution and climate change have had significant legislative and regulatory efforts on a global basis, and there are expected to be additional changes to the regulations in these areas. These changes could directly increase the cost of energy, which may have an impact on the way we manufacture products. In addition, any new regulations or laws in the environmental area might increase the cost of the raw materials we use in our products and the cost of compliance. Other regulations in the environmental area may require us to continue to monitor and ensure proper disposal or recycling of our products. To the best of our knowledge, we maintain compliance with all current government regulations concerning our production processes for all locations in which we operate. Since we operate on a global basis, this is also a complex process that requires continual monitoring of regulations and an ongoing compliance process to ensure that we and our suppliers are in compliance with all existing regulations.
Our Culture and Our Employees 
Our culture, mission and core values are a critical part of our success. Our culture is built on a foundation that encourages creativity through entrepreneurship, diversity, empowerment, ethics and open dialogue to continually innovate and improve our technology, solutions, brand and partnerships. We continue to recruit and hire exceptionally talented, diverse and ethical employees and are proud of Arlo culture we have been able to build. We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees, and we have not experienced any labor disputes. As of December 31, 2018, we had 386 full-time employees.
