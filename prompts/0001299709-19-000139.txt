ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Axos Financial, Inc., is a financial holding company, a diversified financial services company with over $11.2 billion in assets that provides banking and securities products and services to its customers through its online and low-cost distribution channels and affinity partners. Axos Bank has deposit and loan customers nationwide including consumer and business checking, savings and time deposit accounts and financing for single family and multifamily residential properties, small-to-medium size businesses in target sectors, and selected specialty finance receivables. The Bank generates fee income from consumer and business products including fees from loans originated for sale and transaction fees earned from processing payment activity. Our securities products and services are offered through Axos Clearing LLC, formerly known as COR Clearing, LLC (“Axos Clearing”), acquired on January 28, 2019 and Axos Invest, Inc. (formally known as WiseBanyan, Inc.) (“Axos Invest”), acquired on February 26, 2019, which generate interest and fee income by providing comprehensive securities clearing services to introducing broker-dealers and registered investment advisor correspondents and digital investment advisory services to retail investors, respectively. Axos Clearing is a clearing broker-dealer registered with the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”). Axos Invest is a Registered Investment Advisor under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, that is registered with the SEC. WiseBanyan Securities LLC, an introducing broker-dealer that is registered with the SEC and FINRA was acquired together with Axos Invest on February 26, 2019. Axos Financial, Inc.’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is a component of the Russell 2000® Index and the S&P SmallCap 600® Index.
At June 30, 2019, we had total assets of $11,220.2 million, loans of $9,420.2 million, investment securities of $227.5 million, total deposits of $8,983.2 million and borrowings of $627.4 million. Because we do not incur the significantly higher fixed operating costs inherent in a branch-based distribution system, we are able to rapidly grow our deposits and assets by providing a better value to our customers and by expanding our low-cost distribution channels.
Our business strategy is to grow our loan and lease originations and our deposits to achieve increased economies of scale and reduce the cost of products and services to our customers by leveraging our distribution channels and technology. We have designed our online banking platform and our workflow processes to handle traditional banking functions with elimination of duplicate and unnecessary paperwork and human intervention. Our charter allows us to operate in all fifty states, and our online presence allows us increased flexibility to target a large number of loan and deposit customers based on demographics, geography and service needs. Our low-cost distribution channels provide opportunities to increase our core deposits and increase our loan originations by attracting new customers and developing new and innovative products and services. Our securities clearing and custody and digital wealth management platforms provide a comprehensive set of technology, clearing, cash management and lending services targeted at independent registered investment advisors and introducing broker-dealers, principals and clients of advisory firms and individuals not affiliated with an investment advisor. Our plan to integrate our clearing and wealth management platforms with our banking platform, will create an easy to use platform for customers banking and investing needs. Over time we expect our Securities Business to generate additional low-cost deposits, which would be available to fund the Banking Business.
Our long-term business plan includes the following principal objectives:

• | Maintain an annualized return on average common stockholders’ equity of 17.0% or better;


• | Annually increase average interest-earning assets by 12% or more; and


• | Maintain annualized efficiency ratio at the Bank to a level 40% or lower.

Segment Information
We operate through two operating segments: Banking Business and Securities Business.
The Banking Business includes a broad range of banking services including online banking, concierge banking, prepaid card services, and mortgage, vehicle and unsecured lending through online and telephonic distribution channels to serve the needs of consumers and small businesses nationally. In addition, the Banking Business focuses on providing deposit products nationwide to industry verticals (e.g., Title and Escrow), cash management products to a variety of businesses, and commercial & industrial and commercial real estate lending to clients. The Banking Business also includes a bankruptcy trustee and fiduciary service that provides specialized software and consulting services to Chapter 7 bankruptcy and non-Chapter 7 trustees and fiduciaries.
The Securities Business includes the Clearing Broker-Dealer, Registered Investment Advisor, and Introducing Broker-Dealer lines of businesses. These lines of business offer products independently to their own customers as well as to Banking Business clients. The products offered by the lines of business in the Securities Business primarily generate net interest and non-banking service fee income.
Segment results are determined based upon the management reporting system, which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments. The process is designed around the organizational and management structure and, accordingly, the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions or in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on profit or loss from operations. There are no material inter-segment sales or transfers. Certain corporate administration costs and income taxes have not been allocated to the reportable segments. Therefore, in order to reconcile the two segments to the consolidated totals, we include parent-only activities and intercompany eliminations.
BANKING BUSINESS
We distribute our deposit products through a wide range of retail distribution channels, and our deposits consist of demand, savings and time deposits accounts. We distribute our loan products through our retail, correspondent and wholesale channels, and the loans we retain are primarily first mortgages secured by single family real property and by multifamily real property as well as commercial & industrial loans to businesses. Our mortgage-backed securities consist of mortgage pass-through securities issued by government-sponsored entities, non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations, and asset-backed mortgage-backed securities issued by private sponsors. We believe our flexibility to adjust our asset generation channels has been a competitive advantage allowing us to avoid markets and products where credit fundamentals are poor or rewards are not sufficient to support our required return on equity.
Our distribution channels for our bank deposit and lending products include:

• | Multiple national online banking brands with tailored products targeted to specific consumer segments;


• | Affinity groups where we gain access to the affinity group’s members, and our exclusive relationships with financial advisory firms;


• | A business banking division focused on providing deposit products and loans to specific nationwide industry verticals (e.g., Homeowners’ Associations) and small and medium size businesses;


• | A commission-based lending sales force that operates from home offices focusing primarily on the origination of single family and multifamily mortgage loans;


• | A commission-based lending sales force that operates from our San Diego office focusing on commercial and industrial loans to businesses;


• | A commission-based leasing sales force that operates from our Salt Lake City office focusing on commercial and industrial leases to businesses;


• | A bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy trustee and fiduciary services team that operates from our Kansas City office focusing on specialized software and consulting services that provide deposits; and


• | Inside sales teams that originate loans and deposits from self-generated leads, third-party purchase leads, and from our retention and cross-sell of our existing customer base.

Banking Business - Asset Origination and Fee Income Businesses
 We have built diverse loan origination and fee income businesses that generate attractive financial returns through our digital distribution channels. We believe the diversity of our businesses and our direct and indirect distribution channels provide us with increased flexibility to manage through changing market and operating environments.
Single Family Mortgage Secured Lending
We generate earning assets and fee income from our mortgage lending activities, which consist of originating and servicing mortgages secured primarily by first liens on single family residential properties for consumers and for lender-finance businesses. We divide our single family mortgage originations between loans we retain and loans we sell. Our mortgage banking business generates fee income and gains from sales of those consumer single family mortgage loans we sell. Our loan portfolio generates interest income and fees from loans we retain. We also provide home equity loans for consumers secured by second liens on single family mortgages. Our lender-finance loans are secured by our first lien on single family mortgages and include warehouse lines for third-party mortgage companies.
We originate fixed and adjustable rate prime residential mortgage loans using a paperless loan origination system and centralized underwriting and closing process. We warehouse our mortgage banking loans and sell to investors prime conforming and jumbo residential mortgage loans. Our mortgage servicing business includes collecting loan payments, applying principal and interest payments to the loan balance, managing escrow funds for the payment of mortgage-related expenses, such as taxes and insurance, responding to customer inquiries, counseling delinquent mortgagors and supervising foreclosures.
We originate single family mortgage loans for consumers through multiple channels on a retail, wholesale and correspondent basis.

• | Retail. We originate single family mortgage loans directly through i) our multiple national online banking brand websites, where our customers can view interest rates and loan terms, enter their loan applications and lock in interest rates directly online, ii) our relationships with large affinity groups and iii) our call center which uses self-generated internet leads, third-party purchased leads, and cross-selling to our existing customer base.


• | Wholesale. We have developed relationships with independent mortgage companies, cooperatives and individual loan brokers and we manage these relationships and our wholesale loan pipeline through our originations systems and websites. Through our secure website, our approved brokers can compare programs, terms and pricing on a real time basis and communicate with our staff.


• | Correspondent. We acquire closed loans from third-party mortgage companies that originate single family loans in accordance with our portfolio specifications or the specifications of our investors. We may purchase pools of seasoned, single-family loans originated by others during economic cycles when those loans have more attractive risk-adjusted returns than those we may originate.

We originate lender-finance loans to businesses secured by first liens on single family mortgage loans from cross selling, retail direct and through third-parties. Our warehouse customers are primarily generated through cross selling to our network of third-party mortgage companies approved to wholesale our consumer mortgage loans. Other lender-finance customers are generated by our commissions-based sales force dedicated to commercial & industrial lending who contact borrowers directly or through individual loan brokers.
Multifamily Mortgage Secured Lending
We originate adjustable rate multifamily residential mortgage loans and project-based multifamily real-estate-secured loans with interest rates that adjust based on U.S. Treasury security yields and London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). Many of our loans have initial fixed rate periods (three, five or seven years) before starting a regular adjustment period (annually, semi-annually or monthly) as well as prepayment protection clauses, interest rate floors, ceilings and rate change caps.
We divide our multifamily residential mortgage originations between the loans we retain and the loans we sell. Our mortgage banking business includes gains from those multifamily mortgage loans we sell. Our loan portfolio generates interest income and fees from the loans we retain.
We originate multifamily mortgage loans using a commission-based commercial lending sales force that operates from home offices across the United States or from our San Diego location. Customers are targeted through origination techniques such as direct mail marketing, personal sales efforts, email marketing, online marketing and print advertising. Loan applications are submitted electronically to centralized employee teams who underwrite, process and close loans. The sales force team members operate regionally both as retail originators for apartment owners and wholesale representatives to other mortgage brokers.
Commercial Real Estate Secured and Commercial Lending
Our commercial real estate-secured lending consists of mortgages secured by first liens on commercial real estate. Historically, we have limited our exposure to commercial real estate and have primarily purchased seasoned mortgages on small commercial properties when they were offered as a part of a residential mortgage loan pool. In fiscal 2015, we began to originate adjustable rate small balance commercial real estate loans with interest rates that adjust based on U.S. Treasury security yields and LIBOR. Many of our loans have initial fixed rate periods (three, five or seven years) before starting a regular adjustment period (annually, semi-annually or monthly) as well as prepayment protection clauses, interest rate floors, ceilings and rate change caps.
Our commercial and industrial lending (“C&I”) is primarily comprised of real estate-backed and asset-backed loans and leases to businesses and non-bank lenders. We started our C&I lending in 2010 with a focus on business cash flow lending and have subsequently moved to providing financing to non-bank lenders that originate lending products secured by residential and commercial real estate assets. Our C&I lending has also expanded to other specialty commercial real estate lending types, as well as to other asset-based lending secured by non-real estate-related collateral.
Our C&I group also provides leases to small businesses and middle market companies that use the funds to purchase machinery, equipment and software essential to their operations. The lease terms are generally between two and ten years and amortize primarily to full repayment, or in some cases, to a residual balance that is expected to be collected through the sale of the collateral to the lessee or to a third party. The leases are offered nationwide to companies in targeted industries through a direct sales force and through independent third party sales referrals.
Specialty Finance Factoring
Our specialty finance division engages in the wholesale and retail purchase of state lottery prize and structured settlement annuity payments. These payments are high credit quality deferred payment receivables having a state lottery commission or primarily highly rated insurance company payor. Purchases of state lottery prize or structured settlement annuity payments are governed by specific state statutes requiring judicial approval of each transaction. No transaction is funded before an order approving such transaction has been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction. Our commission-based sales force originates contracts for the retail purchase of such payments from leads generated by our dedicated research department through the use of proprietary research techniques. The Specialty Finance Division also utilizes direct mail and online marketing to generate leads. Since 2013, pools of structured settlement receivables have been originated for sale depending upon management’s assessment of interest rate risk, liquidity, and offers containing favorable terms.
Prepaid Cards and Refund Transfer
Our prepaid cards division provides card issuing and bank identification number (“BIN”) sponsorship services to companies who have developed payroll, general purpose reloadable, incentive and gift card programs. BIN Sponsorship includes issuing debit and prepaid cards from BINs licensed to the Bank by the various payment networks, managing risk for all programs, overseeing compliance with network and government regulations, and functioning as liaison between program managers and the payment networks. These programs generate fee income and low-cost deposits.
We are also responsible for the primary oversight and control of a refund transfer program under an agreement with Emerald Financial Services, LLC (“EFS”), a wholly owned subsidiary of H&R Block, Inc. (“H&R Block”). Under this program, the Bank opens a temporary bank account for each H&R Block customer who is receiving an income tax refund and elects to defer payment of his or her tax preparations fees. After the Internal Revenue Service and any state income tax authorities transfer the refund into the customer’s account, the net funds are transferred to the customer and the temporary deposit account is closed. We earn a fixed fee paid by H&R Block for each of the H&R Block customers electing a refund transfer.
Automobile Lending
Our automobile lending division originates prime loans to customers secured by new and used automobiles (“autos”). In 2015 and 2016 we added systems and personnel to increase our auto lending portfolio. We hold all of the auto loans that we have originated and perform the loan servicing functions for these loans.
Other Consumer and Business Lending
We originate fixed rate term unsecured loans to individual borrowers in all fifty states. We offer loans between $5,000 and $35,000 with terms of twelve, twenty-four, thirty-six, forty-eight and sixty months to well qualified borrowers.  The minimum credit score is 680.  All applicants apply digitally and are required to supply proof of income, identity and bank account documentation.  One hundred percent of loans are manually underwritten by a seasoned underwriter with a telephone interview conducted in respect of every approved loan prior to funding. We source our unsecured loans through existing bank customers, lead aggregators and additional marketing efforts.
Through our strategic partnerships division, our Bank establishes contractual relationships with third-party service providers (“Program Managers”) possessing demonstrated expertise in managing programs involving marketing and processing financial products such as credit, debit, and prepaid cards, and small business and consumer loans. These relationships include our relationships with H&R Block, Netspend and BFS Capital, among others. As delineated by the related contracts, a Program Manager provides program management services in its areas of expertise subject to our Bank’s continuing control and active supervision of the subject program. Underwriting standards and credit decisioning remain with our Bank in all cases. Each of these relationships is designed to allow our Bank to leverage the Program Manager’s knowledge and experience to distribute program-related financial products to a broad base of customers. With respect to credit products, our Bank generally originates the resulting receivable for sale, but may, in its discretion, retain such receivable. Our Bank performs extensive due diligence with respect to each Program Manager and program, and maintains a regimen of comprehensive risk management and strict compliance oversight with respect to all programs. Under agreements with EFS and H&R Block, our Bank uses our underwriting guidelines and credit policies to offer and fund unsecured lines of credit to consumers primarily through the H&R Block tax preparation offices and earns interest income and fee income. Our Bank retains 10% of these lines of credit and sells the remainder to H&R Block. Our Bank also originates or purchases interest-free loans to consumers that are offered primarily through H&R Block tax preparation offices. Our Bank has a limited guarantee from H&R Block that reduces our Bank’s credit exposure on these interest-free loans.
Our Bank also provides overdraft lines of credit for our qualifying deposit customers with checking accounts.
Portfolio Management
Our investment analysis capabilities are a core competency of our organization. We decide whether to hold originated assets for investment or to sell them in the capital markets based on our assessment of the yield and risk characteristics of these assets as compared to other available opportunities to deploy our capital. Because risk-adjusted returns available on acquisitions may exceed returns available through retaining assets from our origination channels, we have elected to purchase loans and securities (see discussion below) from time to time. Some of our loans and security acquisitions were purchased at discounts to par value, which enhance our effective yield through accretion into income in subsequent periods.

 Consists of mortgage loans secured by real property in California with ZIP Code ranges from 93000 to 96999.
The ratio of the loan amount to the value of the property securing the loan is called the loan-to-value ratio (“LTV”). The following table shows the LTVs of our loan portfolio on weighted-average and median bases at June 30, 2019. The LTVs were calculated by dividing (a) the loan principal balance less principal repayments by (b) the appraisal value of the property securing the loan.

 | | | Single family | | | 
 | Total Real Estate Mortgage Loans | | Mortgage | | Home Equity1 | Multifamily real estate secured | | Commercial real estate secured 
Weighted Average LTV | 55.50 | % | | 57.23 | % | 29.68 | % | | 52.59 | % | 49.10 | %
Median LTV | 55.82 | % | | 57.91 | % | 52.59 | % | | 50.43 | % | 47.40 | %

1 Amounts represent combined LTV calculated by adding the current balances of both the first and second liens of the borrower and dividing that sum by an independent estimated value of the property at the time of origination.
Our effective weighted-average LTV of 55.77% for real estate mortgage loans originated during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 has resulted, and we believe will continue to result, in relatively low average loan defaults and favorable write-off experience.
Loan Underwriting Process and Criteria. We individually underwrite the loans that we originate and all loans that we purchase. For our brand partnership lending products, we construct or validate loan origination models to meet our minimum standards as further described below. Our loan underwriting policies and procedures are written and adopted by our board of directors and our credit committee. Credit extensions generated by the Bank conform to the intent and technical requirements of our lending policies and the applicable lending regulations of our federal regulators.
In the underwriting process we consider all relevant factors including the borrower’s credit score, credit history, documented income, existing and new debt obligations, the value of the collateral, and other internal and external factors. For all multifamily and commercial loans, we rely primarily on the cash flow from the underlying property as the expected source of repayment, but we also endeavor to obtain personal guarantees from all material owners or partners of the borrower. In evaluating a multifamily or commercial credit, we consider all relevant factors including the outside financial assets of the material owners or partners, payment history at the Bank or other financial institutions, and the management / ownership experience with similar properties or businesses. In evaluating the borrower’s qualifications, we consider primarily the borrower’s other financial resources, experience in owning or managing similar properties and payment history with us or other financial institutions. In evaluating the underlying property, we consider primarily the recurring net operating income of the property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of net operating income to debt service and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value.
Lending Limits. As a savings association, we are generally subject to the same lending limit rules applicable to national banks. With limited exceptions, the maximum amount that we may lend to any borrower, including related entities of the borrower, at any one time may not exceed 15% of our unimpaired capital and surplus, plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus for loans fully secured by readily marketable collateral. See “Regulation of Axos Bank” for further information. At June 30, 2019, the Bank’s loans-to-one-borrower limit was $148.5 million, based upon the 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus measurement. At June 30, 2019, our largest loan and single lending relationship was $140.0 million.
Loan and Lease Quality and Credit Risk. Historically, our level of non-performing mortgage loans as a percentage of our loan and lease portfolio has been relatively low compared to the overall residential lending market. The economy and the mortgage and consumer credit markets have stabilized. Additionally, we have recently increased our efforts to make loans to businesses through lending programs that are not as seasoned as our mortgage lending. Therefore, we anticipate that our rate of non-performing loans and leases may increase in the future, and we have provided an allowance for estimated loan and lease losses.
Non-performing assets are defined as non-performing loans and leases, real estate acquired by foreclosure or deed-in-lieu thereof and repossessed vehicles. Generally, non-performing loans and leases are defined as nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases 90 days or more overdue. Troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) are defined as loans that we have agreed to modify by accepting below market terms either by granting interest rate concessions or by deferring principal or interest payments due to financial difficulty of the customer. Our policy with respect to non-performing assets is to place such assets on nonaccrual status when, in the judgment of management, the probability of collection of interest is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual. When a loan or lease is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest will be deducted from interest income. Our general policy is to not accrue interest on loans and leases past due 90 days or more, unless the individual borrower circumstances dictate otherwise.

We classify each investment security according to our intent to hold the security to maturity, trade the security at fair value or make the security available-for-sale. We invest available funds in government and high-grade non-agency securities. Our investment policy, as established by our Board of Directors, is designed to maintain liquidity and generate a favorable return on investment without incurring undue interest rate risk, credit risk or portfolio asset concentration risk. Under our investment policy, we are currently authorized to invest in agency mortgage-backed obligations issued or fully guaranteed by the United States government, non-agency mortgage-backed obligations, specific federal agency obligations, municipal obligations, specific time deposits, negotiable certificates of deposit issued by commercial banks and other insured financial institutions, investment grade corporate debt securities and other specified investments. We also buy and sell securities to facilitate liquidity and to help manage our interest rate risk. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company elected to reclassify all of its held-to-maturity securities to available-for-sale. See Note 4 – “Securities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
The following table sets forth the dollar amount of our securities portfolio by intent at the end of each of the last five fiscal years:

 Weighted-average yield is based on amortized cost of the securities. Residential mortgage-backed security yields and maturities include impact of expected prepayments and other timing factors such as interest rate forward curve. Yields presented in this table are adjusted for OTTI, which is non-accretable.
 U.S. government-backed or government-sponsored enterprises including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae.
 Private sponsors of securities collateralized primarily by pools of 1-4 family residential first mortgages. Primarily super senior securities and secured by prime, Alt-A or pay-option ARM mortgages.
Our securities portfolio of $227.5 million at June 30, 2019 is composed of approximately 4.2% U.S. agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and other debt securities issued by the government-sponsored enterprises primarily, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (each, a “GSE” and, together, the “GSEs”); 0.8% U.S. Treasury securities; 0.6% Alt-A, private-issue super senior, first-lien RMBS; 5.1% Pay-Option ARM, private-issue super senior first-lien RMBS; 9.3% Municipal securities and 80.0% asset-backed and whole business securities secured by consumer receivables. We had no commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”), sub-prime RMBS, or bank pooled trust preferred securities at June 30, 2019.
We manage the credit risk of our non-agency RMBS by purchasing those securities which we believe have the most favorable blend of historic credit performance and remaining credit enhancements including subordination, over collateralization, excess spread and purchase discounts. Substantially all of our non-agency RMBS are super senior tranches protected against realized loss by subordinated tranches. The amount of structural subordination available to protect each of our securities (expressed as a percentage of the current face value) is known as credit enhancement. At June 30, 2019, the weighted-average credit enhancement in our entire non-agency RMBS portfolio was 19.0%. The credit enhancement percentage and the ratings agency grade (e.g. “AA”) do not consider additional credit protection available to the Bank, if needed, from its purchase discount. All of the Bank’s non-agency RMBS purchases were at a discount to par and we do not solely rely upon nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (“NRSRO”) ratings when determining classification. This change in Bank policy was brought about by changes in regulatory stance regarding classification of securities as mandated by Congress under section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act, which required any reference to, or reliance on, NRSROs to be removed when determining the creditworthiness of securities. We have experienced personnel monitor the performance and measure the security for impairment in accordance with regulatory guidance. As of June 30, 2019, 26.9% of our non-agency RMBS securities have been downgraded from investment grade at acquisition to below investment grade. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis—“Critical Accounting Policies—Securities.”

Our consumer and business deposit balances consisted of 66.5% and 33.5% of total deposits at June 30, 2019, respectively. Our business deposit accounts feature a full suite of treasury and cash management products for our business customers including online and mobile banking, remote deposit capture, analyzed business checking and money market accounts. We service our business customers by providing them with a dedicated relationship manager and an experienced business banking operations team.
Our deposit operations are conducted through a centralized, scalable operating platform which supports all of our distribution channels. The integrated nature of our systems and our ability to efficiently scale our operations create competitive advantages that support our value proposition to customers. Additionally, the features described above such as online account opening and online bill-pay promote self-service and further reduce our operating expenses.
We believe our deposit franchise will continue to provide lower all-in funding costs (interest expense plus operating costs) with greater scalability than branch-intensive banking models because the traditional branch model with high fixed operating costs will experience continued declines in consumer traffic due to the decline in paper check deposits and due to growing consumer preferences to bank online.

SECURITIES BUSINESS
Our Securities Business consists of two sets of products and services, securities services provided to third-party securities firms and investment management provided to consumers.
Securities services.  We offer fully disclosed clearing services through Axos Clearing to FINRA- and SEC-registered member firms for trade execution and clearance as well as back office services such as record keeping, trade reporting, accounting, general back-office support, securities and margin lending, reorganization assistance and custody of securities. At June 30, 2019, we provided services to 62 financial organizations, including correspondent broker-dealers and registered investment advisers. 
We provide financing to our brokerage customers for their securities trading activities through margin loans that are collateralized by securities, cash, or other acceptable collateral. We earn a spread equal to the difference between the amount we pay to fund the margin loans and the amount of interest income we receive from our customers.
We conduct securities lending activities that include borrowing and lending securities with other broker-dealers. These activities involve borrowing securities to cover short sales and to complete transactions in which clients have failed to deliver securities by the required settlement date, and lending securities to other broker dealers for similar purposes.  The net revenues for this business consist of the interest spreads generated on these activities.
We assist our brokerage customers in managing their cash balances and earn a fee through an insured bank deposit cash sweep program. 
Investment management. Through our digital wealth management business, Axos Invest, we provide our retail customers with investment management services through a comprehensive and flexible technology platform. We expect to integrate our digital wealth management platform into our universal digital banking platform in the near future, creating a seamless user experience and a holistic personal financial management ecosystem. Our digital wealth management business generates fee income from clients paying for premium services and deposits from uninvested cash balances.
Borrowings. In addition to deposits, we have historically funded our asset growth through advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (“FHLB”). Our bank can borrow up to 40% of its total assets from the FHLB, and borrowings are collateralized by mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities pledged to the FHLB. At June 30, 2019, the Company had $458.5 million advances outstanding with another $2.0 billion available immediately, which represents a fully collateralized position, for advances from the FHLB for terms up to ten years.
The Bank has federal funds lines of credit with two major banks totaling $35.0 million. At June 30, 2019, the Bank had no outstanding balance on either line.
The Bank can also borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (“FRB”), and borrowings may be collateralized by commercial, consumer and mortgage loans as well as securities pledged to the FRB. Based on loans and securities pledged at June 30, 2019, we had a total borrowing capacity of approximately $1.6 billion, none of which was outstanding. The Bank has additional unencumbered collateral that could be pledged to the FRB Discount Window to increase borrowing liquidity.
Axos Clearing has a total of $155.0 million uncommitted secured lines of credit available for borrowing as needed. As of June 30, 2019, there was $106.8 million outstanding. These credit facilities bear interest at rates based on the Federal Funds rate and are due upon demand. The weighted average interest rate on the borrowings at June 30, 2019 was 3.84%.
Axos Clearing has a $35.0 million committed unsecured line of credit available for limited purpose borrowing. As of June 30, 2019, there was $0.0 million outstanding. This credit facility bears interest at rates based on the Federal Funds rate and 
are due upon demand. The unsecured line of credit requires Axos Clearing operate in accordance of specific covenants surrounding capital and debt ratios. Axos Clearing was in compliance of all covenants as of June 30, 2019.
On December 16, 2004, we completed a transaction in which we formed a trust and issued $5.0 million of trust-preferred securities. The net proceeds from the offering were used to purchase approximately $5.2 million of junior subordinated debentures of our Company with a stated maturity date of February 23, 2035. The debentures are the sole assets of the trust. The trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity, or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indenture. We have the right to redeem the debentures in whole (but not in part) on or after specific dates, at a redemption price specified in the indenture plus any accrued but unpaid interest through the redemption date. Interest accrues at the rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.4%, for a rate of 4.92% as of June 30, 2019, and is paid quarterly.
In March 2016, we completed the sale of $51.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.25% Subordinated Notes due February 28, 2026 (the “Notes”). We received $51.0 million in gross proceeds as a part of this transaction, before the 3.15% underwriting discount and other offering expenses. The Notes mature on February 28, 2026 and accrue interest at a rate of 6.25% per annum, with interest payable quarterly. The Notes may be redeemed on or after March 31, 2021, which date may be extended at our discretion, at a redemption price equal to principal plus accrued and unpaid interest, subject to certain conditions.
On January 28, 2019, we issued subordinated notes totaling $7.5 million, to the principal stockholders of COR Securities in an equal principal amount, with a maturity of 15 months, to serve as the sole source of payment of indemnification obligations of the principal stakeholders of COR Securities under the Merger Agreement. Interest accrues at a rate of 6.25% per annum. During the three months ended June 30, 2019, $0.1 million of subordinated loans were repaid.
The table below sets forth the amount of our borrowings, the maximum amount of borrowings in each category during any month-end during each reported period, the approximate average amounts outstanding during each reported period and the approximate weighted average interest rate thereon at or for the last five fiscal years:

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS
 From time to time we undertake acquisitions or similar transactions consistent with our operating and growth strategies. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, there were transactions that are discussed further in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading “Mergers and Acquisitions.”
TECHNOLOGY
Our technology is built on a collection of enterprise and client platforms that have been purchased, developed in-house or integrated with software systems to provide products and services to our customers. The implementation of our technology has 
been conducted using industry best-practices and using standardized approaches in system design, software development, testing and delivery. At the core of our infrastructure, we have designed and implemented secure and scalable hardware solutions to ensure we meet the needs of our business. Our customer experiences were designed to address the needs of an internet-only bank and its customers. Our websites and technology platforms drive our customer-focused and self-service engagement model, reducing the need for human interaction while increasing our overall operating efficiencies. Our focus on internal technology platforms enable continuous automation and secure and scalable processing environments for increased transaction capacity. We intend to continue to improve and adapt technology platforms to meet business objectives and implement new systems with the goal of efficiently enabling our business.
SECURITY
We recognize that information is a critical asset.  How information is managed, controlled and protected has a significant impact on the delivery of services. Information assets, including those held in trust, must be protected from unauthorized use, disclosure, theft, loss, destruction and alteration.
We employ an information security program to achieve our security objectives. The program is designed to identify, measure, manage and control the risks to system and data availability, integrity, and confidentiality, and to ensure accountability for system actions.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
We register our various Internet URL addresses with service companies, and work actively with bank regulators to identify potential naming conflicts with competing financial institutions. Policing unauthorized use of proprietary information is difficult and litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. We own certain Internet domain names. Domain names in the United States and in foreign countries are regulated, and the laws and regulations governing the Internet are continually evolving. Additionally, the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting intellectual property rights is not entirely clear. As a result, in the future, we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that infringe or otherwise decrease the value of our trademark and other intellectual property rights.
EMPLOYEES
At June 30, 2019, we had 1007 full-time equivalent employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppage and consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
COMPETITION
The market for banking and financial services is intensely competitive, and we expect competition to continue to intensify in the future. The Bank attracts deposits through its online acquisition channels. Competition for those deposits comes from a wide variety of other banks, savings institutions, and credit unions. The Bank competes for these deposits by offering superior service and a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates.
In real estate lending, we compete against traditional real estate lenders, including large and small savings banks, commercial banks, mortgage bankers and mortgage brokers. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources and are capable of providing strong price and customer service competition. In order to compete profitably, we may need to reduce the rates we offer on loans and leases and investments and increase the rates we offer on deposits, which may adversely affect our overall financial condition and earnings. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.
REGULATION
GENERAL
Axos Financial, Inc. (the “Company”) is regulated as a savings and loan holding company by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The Company is required to file reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of, the Federal Reserve. The Bank, as a federal savings bank, is subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) as its primary regulator, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as its deposit insurer. The Bank must file reports with the OCC and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), enacted on July 21, 2010, created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve that has broad authority to issue regulations implementing numerous consumer laws, to which we are subject.
The regulation of savings and loan holding companies and savings associations is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and not for the benefit of our stockholders. The following information describes aspects of the material laws and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank. The information below does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, new and amended legislation, rules and regulations governing the Company and the Bank are introduced from time to time by the U.S. government and its various agencies. Any such legislation, regulatory changes or amendments could adversely affect the Company or the Bank, and no assurance can be given as to whether, or in what form, any such changes may occur.
REGULATION OF FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY.
General. The Company is a unitary savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act (“HOLA”), and is treated as a “financial holding company” under Federal Reserve rules. Accordingly, the Company is registered as a savings and loan holding company with the Federal Reserve and is subject to the Federal Reserve’s regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements. In addition, the Federal Reserve has enforcement authority over the Company and its subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution. 
 Capital. Savings and loan holding companies, such as the Company, were historically not subject to specific regulatory capital requirements. However, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, savings and loan holding companies are now subject to the same capital and activity requirements as those applicable to bank holding companies. Moreover, the Dodd-Frank Act required that the Federal Reserve promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are not less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. 
In July 2013, the Company’s primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve, and the Bank’s primary federal regulator, the OCC, published final rules (the “New Capital Rules”) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The rules implement the Basel Committee’s December 2010 capital framework known as “Basel III” for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The New Capital Rules substantially revise the capital requirements applicable to depository institutions and their holding companies, including the 
Company and the Bank, and are discussed in more detail below under “Regulation of Axos Bank – Regulatory Capital Requirements and Prompt Corrective Action”. 
 Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act extends the Federal Reserve “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. Such policy requires holding companies to act as a source of financial strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of an institution’s financial distress. The regulatory agencies have yet to issue joint regulations implementing this policy.
 Change in Control. The federal banking laws require that appropriate regulatory approvals must be obtained before an individual or company may take actions to “control” a bank or savings association. The definition of control found in the HOLA is similar to that found in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (“BHCA”) for bank holding companies. Both statutes apply a similar three-prong test for determining when a company controls a bank or savings association. Specifically, a company has control over either a bank or savings association if the company:

• | directly or indirectly or acting in concert with one or more persons, owns, controls, or has the power to vote 25% or more of the voting securities of a company;


• | controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors (or any individual who performs similar functions in respect of any company, including a trustee under a trust) of the board; or


• | directly or indirectly exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank.

Regulation LL, which was implemented in 2011 by the Federal Reserve, includes a specific definition of “control” similar to the statutory definition, with certain additional provisions. Additionally, Regulation LL modifies the regulations for purposes of determining when a company or natural person acquires control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company under the HOLA or the Change in Bank Control Act (“CBCA”). In light of the similarity between the statutes governing bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies, the Federal Reserve uses its established rules and processes with respect to control determinations under HOLA and the CBCA to ensure consistency between equivalent statutes administered by the same agency.
Furthermore, the Federal Reserve may not approve any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions; (i) the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies and (ii) the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisition. The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.
In August 2018 the Company received approval from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and became a savings and loan holding company that is treated as a financial holding company under the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve. Financial holding companies are generally permitted to affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are "financial in nature." Such activities include, among other things, securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking activities; and activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking. No regulatory approval is required for a financial holding company to acquire a company, other than a bank or savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve.
REGULATION OF BANKING BUSINESS
General. As a federally-chartered savings and loan association whose deposit accounts are insured by FDIC, Axos Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the FDIC and the OCC. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the examination, regulation and supervision of savings associations, such as Axos Bank, were transferred from the OTS to the OCC, the federal regulator of national banks under the National Bank Act. The following discussion summarizes some of the principal areas of regulation applicable to the Bank and its operations. 
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The FDIC administers a deposit insurance fund (the “DIF”) that insures depositors in certain types of accounts up to a prescribed amount for the loss of any such depositor’s respective deposits due to the failure of an FDIC member depository institution. As the administrator of the DIF, the FDIC assesses its member depository institutions and determines the appropriate DIF premiums to be paid by each such institution. The FDIC is authorized to examine its member institutions and to require that they file periodic reports of their condition and operations. The FDIC may also prohibit any member institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the DIF. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings associations, after giving the primary federal regulator the opportunity to take such action. The FDIC may terminate an institution’s access to the DIF if it determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of our access to the DIF.
Axos Bank is a member depository institution of the FDIC and its deposits are insured by the DIF up to the applicable limits, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. Effective with the passing of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, the basic deposit insurance limit was permanently raised to $250,000, instead of the $100,000 limit previously in effect.
Regulatory Capital Requirements and Prompt Corrective Action. The prompt corrective action regulation of the OCC requires mandatory actions and authorizes other discretionary actions to be taken by the OCC against a savings association that falls within undercapitalized capital categories specified in OCC regulations.
The New Capital Rules narrow the definition of regulatory capital and establish higher minimum risk-based capital ratios that as of January 1, 2019, requires banking organizations to maintain a minimum “common equity Tier 1” (or “CET1”) ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% (increased from 4.0%), a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets). 
A capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above each of these levels (phased in over three years starting in 2016, beginning at 0.625% and increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reached 2.5% on January 1, 2019) is required for banking institutions to avoid restrictions on their ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends.
The New Capital Rules provide for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and were phased in over three years for the Bank.
The implementation of certain regulations and standards relating to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect our regulatory capital position relative to that of our competitors, including those that may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as the Bank. Various aspects of Basel III continue to be subject to further evaluation and interpretation by the U.S. banking regulators. As of June 30, 2019, the Company and the Bank remain well-capitalized under the currently enacted capital adequacy requirements of Basel III, and remain well-capitalized when including implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 on a fully phased-in basis.
In general, the prompt corrective action regulation prohibits an FDIC member institution from declaring any dividends, making any other capital distribution, or paying a management fee to a controlling person if, following the distribution or payment, the institution would be within any of the three undercapitalized categories. In addition, adequately capitalized institutions may accept brokered deposits only with a waiver from the FDIC, but are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions may not accept, renew or roll-over brokered deposits.
If the OCC determines that an institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition, or if the institution is deemed to be engaging in an unsafe and unsound practice, the OCC may, if the institution is well-capitalized, reclassify it as adequately capitalized. If the institution is adequately capitalized, but not well-capitalized, the OCC may require it to comply with restrictions applicable to undercapitalized institutions. If the institution is undercapitalized, the OCC may require it to comply with restrictions applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions. Finally, pursuant to an interagency agreement, the FDIC can examine any institution that has a substandard regulatory examination score or is considered undercapitalized without the express permission of the institution’s primary regulator.
Capital regulations applicable to savings associations such as the Bank also require savings associations to meet the additional capital standard of tangible capital equal to at least 1.5% of total adjusted assets.
The Bank’s capital requirements are viewed as minimum standards and most financial institutions are expected to maintain capital levels well above the minimum. In addition, OCC regulations provide that minimum capital levels greater than those provided in the regulations may be established by the OCC for individual savings associations upon a determination that the 
savings association’s capital is or may become inadequate in view of its circumstances. Axos Bank is not subject to any such individual minimum regulatory capital requirement and the Bank’s regulatory capital exceeded all minimum regulatory capital requirements as of June 30, 2019. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Stress Testing. Enhanced prudential standards for larger institutions mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act were implemented by FRB regulation, which require additional risk management policies and practices and annual stress testing designed to determine whether capital planning, assessment of capital adequacy and risk management practices of regulated bank and savings and loan holding companies adequately protect them in the event of an economic downturn. The original FRB rules implemented stress tests to be conducted by the FRB and company-run stress tests for institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. Our total assets exceeded $10 billion beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2019. 
However, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”) enacted in May 2018 scaled back certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the requirement to conduct an annual stress test that projects performance under various economic scenarios. The annual stress test requirement no longer applies to the Company, as a savings and loan holding company with less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets. Under the Economic Growth Act, the Bank will also become exempt from Dodd-Frank Act stress testing effective November 25, 2019; however, the FRB has extended the deadline for all regulatory requirements related to company-run stress testing for institutions with average total assets of less than $100 billion until such effective date, thereby effectively exempting the Bank from stress-testing requirements as of the enactment of the Economic Growth Act.
Notwithstanding the Economic Growth Act’s amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act stress testing requirements, the federal banking agencies have indicated through interagency guidance that the capital planning and risk management practices of financial institutions with total assets less than $100 billion would continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process.  We will continue to monitor our capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the FRB and will continue to use customized stress testing as part of our capital planning process
Standards for Safety and Soundness. The federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed, by regulation, guidelines for all insured depository institutions relating to: (i) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) interest rate risk exposure; (v) asset growth; (vi) asset quality; (vii) earnings; and (viii) compensation, fees and benefits. The guidelines set forth safety and soundness standards that the federal banking regulatory agencies use to identify and address problems at FDIC member institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the OCC determines that the Bank fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the OCC may require us to submit to it an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. OCC regulations establish deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans in response to any such determination. We are not aware of any conditions relating to these safety and soundness standards that would require us to submit a plan of compliance to the OCC.
Loans-to-One-Borrower Limitations. Savings associations generally are subject to the lending limits applicable to national banks. With limited exceptions, the maximum amount that a savings association or a national bank may lend to any borrower, including related entities of the borrower, at one time may not exceed 15% of the unimpaired capital and surplus of the institution, plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus for loans fully secured by readily marketable collateral. Savings associations are additionally authorized to make loans to one borrower by order of its regulator, in an amount not to exceed the lesser of $30.0 million or 30% of unimpaired capital and surplus for the purpose of developing residential housing, if the following specified conditions are met:

• | The savings association is in compliance with its fully phased-in capital requirements;


• | The loans comply with applicable loan-to-value requirements; and


• | The aggregate amount of loans made under this authority does not exceed 150% of unimpaired capital and surplus.

Qualified Thrift Lender Test. Savings associations must meet a qualified thrift lender, or “QTL,” test. This test may be met either by maintaining a specified level of portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments as specified by the HOLA, or by meeting the definition of a “domestic building and loan association” under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the “Code”. Qualified thrift investments are primarily residential mortgage loans and related investments, including mortgage related securities. Portfolio assets generally mean total assets less specified liquid assets, goodwill and other intangible assets and the value of property used in the conduct of the Bank’s business. The required percentage of qualified thrift investments under the HOLA is 65% of “portfolio assets” (defined as total assets less: (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (ii) intangibles, including goodwill; and (iii) the value of property used to conduct business). An association must be in compliance with the QTL test or the definition of domestic building and loan association on a monthly basis in nine out of every 12 months. Savings associations that fail to meet the QTL test will generally be prohibited from engaging in any activity not permitted for both a 
national bank and a savings association. At June 30, 2019, the Bank was in compliance with its QTL requirement and met the definition of a domestic building and loan association.
Liquidity Standard. Savings associations are required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations. As of June 30, 2019, Axos Bank was in compliance with the applicable liquidity standard.
Volcker Rule.  Effective April 15, 2014, the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations with a conformance period for certain features that lasted until July 21, 2017, to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act known as the Volcker Rule. Under the regulations, FDIC-insured depository institutions, their holding companies, subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “banking entities”), are generally prohibited, subject to certain exemptions, from proprietary trading of securities and other financial instruments and from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in a “covered fund.”  The term “covered fund” can include, in addition to many private equity and hedge funds and other entities, certain collateralized mortgage obligations, collateralized debt obligations and collateralized loan obligations, and other items, but does not include wholly owned subsidiaries, certain joint ventures, or loan securitizations generally if the underlying assets are solely loans. 
Trading in certain government obligations is not prohibited by the Volcker Rule, including obligations of or guaranteed by the United States or an agency or government-sponsored entity of the United States, obligations of a State of the United States or a political subdivision thereof, and municipal securities. Proprietary trading generally does not include transactions under repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions and purchases and sales for the purpose of liquidity management if the liquidity management plan meets specified criteria; nor does it generally include transactions undertaken in a fiduciary capacity.  In addition, activities eligible for exemption include, among others, certain brokerage, underwriting and marketing activities, and risk-mitigating hedging activities with respect to specific risks and subject to specified conditions. As of June 30, 2019, Axos Bank was in compliance with the Volcker Rule.
Transactions with Related Parties. The authority of the Bank to engage in transactions with “affiliates” (i.e., any company that controls or is under common control with it, including the Company and any non-depository institution subsidiaries) is limited by federal law. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate is limited to 10% of the capital and surplus of the savings institution. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of a savings institution’s capital and surplus. Certain transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type described in federal law. The purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. Transactions with affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances that are at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. In addition, savings institutions are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies, and no savings institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally prohibits loans by public companies to their executive officers and directors. However, there is a specific exception for loans by financial institutions, such as the Bank, to its executive officers and directors that are made in compliance with federal banking laws. Under such laws, our authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors, and 10% or more shareholders (“insiders”), as well as entities such persons control, is limited. The law limits both the individual and aggregate amount of loans the Bank may make to insiders based, in part, on its capital position and requires certain board approval procedures to be followed. Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and cannot involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees.
Capital Distribution Limitations. Regulations applicable to the Bank impose limitations upon all capital distributions by savings associations, like cash dividends, payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares, payments to stockholders of another institution in a cash-out merger and other distributions charged against capital. Under these regulations, a savings association may, in circumstances described in those regulations:

• | Be required to file an application and await approval from the OCC before it makes a capital distribution;


• | Be required to file a notice 30 days before the capital distribution; or


• | Be permitted to make the capital distribution without notice or application to the OCC.

Community Reinvestment Act and the Fair Lending Laws. Savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations of the OCC to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. An institution’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the denial of applications. In addition, an institution’s failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in the OCC, other federal regulatory agencies or the Department of Justice, taking enforcement 
actions against the institution. In the most recent Community Reinvestment Act Report, issued May 2019, the Bank received a ‘Satisfactory’ rating covering calendar years 2016, 2017, and 2018. To the best of our knowledge, Axos Bank continues to maintain full compliance with each of the Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act and we do not anticipate the Bank becoming the subject of any enforcement actions.
Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB system. Among other benefits, each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. Each FHLB is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. Each FHLB makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the individual FHLB. As an FHLB member, the Bank is required to own capital stock in a Federal Home Loan Bank in specified amounts based on either its aggregate outstanding principal amount of its residential mortgage loans, home purchase contracts and similar obligations at the beginning of each calendar year or its outstanding advances from the FHLB.
Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions to maintain non-interest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts (primarily checking, negotiable order of withdrawal (“NOW”), and Super NOW checking accounts) and non-personal time deposits. At June 30, 2019, the Bank was in compliance with these requirements.
Activities of Subsidiaries. A savings association seeking to establish a new subsidiary, acquire control of an existing company or conduct a new activity through a subsidiary must provide 30 days prior notice to the FDIC and the OCC and conduct any activities of the subsidiary in compliance with regulations and orders of the OCC. The OCC has the power to require a savings association to divest any subsidiary or terminate any activity conducted by a subsidiary that the OCC determines to pose a serious threat to the financial safety, soundness or stability of the savings association or to be otherwise inconsistent with sound banking practices.
Consumer Laws and Regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB in order to regulate any person who offers or provides personal, family or household financial products or services. The CFPB is an independent “watchdog” within the Federal Reserve System to enforce and create “Federal consumer financial laws.” Banks as well as nonbanks are subject to any rule, regulation or guideline created by the CFPB. Congress established the CFPB to create one agency in charge of protecting consumers by overseeing the application and implementation of “Federal consumer financial laws,” which includes (i) rules, orders and guidelines of the CFPB, (ii) all consumer financial protection functions, powers and duties transferred from other federal agencies, such as the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and (iii) a long list of consumer financial protection laws enumerated in the Dodd-Frank Act, such as the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Consumer Leasing Act of 1976, the Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act of 1982, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Truth in Lending Act and the Truth in Savings Act, among many others. The CFPB has broad examination and enforcement authority, including the power to issue subpoenas and cease and desist orders, commence civil actions, hold investigations and hearings and seek civil penalties, as well as the authority to regulate disclosures, mandate registration of any covered person and to regulate what it considers unfair, deceptive, abusive practices.
Depository institutions with more than $10 billion in assets and their affiliates are subject to direct supervision by the CFPB, including any applicable examination, enforcement and reporting requirements the CFPB may establish. As of June 30, 2019, we had $11.2 billion in total assets, placing the Bank under the direct supervision and oversight of the CFPB. The laws and regulations of the CFPB and other consumer protection laws and regulations to which the Bank is subject mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which we must deal with customers when taking deposits from, making loans to, or engaging in other types of transactions with, our customers.
A section of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly referred to as the Durbin amendment, reduced the level of interchange fees that could be charged by institutions with greater than $10 billion in total assets. The exemption for small issuers ceases to apply as of July 1st of the year following the calendar year in which the issuer has total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more at year-end. Since we have grown to hold total assets in excess of $10 billion beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2019, the Durbin amendment may reduce the amount of interchange fees that we can charge and could adversely affect our fee-sharing prepaid card partnerships, such as with H&R Block.
Privacy Standards. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) modernized the financial services industry by establishing a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks, insurance companies, securities firms and other financial service providers. The Bank is subject to OCC regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of the GLBA. These regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including informing consumers of its information sharing practices and informing consumers of their rights to opt out of certain practices.
Anti-Money Laundering and Customer Identification. The U.S. government enacted the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA PATRIOT Act”) on October 26, 2001 in response to the terrorist events of September 11, 2001. The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government broad powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. In February 2010, Congress re-enacted certain expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act.
REGULATION OF SECURITIES BUSINESS
In early 2019, we acquired COR Clearing, LLC (now Axos Clearing LLC), a correspondent clearing firm for broker-dealers, and the WiseBanyan entities, an introducing broker and a registered investment adviser. The correspondent clearing firm and introducing broker are broker-dealers registered with the SEC and members of FINRA and various other self-regulatory organizations. Axos Clearing also uses various clearing organizations, including the Depository Trust Company, the National Securities Clearing Corporation, and the Options Clearing Corporation. 
Broker-dealers are subject to extensive laws, rules and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices, public offerings, publication of research reports, use and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping and reporting, the conduct of directors, officers, and employees, qualification and licensing of supervisory and sales personnel, marketing practices, supervisory and organizational procedures intended to ensure compliance with securities laws and to prevent improper trading on material nonpublic information, limitations on extensions of credit in securities transactions, clearance and settlement procedures, and rules designed to promote high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade. Broker-dealers are also regulated by state securities administrators in those jurisdictions where they do business. Regulators may conduct periodic examinations and review reports of our operations, performance, and financial condition. Our margin lending is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board’s restrictions on lending in connection with client purchases and short sales of securities, and FINRA rules also require our broker-dealers to impose maintenance requirements based on the value of securities contained in margin accounts. The rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which are enforced by the SEC and FINRA, apply to the municipal securities activities of Axos Clearing.
Violations of laws, rules and regulations governing a broker-dealer’s actions could result in censure, penalties and fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, the restriction, suspension, or expulsion from the securities industry of such broker-dealer, its registered representatives, officers or employees, or other similar adverse consequences. 
Significant new rules and regulations continue to arise as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the implementation of a more stringent fiduciary standard for broker-dealers and increased regulation of investment advisors. Compliance with these provisions could result in increased costs. Moreover, to the extent the Dodd-Frank Act affects the operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital requirements of financial institutions with whom we do business, those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs, reduce their capacity to transact, or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with us. 
Limitation on Businesses. The businesses that our broker-dealers may conduct are limited by its agreements with, and its oversight by, FINRA, other regulatory authorities and federal and state law. Participation in new business lines, including trading of new products or participation on new exchanges or in new countries often requires governmental and/or exchange approvals, which may take significant time and resources. In addition, our broker-dealers are operating subsidiaries of Axos, which means its activities are further limited by those that are permissible for subsidiaries of financial holding companies, and as a result, may be prevented from entering new businesses that may be profitable in a timely manner, if at all. 
Net Capital Requirements. The SEC, FINRA and various other regulatory authorities have stringent rules and regulations with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by regulated entities. Rule 15c3-1 of the Exchange Act (the “Net Capital Rule”) requires that a broker-dealer maintain minimum net capital. Generally, a broker-dealer’s net capital is net worth plus qualified subordinated debt less deductions for non-allowable (or non-liquid) assets and other adjustments and operational charges. At June 30, 2019, our broker-dealers were in compliance with applicable net capital requirements. 
The SEC, CFTC, FINRA and other regulatory organizations impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined thresholds. These rules also dictate the ratio of debt-to-equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer, and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. If a broker-dealer fails to maintain the required net capital, it may be subject to penalties and other regulatory sanctions, including suspension or revocation of registration by the SEC or applicable regulatory authorities, and suspension or expulsion by these regulators could ultimately lead to the broker-dealer’s liquidation. Additionally, the Net Capital Rule and certain FINRA rules impose requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to, and approval from, the SEC and FINRA for certain capital withdrawals. 
Compliance with the net capital requirements may limit our operations, requiring the intensive use of capital. Such rules require that a certain percentage of our assets be maintained in relatively liquid form and therefore act to restrict our ability to withdraw capital from our broker-dealer entities, which in turn may limit our ability to pay dividends, repay debt or redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding common stock. Any change in such rules or the imposition of new rules affecting the scope, coverage, calculation or amount of capital requirements, or a significant operating loss or any unusually large charge against capital, could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, repay debt, meet our debt covenant requirements or to expand or maintain our operations. In addition, such rules may require us to make substantial capital contributions into one or more of the our broker-dealers in order for such subsidiaries to comply with such rules, either in the form of cash or subordinated loans made in accordance with the requirements of all applicable net capital rules. 
Customer Protection Rule.  Our broker-dealers that hold customers’ funds and securities are subject to the SEC’s customer protection rule (Rule 15c3-3 under the Exchange Act), which generally provides that such broker-dealers maintain physical possession or control of all fully-paid securities and excess margin securities carried for the account of customers and maintain certain reserves of cash or qualified securities. 
Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”). Our broker-dealers are subject to the Securities Investor Protection Act and belong to SIPC, whose primary function is to provide financial protection for the customers of failing brokerage firms. SIPC provides protection for customers up to $500,000, of which a maximum of $250,000 may be in cash. 
Anti-Money Laundering. Our broker-dealers must also comply with the USA PATRIOT Act and other rules and regulations, including FINRA requirements, designed to fight international money laundering and to block terrorist access to the U.S. financial system. We are required to have systems and procedures to ensure compliance with such laws and regulations. 
Investment Advisor. As an investment advisor registered with the SEC, our subsidiary Axos Invest, Inc. (doing business as “WiseBanyan”) is subject to the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (together, the “Advisers Act”), including examination by the SEC’s staff. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, performance fees, maintaining an effective compliance program, solicitation arrangements, conflicts of interest, advertising, limitations on agency and principal transactions between the advisor and advisory clients, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, and general anti-fraud provisions. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment advisor’s registration. Investment advisors also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Failure to comply with the Advisers Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, profit disgorgement, fines or other similar consequences against us.
Volcker Rule. Provisions of the Volcker Rule and the final rules implementing the Volcker Rule also restrict certain activities provided by the our broker-dealers, including proprietary trading and sponsoring or investing in “covered funds.” 
Our broker-dealers are broker-dealers registered with the SEC, FINRA, all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Much of the regulation of broker-dealers, however, has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations, principally FINRA, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and national securities exchanges. These self-regulatory organizations adopt rules (which are subject to approval by the SEC) for governing its members and the industry. Broker-dealers are also subject to federal securities laws and SEC rules, as well as the laws and rules of the states in which a broker-dealer conducts business. Our broker-dealers are members of, and are primarily subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by FINRA. 
The regulations to which broker-dealers are subject cover all aspects of the securities business, including, but not limited to, sales and trade practices, net capital requirements, record keeping and reporting procedures, relationships and conflicts with customers, the handling of cash and margin accounts, experience and training requirements for certain employees, the conduct of investment banking and research activities and the conduct of registered persons, directors, officers and employees. Broker-dealers are also subject to the privacy and anti-money laundering laws and regulations discussed herein. Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by the SEC, securities exchanges, or self-regulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules often directly affect the method of operation and profitability of broker-dealers. The SEC, securities exchanges, self-regulatory organizations and states may conduct administrative and enforcement proceedings that can result in censure, fine, suspension or expulsion of broker-dealers, their registered persons, officers or employees. The principal purpose of regulation and discipline of broker-dealers is the protection of customers and the securities markets rather than protection of creditors and stockholders of broker-dealers.
