Our Company
Vera Bradley is a leading designer of women’s handbags, luggage and travel items, fashion and home accessories, and unique gifts. Founded in 1982 by friends Barbara Bradley Baekgaard and Patricia R. Miller in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the brand’s innovative designs, iconic patterns, and brilliant colors continue to inspire and connect women. 
Vera Bradley offers a unique multi-channel sales model, as well as a focus on service and a high level of customer engagement. The Company sells its products through two reportable segments: Direct and Indirect. The Direct business consists of sales of Vera Bradley products through the Company’s full-line and factory outlet stores in the United States; verabradley.com; the Company’s online outlet site; and the Company’s annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne. As of February 2, 2019, the Company operated 99 full-line stores and 57 factory outlet stores. The Indirect business consists of sales of Vera Bradley products to approximately 2,300 specialty retail locations, department stores, national accounts, third-party e-commerce sites, and third-party inventory liquidators, as well as royalties recognized through licensing agreements. For financial information about our reportable segments, refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this report.
Our History
Barbara Bradley Baekgaard and Patricia Miller founded the Company in 1982 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, after recognizing a lack of stylish travel accessories in the market. Within weeks, the friends created Vera Bradley, named after Ms. Bradley Baekgaard’s mother, and began manufacturing and marketing their distinctive products. The founders, together with past and present members of the executive management team, have been instrumental in our growth and success. The following timeline sets forth a summary of some milestones in Vera Bradley’s history by calendar year:

The passion for design and customer service established by our founders has driven our Company for over 30 years and remains the cornerstone of Vera Bradley today. Ms. Baekgaard continues to focus on various Vera Bradley-related projects. Ms. Miller retired in October 2012 as our National Spokesperson, but continues to serve on the Board of Directors along with Ms. Baekgaard.
Vision 20/20 Initiatives
During fiscal 2018, we launched “Vision 20/20” which is an aggressive plan to turnaround our business and restore brand and Company health by the end of fiscal 2021. Integrating our Vision 20/20 initiatives into our long-term strategic plan is expected to lay the foundation for growth, a more profitable future, and continued strong cash flows. 
During fiscal 2019, the key focus areas of Vision 20/20 were moving to a significantly less clearance-driven business model and increasing full-price selling, meaningfully reducing selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses and cost of sales expenses, maximizing retention of our customer base, and driving cash flow from operations.
Clearance Reduction, Product Offerings, and Assortment Guardrails. To move to a significantly less clearance driven business model, we focused on three key product and pricing initiatives: reducing the amount of clearance merchandise offered, narrowing our current product offerings, and introducing tighter assortment guardrails. 
During fiscal 2019, we significantly reduced the amount of clearance merchandise offered on verabradley.com and in our full-line stores to reset our customers’ pricing expectations and restore our full-price business. To reduce certain clearance sales from verabradley.com, we began the use of our online outlet site in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. This site is marketed to certain members of our customer base. During fiscal 2019, we reduced our clearance activity on verabradley.com and our full-line stores by approximately 70% and increased comparable full-price selling in these two channels by over 20%.

We are continuing to focus on our best categories and narrowing our current product offering by eliminating unproductive or incongruent categories and SKUs from our assortments. We began to narrow our product offerings in fiscal 2018 and discontinued our fragrance and jewelry collections in the spring of fiscal 2019.
We have built tighter assortment guardrails around introducing new categories, patterns, and pricing, assuring the right fit for our brand and that our products not only provide thoughtful solutions but also reflect our signature attributes of being comfortable, casual, and affordable.
These product and pricing initiatives negatively affected revenues in fiscal 2019, but we believe these are the right actions to take for the future health of our business.
Expense Reduction. We also continued to reduce SG&A and cost of sales expenses. SG&A expense reductions began in fiscal 2018 by right-sizing our corporate and retail store infrastructure to align with the size of our business. These initiatives continued into fiscal 2019 where we continued to identify corporate efficiencies, closely monitored our marketing spending to ensure our return was optimized, and reduced store operating expenses by closing ten full-line stores. We have closed a total of 15 underperforming full-line stores and one underperforming factory outlet store since the beginning of fiscal 2018 and forecast that we will close up to an additional 30 full-line stores by the end of fiscal 2022, primarily as leases expire. 
Our reduced level of clearance activity, combined with other efforts in sourcing and distribution, drove a meaningful year-over-year gross margin rate improvement.
Customer Retention. While, as expected, our overall customer count was down in the mid-single digit range for the fiscal year due to the dramatic reduction in clearance promotions and lower than anticipated factory traffic, the customer count in our full-line stores and on verabradley.com exceeded our expectations. In addition, a higher percentage of new customers entered the brand through full-price purchasing.
Driving Cash Flows. During fiscal 2019, we generated operating cash flow of $43.6 million and increased our cash and investment position by nearly $20 million compared to the prior-year period, while completing over $16 million in share repurchases. 
Growth Strategies
Our long-term vision is to build on the Company's rich heritage and establish Vera Bradley as a premium global lifestyle brand, expand our customer reach, and grow our customer connections. Our long-term strategic plan, integrated with Vision 20/20, is centered upon the three planks of product, distribution, and marketing.
We are focused on creating thoughtful solutions for our customers and believe we have a great opportunity to attract more customers to our brand through our product offerings, our distribution channels, and our marketing efforts.
Product. We have identified four key businesses where we can offer our customers thoughtful solutions that we believe will propel our future growth. We are continuing to optimize our existing core portfolio by eliminating product categories and specific SKUs that are unproductive or incongruent, as well as expanding into relevant new categories that reflect our brand and signature attributes of comfortable, casual, and affordable. We will continue to use licenses and strategic partnerships as appropriate to expand our product categories.

• | Our Fashion Bag and Accessories business continues to be our largest opportunity and allows us to highlight our innovation, function, and fashion. Both patterns and solids are important in this category.


• | Travel remains a core differentiator for Vera Bradley and allows us to both embrace our heritage and to showcase newness and functionality with products like Lighten Up and our unique collapsible luggage.


• | Our Campus business including backpacks, has been successful, and we believe there are further opportunities to expand our Campus authority going forward.


• | We believe Home can continue to be a significant growth opportunity for Vera Bradley, with market attractiveness and a great brand fit. Licensing will continue to play a key role in the home area.

In each of these areas, fabric, pattern innovation, and newness remain critical in staying relevant. 
Distribution Channels. Vera Bradley products are available through our Direct channel including full-line and factory outlet stores, online through verabradley.com and our online outlet site, and our annual outlet sale, as well as through the Indirect channel including department and specialty retail stores, national accounts, third-party e-commerce sites, and third-party inventory liquidators. We continue to focus on tightly integrating our multi-channel business by strengthening and right-sizing both our Direct and Indirect distribution channels. 
In 2007 and 2009, we opened our first full-line and factory outlet stores, respectively. We believe there continues to be long-term opportunities for new stores throughout the United States. We opened six new factory outlet stores in fiscal 2019 and

suspended full-line store growth. We have closed a total of 15 underperforming full-line stores and one underperforming factory outlet store since the beginning of fiscal 2018 and forecast that we will close up to an additional 30 full-line stores by fiscal 2022, primarily as leases expire.
We plan to open six new factory outlet stores in fiscal 2020. At February 2, 2019, over 95% of the product in the outlet channel was made specifically for our factory outlet stores.
In 2006, we began selling directly to consumers through verabradley.com. Building our digital flagship remains a key part of our distribution strategy. As part of the Company's Vision 20/20 initiatives, we created an online outlet site during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to allow us to reduce clearance sales from verabradley.com. In fiscal 2019, we had approximately 44 million visits to our website and our online outlet site.
Our department store relationships allow us to expose our brand to new customers and showcase new product assortments. We are currently in approximately 560 department store locations, including Dillard’s, Macy’s, Belk, and Von Maur. In the department stores, we are continuing to work on enhancing our brand presentation and to explore expansion of our lifestyle brand offerings.
The specialty retail channel is the heritage of our business and remains important to us. We continue to add select accounts while discontinuing unproductive accounts. While the specialty retail business is becoming a smaller percentage of our total revenue base, we are working to stabilize it by assisting retailers with optimizing their businesses. 
Marketing. Marketing and brand positioning are both critical elements as we continue to engage new consumers and strengthen our bond with existing customers.
We activated our new branding and brand positioning in fiscal 2017, which included updating elements of our visual identity such as our logo. We continued to increase our brand awareness in fiscals 2018 and 2019 through our “digital first” strategy by partnering with key influencers and leveraging social media channels. During fiscal 2019, we emphasized marketing on our full-price offerings and less on our clearance and sale.
Well-timed and well-executed brand activation is critical to increasing our brand relevancy and increasing purchase intent.  Through comprehensive consumer research, we have designed a media plan that we believe effectively targets our customers and attracts both lapsed and new consumers to our brand. Our media efforts include a fully-integrated mix of digital, social, experiential, and print, with our goal being to surround consumers with our brand.
Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths differentiate us within the marketplace:
Strong Brand Identity and Positioning. We believe the Vera Bradley brand is highly recognized for its distinctive and vibrant style. Vera Bradley is positioned in the market as a lifestyle brand that inspires consumers to express their femininity, individuality, and sense of style. We have also positioned our brand to highlight the high quality and functional attributes of our products. The Vera Bradley brand is more price accessible than many competing brands, which allows us to attract a wide range of consumers and increases our ability to achieve more frequent purchases.
Customer Loyalty. The Vera Bradley brand is authentic and has a deep connection with its customers. We believe we have a segment of long-term consumers who act as loyal and enthusiastic brand advocates. We believe this enthusiasm for our brand by our loyal customers inspires repeat purchases. Our customers often purchase our products as gifts for family members and friends, who we strive to turn into brand enthusiasts. 
Product Development Expertise. Our product development team combines an understanding of consumer preferences with a knowledge of color, fashion, and style trends to design our products. Our creative design associates utilize a disciplined product design process that seeks to maximize the productivity of our product releases, including our print designs, and drive consumer demand.
Dynamic Multi-Channel Distribution Model. We offer our products through a diverse choice of shopping options across channels that are intimate, highly shop-able, fun, and characteristic of our brand. Whether they visit a Vera Bradley store, specialty retail store, department store, or verabradley.com, we believe consumers can find the brand in places that match their unique shopping interests. Our multi-channel distribution model enables us to maximize customer access to our products.

Unique Company Culture. We were founded in 1982 by two friends, Barbara Bradley Baekgaard and Patricia Miller, who built our business around their passion for design and commitment to customer service. We believe our founders created a unique culture that attracts passionate and motivated employees who are excited about our products and our brand. Our employees share our founders’ commitment to Vera Bradley customers and to the Company’s core values of Kindness, Ingenuity, Thoughtfulness, Optimism, Tenacity, and Empathy. We believe that a fun, friendly, and welcoming work environment fosters creativity and collaboration. By empowering our employees to become personally involved in product design, testing, and marketing, they become passionate and devoted brand advocates.
Experienced Management Team. Our senior management team has extensive experience across a diverse range of disciplines in product design, merchandising, marketing, store operations and development, supply chain management, and finance. 
Our Product Release Strategy 
We introduce new collections monthly. Each launch typically consists of one to three signature cotton-quilted prints, as well as other fabrications including microfiber, leather, Lighten Up, and Midtown, many of which are also available in solid colors. These collections of prints and solids are incorporated into the designs of a wide range of products, including bags, accessories, and travel items. These collections typically include classic styles, updates to existing designs, and new product introductions.
To keep our assortment current and fresh, and to focus our inventory investments on our best performers, we discontinue prints and fabrications as necessary. We sell our remaining inventory of retired products primarily through our website (including our online outlet site), factory outlet stores, annual outlet sale, and third-party liquidators.
Our Products
The following chart presents net revenues generated by each of our four product categories and other revenues as a percentage of our total net revenues for fiscals 2019, 2018, and 2017.

Bags. Bags are a core part of our product offerings and are the primary component of every seasonal assortment. The category consists of classic and new styles developed by our product development team. Our bag product category includes items such as totes, crossbodies, satchels, clutches, backpacks, baby bags, and lunch bags. Bags play a prominent role in our visual merchandising, and we showcase the different fabrications, patterns, colors, and features of each bag.
Travel. Our travel product category includes rolling luggage, cosmetics, travel and packing accessories, and travel bags which includes our iconic duffel and weekend bags. The first Vera Bradley product offering included duffel bags, which have consistently been strong performers. We believe their popularity, as well as the appeal of our other travel items, results from our vibrant designs, functional styles, and lightweight fabrications.
Accessories. Accessories include fashion accessories such as wallets, wristlets, eyeglass cases, scarves, and various technology accessories. Our accessories are attractively priced and allow the consumer to include some color in her wardrobe, even if tucked into another bag. Our product development team consistently updates the accessories assortment based on consumer demand and fashion trends.
Home. Our home category includes textiles, including throw blankets, beach towels, and comforters, as well as items such as mugs and tumblers.

Product Development 
We have implemented a fully integrated and cross-functional product development process that aligns design, trend and market research, merchandising, planning, sales, marketing, and sourcing. Product development is a core capability that makes our products unique. Our designs and aesthetics set our products apart and drive customer loyalty. Our design and product development teams combine an understanding of the needs of our target customers, with knowledge of upcoming color, material, consumer, and fashion trends to design new collections, as well as new product categories, which will resonate in the market.
We typically begin the development stage of our products in the Vera Bradley portfolio twelve to eighteen months in advance of their release. The development of each new pattern includes the design of a primary print and sometimes a secondary coordinating print. All print development is managed by our internal print design team. Once developed, we generally copyright our patterns as appropriate. We believe that great design is not only central to our product, but also is a fundamental part of our brand development and growth strategies.
Our design team works to ensure that new collections contain an assortment of products and styles that are in line with both trends and customer needs and regularly updates classic styles to enhance functionality. Our team monitors fashion trends and customer needs by attending major trend and industry shows in Europe, Asia, and the United States, subscribing to trend monitoring services, and engaging in comparison-shopping.
Our product development team works closely with our marketing and merchandising teams to gather consumer insights through a variety of methodologies, including seasonal market research, in-store testing, scheduled interviews, and online and in-person surveys conducted by our internal team. The design and product development teams ensure that we offer products that are constructed to meet our design, function, construction, and quality standards in a cost-effective manner. We believe that with our cross-functional, collaborative approach, we are able to introduce and market our products in a way that clearly communicates the Vera Bradley brand.
In addition to products developed in-house, we also pursue brand extensions through strategic partnerships, licensing agreements, and brand collaborations. We currently have licenses in place for eyewear, collegiate, bedding, hosiery, swimwear, technology accessories, stationery, health care uniforms and accessories, sleepwear and loungewear, and bath collections. We will continue to look for the right strategic partners and licensees that can augment the brand and provide established distribution networks for certain categories of business.
Marketing 
We believe that the growth of our brand and our business is influenced by our ability to introduce and sell our merchandise in a way that clearly conveys the Vera Bradley brand personality. We use marketing as a critical tool in our efforts to promote our brand.
Retention Advertising. Vera Bradley communicates with our established customers consistently throughout the year with regular e-mails, social media, and seasonal direct mail catalogs, brochures, and notifications. Our retention advertising is geared to keeping Vera Bradley top of mind with our customers, rewarding our customers, and providing them with news of our seasonal launches and new product introductions. 
New Customer Acquisition Advertising. We primarily employ digital (i.e., display banner, mobile, geo-targeting, and pre-roll video) and print advertising to increase overall brand awareness and attract new customers. Our advertisements are placed in fashion, lifestyle, and family publications and websites that complement the wide breadth of appeal of our brand. Our ads have recently appeared in StyleWatch, InStyle, Glamour, Cosmopolitan, Vogue, Elle, and O the Oprah Magazine.
Public Relations and Product Placement. Vera Bradley has received considerable editorial exposure in the press, with mentions in O the Oprah Magazine, Magnolia Journal, Garden & Gun, InStyle, and Southern Living. In addition, we have expanded our public relations efforts to reach popular online influencers and bloggers.
Product placement in feature-length films and on prime-time television shows remains strong with television placements in Modern Family, The Big Bang Theory, Blackish, Speechless, and American Housewife. Movie placements include: Pitch Perfect 3, La La Land, Girl's Trip, Baywatch, A Bad Moms Christmas, and Den of Thieves.
Partnerships. During fiscal 2019, we partnered with the non-profit organization “Blessings in a Backpack” and a variety of celebrity co-hosts to provide carnival themed charity events at seven elementary schools across the country. We donated 25,000 backpacks filled with food supplies for children in need.

Social Media and Online Marketing. We use online marketing and social networking sites as tools to increase brand awareness and drive traffic to verabradley.com and to our stores. We have captured approximately 5.5 million active customer e-mail addresses in our online customer file, with many of these customers providing age, occupation, and location data. This information provides us with deeper insight into the products and categories that are of the highest interest to our customers, and allows us to better target our customers with appropriate messages. As of February 2, 2019, we had nearly 1.9 million Facebook fans and approximately 80,000 Twitter followers. Our Instagram, which we launched in October 2012, has grown to approximately 420,000 followers and is our most highly engaged social medium. In addition, we often partner with brand-right bloggers to promote product.
Direct Mail. Seasonal Vera Bradley catalogs are a vehicle for promoting our brand and product portfolio. Each catalog is sent to a targeted customer mailing list. In addition to distributing the catalog, we produce and distribute a number of other marketing pieces, including postcards and mini-mailers. We believe our direct mail medium generates excitement and awareness about the brand and seasonal introductions and allows us to reach both new and loyal customers in their homes.
Seasonality
Because Vera Bradley products are frequently given as gifts, we have historically realized, and expect to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of November and December. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. 
Channels of Distribution
We distribute our products through our Direct and Indirect segments. This multi-channel distribution model is designed to enable operational flexibility and maximizes the methods by which we can access potential customers.
Direct Segment
Full-Line Stores. We have developed a retail presence through our full-line stores, all located in the United States, which provides us with a format to showcase our brand and the full array of Vera Bradley products. As of February 2, 2019, we operated 99 full-line stores averaging approximately 1,900 square feet per store. In fiscal 2017, we opened our first flagship store in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City which offers customers a unique store experience, as well as exclusive product. Our sales associates are passionate about our products and customer service, which, we believe, translates into a superior shopping experience.
Factory Outlet Stores. Our factory outlet stores are a vehicle for selling factory exclusive styles, as well as retired merchandise at discounted prices, while maintaining brand integrity. At the end of fiscal 2019, over 95% of the merchandise found in our factory outlet stores consisted of factory exclusive styles. Factory outlet stores are an integral part of our distribution strategy, as this format provides an additional channel of distribution for our products and enables us to better target value-oriented customers. Our factory outlet stores average approximately 3,200 square feet per store. As of February 2, 2019, we operated 57 factory outlet stores, all located in the United States.
Store Location Selection Strategy. Our store location decisions for both full-line and factory outlet stores are made based upon our comprehensive retail strategy that includes actual and planned penetration in both Indirect and Direct segments, as well as existing e-commerce demand. At this time, we do not believe all geographical markets have been fully penetrated by our distribution channels. We believe that long-term expansion of our store base will increase brand awareness and reinforce our brand image. In addition to analyzing store economics, we pay particular attention to the location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and co-tenancies. Along with seeking co-tenants that we believe share our target customer, we seek a balanced mix of moderate and high-end retailers to encourage high levels of traffic. Our target full-line store size is approximately 1,800 square feet and our target factory outlet store size is approximately 3,500 square feet.
Store Operations. The focus of our store operations is providing consumers with a comfortable and memorable shopping experience. We strive to make the experience interactive through special store events, such as showcasing newly launched products or celebrating our namesake’s birthday. Our customer service philosophy emphasizes friendly service, merchandise knowledge, and passion for the brand. Consequently, an essential requirement for the success of our stores is our ability to attract, train, and retain talented, highly motivated district managers, store managers, and sales associates. 
10

Store Economics. We expect our full-line stores to average approximately 1,800 square feet per store, and we expect to invest approximately $0.4 million per new store, consisting of inventory, pre-opening costs, and build-out costs, less tenant-improvement allowances.
We expect our factory outlet stores to average approximately 3,200 square feet per store, and we expect to invest approximately $0.5 million per new store, consisting of inventory, pre-opening costs, and build-out costs, less tenant-improvement allowances.
E-Commerce. In 2006, we began selling our products through the verabradley.com website. The objective of verabradley.com is to provide both a mechanism for marketing directly to consumers and a storefront where consumers can find the entire full-line Vera Bradley collection. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we created an online outlet site to reduce clearance sales from verabradley.com. We continue to assess our website for potential upgrades and enhancements, ensuring optimal design and performance. We had approximately 44 million visits to verabradley.com and our online outlet site during fiscal 2019.
Annual Outlet Sale. Our annual outlet sale is held in the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum Exposition Center in Fort Wayne, Indiana each spring. The annual outlet sale is an important tradition for Vera Bradley, has many loyal followers, and is an opportunity for us to sell our retired merchandise at discounted prices in a brand-right fashion. We attracted over 45,000 attendees to our 2018 annual outlet sale.
Indirect Segment
As of February 2, 2019, we sold our products in approximately 2,300 specialty retail locations, as well as department stores, national accounts, third party e-commerce sites, and third-party inventory liquidators, as well as through licensing agreements. In fiscal 2012, we launched our products in the department store channel. We are currently in approximately 560 department store locations, including Dillard's, Macy's, Belk, and Von Maur. 
The top 30% of our specialty retailers account for approximately 70% of total specialty retailer revenue. No single Indirect retailer represented more than 10% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2019, with the top ten Indirect retailers representing in the aggregate approximately 40% of total Indirect net revenues. The majority of our Indirect retailers have been customers for over five years. 
Indirect Sales Force 
We believe that having a combination of an in-house field sales force and a third-party agency, covering certain geographies, results in a more consistent brand presentation and messaging, enhanced support for our Indirect customers, and a more predictable, scalable, and cost-efficient business model. As of February 2, 2019, our in-house sales team consisted of approximately 25 full-time sales consultants. Beginning in fiscal 2019, the compensation structure was based upon a full commission model.
In addition to acquiring new and growing existing accounts, our sales consultants serve as a support center for our Indirect customers by assisting and educating them in areas such as merchandising and visual presentation, marketing the brand, product selection, and inventory management. Our visual merchandising program provides our sales consultants with a framework to guide our Indirect customers regarding optimal product placement and display that is intended to reinforce the message that our brand is distinctive.
Manufacturing and Supply Chain Model 
Our multi-country manufacturing and supply chain model is designed to achieve efficient, timely, and accurate order fulfillment while maintaining appropriate levels of inventory.
Our manufacturing and sourcing strategy is part of the larger cross-functional product development process. The overall objective for our sourcing team is to build and sustain collaborative partnerships throughout our supply chain, with a focus on identifying appropriate countries and partners to manufacture our products. The sourcing team leverages its expertise in negotiation, relationship management, and change management to maintain a strong global supply chain. Our sourcing team also focuses on achieving the right mix of production sites to mitigate the risk of concentrated production, including potential incremental tariffs. During fiscal 2019, to assist in this risk mitigation, our sourcing team reduced our production in China from approximately 70% in fiscal 2018 to approximately 54% in fiscal 2019.
We strive to maintain the appropriate balance of inventory to enable us to provide a high level of service to our customers, including prompt and accurate delivery of our products. We have an active and nimble sales and operations planning process that helps us balance the supply and demand issues that we encounter in our business, optimize our inventory levels, and anticipate inventory needs. We have also integrated our planning, forecasting, and segmentation processes under one function called Merchandise Planning and Allocation.

Approximately half of our products are cotton-based. Our other fabrics include primarily nylon, polyester, microfiber, and leather. We source our materials from various suppliers in Asia, with the majority coming from China and South Korea. Our global sourcing team works with select suppliers enabling us to optimize the mix of cost, lead time, quality, and reliability within our global supply network. All of our suppliers must comply with our quality standards, and we use only a limited number of pre-approved suppliers who have demonstrated a commitment to delivering the highest quality products. In April 2016, we opened an office in Hong Kong to lead the global supply chain in Asia, including the oversight of sourcing and procurement.
The majority of our finished goods, not sourced through licenses or strategic partners, are manufactured by a variety of global manufacturers located primarily in China, Vietnam, Myanmar, and Cambodia. We are not dependent upon any single manufacturer for our products. When determining the size of orders placed with our manufacturers, we take into account forward-looking demand, lead times for specific products, current inventory levels, and minimum order quantity requirements. Overseas production has resulted in substantial cost savings and a reduction of capital investment. With the oversight of our office in Hong Kong and our independent contractors, we believe these financial benefits have been realized without sacrificing the level of quality inherent in our products or service to our customers.
Distribution Center
We own a 428,500 square-foot distribution center in Roanoke, Indiana. This automated, computerized facility allows Vera Bradley employees to receive information directly from the order-collection center and quickly identify the products and quantities necessary to fulfill a particular order. The facility’s technology enables us to accurately process and pack orders, as well as track shipments and inventory. We believe that our systems for the processing and shipment of orders from our distribution center have enabled us to improve our overall customer service through enhanced order accuracy and reduced turnaround time; however, we continue to assess our distribution center processes and technology to ensure optimal output.
Our products are shipped primarily via third-party common carriers to our stores, our Indirect retailers, and directly to our customers who purchase through our website. We believe we are positioned well to support the order fulfillment requirements of our business, including business generated through our website.
Management Information Systems 
We believe that high levels of automation and technology are essential to maintain our competitive position. We maintain computer hardware, applications, and networks to enhance and accelerate the design process, to support the sale and distribution of our products to our customers, and to improve the integration and efficiency of our operations. Our information systems are designed to provide, among other things, comprehensive order processing, production, accounting, and management information and analytics for the product development, retail, sales, marketing, distribution, finance, and human resources functions of our business. We continue to assess our on premise and cloud-based technology solutions to ensure we have the optimal solutions for our business.
Competition
We face strong competition in each of the product lines and markets in which we compete. We believe that all of our products are in similar competitive positions with respect to the number of competitors they face and the level of competition within each product line. Due to the number of different products we offer, it is not practicable for us to quantify the number of competitors we face. Our products compete with other branded products within their product categories and with private label products sold by retailers. In our Indirect business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers, and distributors of handbags, accessories, and other products for the limited space available for the display of such products to the consumer. Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business. In our Direct business, we compete against other independent retailers, department stores, catalog retailers, gift retailers, and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of similar products.
The market for handbags, in particular, is highly competitive. Our competitors include not only established companies that are expanding their production and marketing of handbags, but also frequent new entrants to the market. We directly compete with wholesalers and direct sellers of branded handbags and accessories.
In varying degrees, depending on the product category involved, we compete on the basis of design (aesthetic appeal), quality (construction), function, price point, distribution, and brand positioning. We believe that our primary competitive advantages are consumer recognition of our brand, customer loyalty, product development expertise, and our widespread presence through our multi-channel distribution model. Some of our competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names or have substantially greater financial, distribution, marketing, and other resources than we do. Further, we may face new

competitors and increased competition from existing competitors as we expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets.
Copyrights and Trademarks 
The development of new patterns includes the design of primary and secondary prints. Once developed, we generally copyright our patterns as appropriate. We currently have approximately 1,000 copyrights.
We also own the material trademark rights used in connection with the production, marketing, and distribution of all of our products, both in the United States and in the other countries in which our products are principally sold. Our trademarks include “Vera Bradley.” We aggressively police our trademarks and copyrights and pursue infringers and counterfeiters both domestically and internationally. Our trademarks will remain in existence for as long as we continue to use and renew them in advance of their expiration dates. We have no material patents.
Employees
As of February 2, 2019, we had approximately 2,620 employees. Of the total, approximately 2,045 were engaged in retail selling positions, approximately 280 were engaged in distribution, sourcing and quality functions, approximately 35 were engaged in product design, and approximately 260 were engaged in corporate support and administrative functions. None of our employees are represented by a union. We believe that our relations with our employees are good, and we have never encountered a significant work stoppage. 
Government Regulation
Many of our imported products are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs, or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the United States and other countries or impact the cost of such products. To date, we have not been restricted by quotas in the operation of our business, and customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of a majority of our products. In addition, we are subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions, including U.S. retaliation against prohibited foreign practices, with respect to our product sourcing and international sales operations.
We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental matters, including the handling, transportation, and disposal of our products and our non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, and groundwater. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties, or the imposition of other liabilities. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect upon our earnings or financial position. If we violate any laws or regulations, however, it could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance.
