ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Organization within the last five years.

On September 14, 2009, the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada. Until the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we were engaged in the business of acquisition, exploration and development of natural resource properties. On April 17, 2018, under the laws of the State of Nevada, we changed our name from “Lash, Inc.” to “Artisan Consumer Goods, Inc.” On October 19, 2016, under the laws of the State of Nevada, we changed our name from “Cassidy Ventures Inc.” to “Lash, Inc.” 

Amber Joy Finney has served as our President and Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer and sole director since September 28, 2016. Ms. Finney is also the holder of 2,271,429 shares of our common stock, amounting to 51.6% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. William Drury has served as our Secretary since February 19, 2013.

William Drury also served as our Treasurer and sole director from February 19, 2013, until September 28, 2016. Mr. Drury also served as our President from July 31, 2015 until September 28, 2016. Keith Fredricks served as our President from February 19, 2013 until July 31, 2015.

As of June 30, 2019, we were authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, and 25,000,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock, par vale $0.001 per share.

We have never earned any revenues.

Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement raising substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Our Business – and Immediate Need for Financing

We are in the business of branding, creating, sourcing and distributing artisan consumer packaged goods. The Company’s administrative offices are located at 297 President Street, Brooklyn, New York 11231. We do not conduct any operations at such address. The Company is looking for principal office space, appropriate for the Company’s stage of development. 

We require minimum funding of $87,300 for the next twelve months in order to implement our plan of business. After a twelve month period we may require additional financing. If we do not generate sufficient revenue, we may need a minimum of $21,825 additional funds to meet SEC filing requirements. Amber Finney, our President and sole director, has agreed to loan the Company funds. However, she has no firm commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the Company. If we do not generate sufficient revenue and Ms. Finney does not loan the Company funds, we intend to raise these additional funds through private debt or equity financing. We have not commenced any activities to raise these funds. We cannot provide any assurance that we will successfully raise this additional funding. We have no revenues and have incurred losses since inception.

In the event the Company is able to raise $87,300 in financing (or increments of 25%, 50% or 75% of $87,300), the Company plans to use the funds as follows:

Initial Focus of our Business

The company’s initial focus will be on achieving growth through aggressive product development and commercialization. Our long-term objective is to build a diverse portfolio of artisan consumer packaged brands. To meet this objective, the Company is currently engaging in concept development and analysis. We plan to begin production, market testing and commercialization of our brands as soon as we obtain financing.

The Company’s corporate website is planned to reside at ArtisanConsumerGoods.com. We have registered additional domains for certain products, however, we may choose not to use those domains pending market testing and other go-to-market strategy inputs.

We expect that the development and testing phase will take eight months to complete. We anticipate that it will take a further fourth months to see our products for sale online.

Consumer packaged goods (“CPG”), also sometimes classified as fast-moving consumer products, “FMCP,” are a category of goods consumed frequently by consumers. This category consists of goods that typically are replaced often (as compared to durable goods, which are used for extended periods of time). Examples of CPGs are personal hygiene, packaged food and drinks, clothing, makeup, tobacco, alcoholic beverages, and household cleaning products.

Artisan goods are by definition, made in a traditional or non-mechanized way using high-quality ingredients and are especially one that involves making things by hand.

Artisan goods are created using time tested techniques that have been passed down from craftsperson to craftsperson.

Often made in smaller quantities or “small batch,” we believe that today’s consumers have a desire, for higher quality, socially conscious, environmentally friendly, organic, table to table goods. We seek out the creation of products that are made in the artisan tradition and facilitates the making, marketing, packaging, and delivery of these products. We plan to focus on consumer driven packaging, delivery, and service.

Our Products and Services 

We plan to launch the Company with diverse product lines that address high-value consumer segments within our target audience. Some of our planned products are as follows: 
Salish Seasons 
SalishSeasons.com 

We plan on assembling a sampling of indigenous Salish flavors and spices. These spices will be packaged for individual sale and as a ”pantry starter gift pack” that is bundled with a spice rack. Indigenous Salish flavors are those that existed in the traditional harvest zone of the American Indian nations who inhabited the Northwest U.S.A. and Southwest Canada during the ingredients. They are gathered, grown, ground fresh, and packaged for sale in the Pacific Northwest. 
Heirloom Grove 
Heirloomgrove.com 

Our Heirloom Grove brand is planned to include sauces, jams, compotes, and other canned fruit products sourced from organic, world-renowned orchards and groves of Washington state. Product packaging and social media promotion of Heirloom Grove will connect consumers with real artisans and farmers and their communities. The stories behind the brand will highlight the fair trade practices of these farmers and artisans, in a stark and refreshing contrast to the practices of large-scale megafarms and agriculture conglomerates.
Carefully Cooked 
CarefullyCooked.com

We plan on developing a line of carefully produced and gourmet pantry starter foods. We envision these soups and baking mixes to be hand-crafted in small batches, using superior cooking methods and high-quality ingredients. Patience and attention to detail is what Carefully Cooked is all about. This product line will feature jarred artisan soups and boxed baking mixes of classic, timeless ”comfort food” flavors such as French Onion, Lobster Bisque, and Creamy Oyster Stew.

Herb Infused Coconut Oil 
(HerbInfusedCoconutoil.com, HerbCoconutoil.com, Coconutoilrefined.com)

Enjoy all the benefits of coconut oil without the coconut flavor. Our herb-infused, flavorless, and refined liquid coconut oils are a healthy alternative to traditional cooking oils, oil-based marinades and dressings. Naturally rich in medium chain triglycerides (”MCTs”) or medium chain fatty acids, our oils are more easily digested and processedin the liver than other fats. We believe that MCTs fuel the brain and body while creating a thermogenic effect, aiding in caloric burn. As a favorite feature of ketogenic diets, we believe that MTCs make it much easier to get into and stay in ketosis. 
Environmentally Safe, High-end Cleaning Products 

Our line of “earth-conscious” cleaning products offer artisan craftsmanship in an innovative package that is easy to transport, simple to use, and safe to store. Our distinctively fragranced, expert-crafted products are free of harsh chemicals such as ammonia, bleach, dyes, formaldehyde, parabens, & phthalates. Artisan Consumer Goods cleaning products are designed for the health and safety of our planet and its inhabitants. 
Quinoa Pilaf 
PilafQuinoa.com

Seasoned Quinoa dishes combine nutrition, convenience, and taste. Pairing the freshest high-quality seasonings, organic dried bone broths, vegetables, and nuts. With ethically-sourced, pre-washed, and delicious alternative to plain Quinoa, Artisan Consumer Goods takes the guesswork and time out of including this super seed into your diet. Native to western South America, protein and fiber rich Quinoa has been consumed for over 4,000 years, and is known today as an “ancient grain.” In fact, Quinoa is not a grain but a seed that provides 5 more grams of fiber and double the protein of rice, with a delightful crunch and a subtle nutty flavor. Sample Quinoa Pilaf flavors may include: Vegetable Medley, Mushroom, Shallot, Parmesan, Mediterranean, and Tomato Basil. 
The Market

Consumer packaged goods (“CPG”), also sometimes classified as fast-moving consumer products, are a category of goods consumed often by households and individuals. This category consists of goods that are replaced regularly, as compared to durable goods, like appliances or automobiles, which are used over longer periods of time). Some basic examples of CPGs are food and beverages, clothing, tobacco, and household products. 

CPGs are intended to be used quickly and are often sold at a relatively low cost. As the name implies, they usually come in some form of packaging that can be displayed on the shelves of retail businesses. 

Cosmetics are an example of a consumer packaged good. Like most CPGs, they typically have a limited shelf life; the product deteriorates over time or if exposed to temperature fluctuations. Sold in individual packages at fairly low prices, cosmetics like lipsticks, foundation, blush and eyeshadow are used daily, requiring frequent replenishment. 

Prospective Buyers of our Products

Our products will appeal to consumers who, when shopping for goods, seek additional emotional, psychological, or practical benefits, and are willing to pay for those benefits. April 2015 research from Deloitte found that consumers will pay premiums of between 19% and 33% for products with benefits such as: 


· | easier to use, carry, or store; 
--+---------------------------------------------
· | healthier version of a product; 
· | the option to customize or personalize; 
· | “craft” versions of food and beverages; 
· | a new, innovative product; and 
· | an improved version of an existing product.1

Our target consumers have higher-than-average discretionary incomes, but are focused on value when selecting products to purchase. They are loyal to brands with which they feel an emotional, or even an ideological, connection. When they evaluate premium-priced products, they consider the opinions of peers and trusted experts. They also endeavor to know the story behind the brand, and the journey the product took, from raw materials to the store shelf. 

Geographic Market Growth 

Our research has found that a thoughtful approach to geographic market selection will be an important element to the execution of our business plan. For example, in the United States, the overall compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of beer consumption is 1.1%. But many metropolitan markets (predominantly in the South and West) are seeing CAGR greater than 2%, with a handful of markets (like Prescott, Arizona) seeing CAGRs of over 3%.2

The variance in geographic market growth rates will play a central role in our go-to-market approach. For example, we will leverage geo-targeting capabilities of our online marketing vendors to ensure our marketing dollars are spent in growing markets with expanding populations of our target consumers. 

Nature of Competition 

The CPG market is highly competitive. This is primarily due to low consumer switching costs, and relatively low barriers to entry for suppliers. In 2016, there were 21,435 new product introductions in the food and beverage market in the U.S. This figure nearly doubles the quantity of new food and beverage product introductions in 1998, according to Mintel’s Global New Product Database (“GNPD”).3

In recent years, there has been a macro trend of small-to-midsize CPG companies taking share from large players. These large players lacked the incentive and the know-how to pursue market opportunities that did not meet certain thresholds for scalable revenue growth. 

April 2016 research from Information Resources Inc. and Boston Consulting Group found that ”U.S. sales of consumer packaged goods in 2015 rose by 3.1 percent, to $670 billion, a pace last achieved in 2012. It also found that small companies (less than $1 billion in sales) and midsized companies ($1 billion to $5 billion) accounted for 46.4 percent of total CPG sales, a 0.5 percentage-point gain since 2014, and 2.7 percentage point gain since 2011. That translates into a more than $18 billion shift in market share [from 2011 through 2015].”4

This success of smaller CPG firms at the expense of their larger rivals has not gone unnoticed. Many of the established incumbents have begun to invest in, or acquire outright, their smaller competitors. 

Market Size

The global market for consumer packaged goods is projected to grow from $8 trillion in 2014 to $14 trillion in 2025.5 The North American packaged foods market is projected to grow from $416.9 billion in 2014 to $440.3 billion in 2019.6 Although overall growth in recent years has been relatively slow in North America, significant growth exists in certain product categories, geographies, and distribution channels (or combinations of these).

We have not found any authoritative market sizing estimates for the artisan food category. We believe this is due to both category nascence and the lack of commonly-accepted industry definitions. 

Competition 

The level of competition in the artisan consumer packaged goods is extremely high. Many of our established competitors have developed a brand following which would make our potential customers prefer their products over ours. Economies of scale would make it easier for our larger established competitors to negotiate price discounts with their suppliers, which would leave us at a disadvantage. The principal competitive factors in our industry are public taste and diet, pricing and quality of food. We will be in a market where we compete with many domestic and international companies offering similar food products. We will be in direct competition with them. Many large companies will be able to provide their products through established distribution channels. Many of these companies may have a greater, more established customer base than we do. We will likely lose business to such companies. Also, many of these companies will be able to afford to offer better prices for similar food products as ours, which may also cause us to lose business. We foresee to continue to face challenges from new market entrants. We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

The Company has not yet entered the market and has no market penetration to date. The Company is aware of the following businesses, which may compete in the artisan consumer packaged goods business:

Bai Brands, LLC http://www.drinkbai.com/
Bai Brands, LLC is focused solely on the specialty beverage market. It was founded in 2009 and sold to Dr. Pepper Snapple Group in November 2016 for $1.7 billion. It continues to operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dr. Pepper Snapple Group. 

KIND Snacks http://www.kindsnacks.com/
KIND is a private company founded in 2004. In November 2017, it completed its first round of funding, led by Mars. In 2016, KIND was granted permission from the FDA to resume using the word ”healthy” on its product packaging; one year earlier, the FDA had evaluated KIND’s products as below the ”healthy” nutritional threshold). 

WhiteWave Foods http://www.whitewave.com/
Acquired by French conglomerate Danone in 2017 for $12.5B USD, the WhiteWave Foods Company engages in the manufacture, marketing, distribution, and sale of plant-based foods and beverages, coffee creamers and beverages, and dairy products in North America and Europe. We believe ACG differs from these competitors in two primary ways: 


· | We believe our ”online-first, telesales-second” distribution method will ultimately prove more efficient than resource-intensive “feet on the street” methods traditionally used in the CPG industry; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | We are building product diversification into our business model from inception. Diversification allows us to test a wider range of consumer markets. 


We believe the combination of diversification and efficient distribution will allow ACG to rapidly test our way into (or out of) new consumer markets, and operate more nimbly than our competition. We believe this ultimately will translate into greater shareholder value over time.

Marketing 

Branding and Packaging 

Because ACG is a purveyor of premium artisan products, manifestations of the brand will create and reinforce the consumer’s perception of quality, integrity and trustworthiness. We will communicate these positive brand attributes to consumers through: 

· | Products that work as advertised; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | High integrity in how we do business with consumers, retailers, and suppliers; and
· | Engaging and inviting packaging that reminds consumers of our focus on artisans. 


Below are some examples of how our packaging will support consumer perceptions of quality, integrity and trustworthiness: 


· | Use of matte finish versus gloss on paper and cardboard; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Use of packaging methods that demonstrate a human was involved in the assembly of the package;
· | Limited use of dyes and other packaging elements that are adverse to the environment; 
· | Clever and engaging copy writing; and 
· | Hand-written batch numbers and expiration dates. 

Go-To-Market Phase One: Online Distribution 

Phase One of our go-to-market will focus exclusively on establishing online distribution for our products. We will offer our products through leading consumer e-Commerce platforms and promote them through digital advertising and social media channels. 
Paid Media

Initially, we will concentrate our online marketing dollars on a small number of U.S. metropolitan areas with high densities of our target customers. As we grow our customer base, we will append our purchase data with additional demographic information, which we will sourced from third party consumer data firms. Analyzing these enriched data sets will help us answer two key go-to-market questions: 

· | Which metropolitan areas contain sufficiently high concentrations of “look-alikes” (e.g., consumers with similar demographic profiles to our customer base) to make these metro areas attractive targets for marketing investment.; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Within the markets we are currently targeting, where (e.g., at the ZIP/postal code or neighborhood level) should we focus our brick-and-mortar distribution efforts in Phase Two? 

Earned Media 

Connecting with our consumers through social media will be an important element of our business growth strategy. According to a recent study, approximately 71% of consumers who have had a good social media service experience with a brand are likely to recommend it to others.7 Another study of 1,000 consumers found that approximately 48% want to purchase from brands that are responsive to their customers on social media.8

For example every time we ship in order to Los Angeles, we should include a slip with the order encouraging the purchaser to share their purchase with local specific hashtags, such as hashtag Los Angeles Artisan Foods.

Go-To-Market Phase Two: Brick and Mortar

Phase Two of our go-to-market involves the following components: 

Retail Store Targeting 

We will leverage our third-party-enriched purchase data to create detailed demographic profiles of our customers (e.g., household income, age, discretionary spending) and their look-alikes within the markets we are currently targeting through online advertising. 

Within the geographies we are targeting with ad spend, we will then identify concentrations (e.g., cities, ZIP/postal codes, and neighborhoods) of our customers and their demographic look-alikes. 

We will then use third-party data sources to build target lists of retail locations in proximity to our customers ( and/or their demographic “look-alikes”) within markets currently targeted through online advertising. 

Finally, we will enable our telesales function to provide high-level insights to their retail distributors on how our products are selling, and what other products our high-value customers may be looking for when shopping for consumer staples. 

Sales 

Our company will focus on the distribution of small-batch consumer goods through direct-to-consumer channels and high-end brick-and-mortar retail locations. 

We expect revenue to come principally from three sources: 

Revenue derived from direct-to-consumer channels 

During Phase One of our go-to-market, we will sell through leading direct-to-consumer platforms such as Amazon.com and other platforms that reach our target audience. We will support the eCommerce channels with paid and earned (i.e., social) media. 

Revenue derived from brick-and-mortar channels 

Using insights from our direct-to-consumer efforts in Phase One, Phase Two will involve deployment of a centrally managed telesales, which will be responsible for:


· | Signing up new retailers - introductory call, market and consumer insight, business case, initial/trial order placement; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Onboarding new retailers - setting up ACG in retailer’s procurement process, setting up retailer in ACG order management process, training retailer on placing and receiving orders.; and 
· | Ongoing account management - helping existing retailers optimize sales of existing SKUs, introduce new SKUs, delivering market-level insights, and expanding the relationship (e.g., adding new store locations.


Revenue derived from emerging artisan products companies 

Once we have established the ACG brand, built our manufacturing hub, and created a network of online and offline distributors, we expect to become a launching platform for emerging artisan products. These firms will pay ACG upfront fees for access to our manufacturing hub and distributor network, and consultations on go-to-market strategy.Subsequent product sales will also be subject to revenue sharing agreement. 

Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchise restrictions and contractual obligations & concessions.

We have not entered into any franchise agreements or other contracts that have given, or could give rise to, obligations or concessions. We are planning to develop our website and intend to protect its contents by registering for appropriate copyright and trademark protection where our management deems such registration necessary or beneficial. We have not conducted any independent searches or other inquiry into patents or other intellectual property which may be owned by others and which may constrain our business plan, nor have we received independent opinions of counsel on such matters. Beyond our trade name, we do not hold any other intellectual property rights.


10

Compliance with Government Regulation

The FDA regulates all food and cosmetic product for sale for interstate commerce. We plan on complying with all regulations set forth by all governmental authorities and regulatory bodies for which we are responsible. We do not currently plan on registering an FDA facility and instead are planning on renting already registered. We do not currently plan on offering meat, poultry or egg products which would require regulation from the USDA. 

We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the construction and operation of any facility in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities.

We do not believe that government regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business, however, any government regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business and operating results.

Research and Development Activities and Costs

We have not incurred any research and development costs to date. We have plans to undertake certain research and development activities during the first 12 months following the date of this prospectus related to the development of our website.
Employees and Employment Agreements

Amber Finney, our President and a director, is our sole employee, and she currently works full time on Company matters. We have no agreement with Ms. Finney regarding her performance of duties for the Company. William Drury, our Secretary, serves solely in his capacity as Secretary and does not work on day-to-day Company operations.
Insurance 

We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a legal action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations. 
Facilities

We currently do not rent any real property or offices. Our current administrative business address is 297 President Street, Brooklyn, New York 11231. We do not conduct any operations at such address. The Company is looking for principal office space, appropriate for the Company’s stage of development, in Gold Bar, Washington.
