Products and Services Overview
 
Biopreservation Media
 
Stability (shelf life) and functional recovery are crucial aspects of academic research and clinical practice in the biopreservation of biologic-based source material, intermediate derivatives, and isolated/derived/expanded cellular products and therapies. Limited stability is especially critical in the regenerative medicine field, where harvested cells and tissues, if not maintained appropriately at normothermic body temperature (37ºC) or stored in a hypothermic state in an effective preservation medium, will lose viability over time. Chilling (hypothermia) is used to reduce metabolism and delay degradation of harvested cells, tissues, and organs. However, subjecting biologic material to hypothermic environments induces damaging molecular stress and structural changes. Although cooling successfully reduces metabolism (i.e., lowers demand for energy), various levels of cellular damage and death occur when using suboptimal methods. Traditional biopreservation media range from simple “balanced salt” (electrolyte) formulations to complex mixtures of electrolytes, energy substrates such as sugars, osmotic buffering agents and antibiotics. The limited stability which results from the use of these traditional biopreservation media formulations is a significant shortcoming that our optimized proprietary products address with great success.
 
Our scientific research activities over the last 20+ years enabled a detailed understanding of the molecular basis for the hypothermic and cryogenic (low-temperature induced) damage/destruction of cells through apoptosis and necrosis. This research led directly to the development of our HypoThermosol® FRS and CryoStor® technologies. Our proprietary preservation media products are specifically formulated to:
 

● | Minimize cell and tissue swelling
--+----------------------------------


● | Reduce free radical levels upon formation
--+------------------------------------------


● | Maintain appropriate low temperature ionic balances
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | Provide regenerative, high energy substrates to stimulate recovery upon warming
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Avoid the creation of an acidic state (acidosis)
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | Inhibit the onset of apoptosis and necrosis
--+--------------------------------------------

 
A key feature of our preservation media products is their “fully-defined” profile. All of our cGMP products are serum-free, protein-free and are formulated and filled using aseptic processing. We strive to use USP/Multicompendial grade or the highest quality available synthetic components. All of these features benefit prospective customers by facilitating the qualification process required to incorporate our products into their regulatory filings and hence patient delivery processes.
 
The results of independent testing demonstrate that our biopreservation media products significantly extend shelf-life and improve cell and tissue post-thaw viability and function, which may, in turn, improve clinical and commercial outcomes for existing and new cell and tissue therapy applications. Our products have demonstrated improved biopreservation outcomes for a broad array of cell and tissue types including stem cells isolated from umbilical and peripheral blood, bone marrow, adipose tissue, liver, tendon, and umbilical cord, in addition to T-cells, pluripotent stem cells including hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and neuronal cells, hepatocytes isolated from non-transplantable livers, chondrocytes isolated from cartilage, and dermal fibroblasts and muscle cells isolated from tissue biopsies.
 
Competing biopreservation media products are often formulated with simple isotonic media cocktails, animal serum, potentially a single sugar or human protein. A key differentiator of our proprietary HypoThermosol FRS formulation is the engineered optimization of the key ionic component concentrations for low temperature environments, as opposed to normothermic body temperature around 37°C, as found in culture media or saline-based isotonic formulas. Competing cryopreservation freeze media is often comprised of a single permeating cryoprotectant such as dimethyl sulfoxide (“DMSO”). Our CryoStor formulations incorporate multiple permeating and non-permeating cryoprotectant agents which allow for multiple mechanisms of protection and reduces the dependence on a single cryoprotectant.
 
Across a broad spectrum of cell and tissue types, our products have proven more effective in reducing post-preservation and post-thaw necrosis and apoptosis as compared to commercial and home-brew isotonic and extracellular formulations. This results in greatly extended shelf life and improved post-preservation viability.
 
Regenerative Medicine
 
The emerging field of regenerative medicine is unique in its aim to augment, repair, replace or regenerate organs and tissue that have been damaged by disease, injury or even the natural aging process. This rapidly evolving, interdisciplinary field is transforming healthcare by translating fundamental science into a variety of regenerative technologies including biologics, chemical compounds, materials and devices. It differs from other fields of medicine in the array of disciplines it brings together and in its ability to create or harness the body’s innate healing capacity.
 
We continue to educate the regenerative medicine market about the impact of effective biopreservation on the ability to create commercially viable manufactured products with participation in scientific conferences and industry trade events by exhibiting, presenting scientific and business lectures, and sponsoring industry association events. We are a corporate or affiliate member of the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, the BEST Collaborative, and the International Society for Cellular Therapy.

We have secured a valuable position as a supplier of critical reagents to hundreds of cell and gene therapy companies, including two companies with FDA approved commercial products. We estimate that our biopreservation media products are incorporated in over 300 applications for new cell and tissue-based regenerative medicine products and therapies. A significant number of applications involve CAR-T cell and other types of T cells, mesenchymal stem cells targeting blood cancers, solid tumors and other leading causes of death and disability. We estimate that annual revenue from each application in which our products are used could range from $0.5 million to $2.0 million, if such application is approved and our customer commences large scale commercial manufacturing of the biologic based therapy.
