Item 1.        Business
Overview
We are a leading global vacation company that offers vacation ownership, exchange, rental and resort and property management, along with related businesses, products and services. Our business operates in two reportable segments: Vacation Ownership and Exchange & Third-Party Management.
As of December 31, 2018, our Vacation Ownership segment had more than 100 resorts and over 660,000 owners and members of a diverse portfolio that includes seven vacation ownership brands licensed under exclusive, long-term relationships with Marriott International and Hyatt. We are the exclusive worldwide developer, marketer, seller and manager of vacation ownership and related products under the Marriott Vacation Club, Grand Residences by Marriott, Sheraton, Westin, and Hyatt Residence Club brands, as well as under Marriott Vacation Club Pulse, an extension to the Marriott Vacation Club brand. We are also the exclusive worldwide developer, marketer and seller of vacation ownership and related products under The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club brand, we have the non-exclusive right to develop, market and sell whole ownership residential products under The Ritz-Carlton Residences brand, and we have a license to use the St. Regis brand for specified fractional ownership resorts.
Our Vacation Ownership segment generates most of its revenues from four primary sources: selling vacation ownership products; managing vacation ownership resorts, clubs and owners’ associations; financing consumer purchases of vacation ownership products; and renting vacation ownership inventory.
As of December 31, 2018, our Exchange & Third-Party Management segment includes exchange networks and membership programs comprised of more than 3,200 resorts in over 80 nations and nearly two million members, as well as management of more than 180 other resorts and lodging properties. We provide these services through a variety of brands including Interval International, Trading Places International, Vacation Resorts International, and Aqua-Aston. Exchange & Third-Party Management segment revenue generally is fee-based and derived from membership, exchange and rental transactions, property and owners’ association management, and other related products and services.
Our strategic goal is to further strengthen our leadership position in the vacation ownership industry through initiatives to drive profitable revenue growth, maximize cash flow and optimize our capital structure, including by selectively pursuing capital efficient vacation ownership deal structures, focus on the satisfaction of our owners and guests and the engagement of our associates, transform our business while integrating the recent acquisition of ILG, and selectively pursue compelling new business opportunities. We believe that we have significant competitive advantages, including our scale and global reach, the quality and strength of our brands, our system of high-quality resorts, our loyal and highly satisfied customer base, our capital efficient business model, our long-standing track record and our experienced management team and engaged associates.
The Vacation Ownership Industry
The vacation ownership industry (also known as the timeshare industry) enables customers to share ownership and use of fully-furnished vacation accommodations. Typically, a purchaser acquires an interest (known as a “vacation ownership interest” or a “VOI”) that is either a real estate ownership interest (known as a “timeshare estate”) or a contractual right-to-use interest (known as a “timeshare license”) in a single resort or a collection of resort properties. In the United States, most vacation ownership products are sold as timeshare estates, which can be structured in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, a deeded real estate interest in a specified accommodation unit, an undivided interest in a building or an entire resort, or a beneficial interest in a trust that owns one or more resort properties. By purchasing a vacation ownership interest, owners make a commitment to vacation. For many purchasers, vacation ownership provides an attractive alternative to traditional lodging accommodations (such as hotels, resorts and condominium rentals). In addition to avoiding the volatility in room rates to which traditional lodging customers are subject, vacation ownership purchasers also enjoy accommodations that are, on average, more than twice the size of traditional hotel rooms and typically have more features, such as kitchens and separate living areas. Purchasers who might otherwise buy a second home find vacation ownership a preferable alternative because it is more affordable and reduces maintenance and upkeep concerns.
Typically, developers sell vacation ownership interests for a fixed purchase price that is paid in full at closing or financed with a loan. Many vacation ownership companies provide financing or facilitate access to third-party bank financing for customers. Vacation ownership resorts are often operated by a nonprofit property owners’ association of which owners of vacation ownership interests are members. Most property owners’ associations are governed by a board of directors that includes owners and which may include representatives of the developer. Some vacation ownership resorts are held through a trust structure in which a trustee holds title and manages the property. The board of the property owners’ association, or trustee, as applicable, typically delegates much of the responsibility for managing the resort to a management company, which is often affiliated with the developer.
After the initial purchase, most vacation ownership programs require the owner of the vacation ownership interest to pay an annual maintenance fee. This fee represents the owner’s allocable share of the costs and expenses of operating and maintaining the vacation ownership property and providing program services. This fee typically covers expenses such as housekeeping, landscaping, taxes, insurance and resort labor, a property management fee payable to the management company for providing management services, and an assessment to fund a capital asset reserve account used to renovate, refurbish and replace furnishings, common areas and other assets (such as parking lots or roofs) as needed over time. Owners typically reserve their usage of vacation accommodations in advance through a reservation system (often provided by the management company or an affiliated entity), unless a vacation ownership interest specifies fixed usage dates and a particular unit every year.
The vacation ownership industry has grown through expansion of established vacation ownership developers as well as entrance into the market of well-known lodging and entertainment brands, including Marriott, Sheraton, Hilton, Hyatt, Westin and Disney. The industry’s growth can also be attributed to increased market acceptance of vacation ownership products, stronger consumer protection laws and the evolution of vacation ownership interests from a fixed- or floating-week product, which provides the right to use the same property every year, to membership in multi-resort vacation networks, which offer a more flexible vacation experience. These vacation networks often issue their members an annual allotment of points that can be redeemed for stays at affiliated vacation ownership resorts or for alternative vacation experiences available through the program.
To enhance the flexibility and appeal of their products, many vacation ownership developers affiliate their projects with vacation ownership exchange service providers so that owners may exchange their rights to use the developer’s resorts in which they have purchased an interest for accommodation at other resorts in the exchange service provider’s broader network of properties. The two leading exchange service providers are Interval International, our subsidiary, and RCI, LLC, a subsidiary of Wyndham Destinations, Inc. (“RCI”). Interval International’s network includes more than 3,200 resorts, and RCI’s network includes over 4,300 affiliated resorts, as identified on RCI’s website.
According to the American Resort Development Association (“ARDA”), a trade association representing the vacation ownership and resort development industries, as of December 31, 2017, the U.S. vacation ownership community was comprised of over 1,500 resorts, representing more than 200,000 units and an estimated 9.5 million vacation ownership week equivalents. According to ARDA, sales in the U.S. market were approximately $9.6 billion in 2017. We believe there is considerable potential for further growth in the industry both in the U.S. and globally.
History
For more than 30 years, we have been providing memorable vacation experiences to millions of families. Prior to the incorporation of Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation in Delaware in June 2011, our operations were the vacation ownership division of Marriott International. Since our November 2011 spin-off from Marriott International (the “Marriott Spin-Off”), we have been an independent public company, with our common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “VAC” and our corporate headquarters located in Orlando, Florida.
Since 1984, when Marriott International became the first major lodging company to enter the vacation ownership industry with its acquisition of American Resorts, a small vacation ownership company, we have been recognized as a leader and innovator in the vacation ownership industry. Marriott International leveraged its well-known “Marriott” brand to sell vacation ownership intervals, which were frequently located at resorts developed adjacent to Marriott International hotels. Over time, the company differentiated its offerings through its high-quality resorts that were purpose-built for vacation ownership, exchange opportunities available under its customer loyalty program, Marriott Bonvoy, that increased the flexibility of use of ownership, its dedication to excellent customer service and its commitment to ethical business practices. These qualities encouraged repeat business and word-of-mouth customer referrals.
In connection with the Marriott Spin-Off, we entered into a License, Services, and Development Agreement (the “Marriott License Agreement”) with Marriott International and a License, Services, and Development Agreement (the “Ritz-Carlton License Agreement”) with The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, L.L.C. (“The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company”), a subsidiary of Marriott International. Under these license agreements, we are granted the exclusive right, for the terms of the license agreements, to use certain Marriott and Ritz-Carlton marks and intellectual property in our vacation ownership business, the exclusive right to use the Grand Residences by Marriott marks and intellectual property in our residential real estate business and the non-exclusive right to use certain Ritz-Carlton marks and intellectual property in our residential real estate business. 
Under the Marriott Rewards Affiliation Agreement that we entered into with Marriott International (the “Marriott Rewards Agreement”), we participate in the customer loyalty program now known as Marriott Bonvoy; this participation includes the ability to purchase and use Marriott Bonvoy points in connection with our Marriott-branded vacation ownership business. The Marriott Rewards Agreement is coterminous with the Marriott License Agreement.
On September 1, 2018, we completed the previously announced acquisition of ILG, LLC (formerly known as ILG, Inc., “ILG”). ILG’s businesses included Aqua-Aston Hospitality, Hyatt Vacation Ownership (“HVO”), Interval International, Trading Places International, Vacation Resorts International, VRI Europe and Vistana Signature Experiences (“Vistana”), the exclusive licensee for the Sheraton and Westin brands in vacation ownership. Shareholders of ILG received 0.165 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and $14.75 in cash, without interest, for each share of ILG common stock, par value $0.01 per share, that they owned immediately before the transaction closed. We paid approximately $4.6 billion in aggregate consideration. 
ILG was incorporated in May 2008 in connection with the spin-off of IAC/InterActiveCorp, or IAC, into five separate publicly traded companies. The businesses operated by ILG’s subsidiaries have extensive operating histories. Our Interval International business was founded in 1976; the Aqua-Aston business traces its roots in lodging back 70 years; Trading Places International was founded in 1973 and Vacation Resorts International in 1981; the HVO business began in 1994 and Vistana was established in 1980.
Business Strategy
Our strategic goal is to further strengthen our leadership position in the vacation ownership industry. To achieve this goal, we are pursuing the following initiatives:
Drive profitable revenue growth
We intend to continue to generate growth in vacation ownership sales by leveraging our globally recognized brand names and targeting high-quality inventory that allows us to add desirable new destinations to our systems with new on-site sales locations. We expect to focus our efforts to generate growth through our integrated platform that provides exclusive access to the world-class loyalty programs of Marriott International and Hyatt. We will also continue to focus on our over 660,000 owners around the world. In 2018, approximately 65 percent of our vacation ownership contract sales were to our existing owners. We are concentrating on growing our tour flow cost effectively as we seek to grow first-time buyer tours through our strategy that emphasizes new sales locations and new marketing channels. As the vacation ownership business continues to grow sales and we add new resorts, our vacation ownership revenue streams from consumer financing, management fees, rentals and ancillary services are expected to grow. 
We also plan to grow our recurring revenues which tend to be less capital intensive than sales of vacation ownership. Our recurring revenues include management of resorts and owners’ associations as well as membership, club and other revenues in both our Vacation Ownership and Exchange & Third-Party Management segments. These revenues generally are more predictable due to the relatively fixed nature of resort operating expenses and, in the case of management and exchange revenues, contractual agreements that typically span many years and are often automatically renewable.
Maximize cash flow and optimize our capital structure, including by selectively pursuing capital efficient vacation ownership deal structures
Through the use of our points-based products, we are able to more closely match inventory investment with sales pace and reduce inventory levels, thereby generating strong cash flows over time. Limiting the amount of completed inventory on hand and pursuing capital efficient vacation ownership inventory arrangements enable us to reduce the maintenance fees that we pay on unsold inventory. In addition, we proactively buy back previously sold vacation ownership interests at lower costs than would be required to develop new inventory.
We expect to maintain an attractive leverage profile. We intend to meet our ongoing liquidity needs through cash on hand, operating cash flow, our $600 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Corporate Credit Facility”), our $250 million non-recourse warehouse credit facility (the “Warehouse Credit Facility”), and continued access to the asset-backed securities (“ABS”) term financing market. We believe this will enable us to maintain a level of liquidity that ensures financial flexibility, giving us the ability to pursue strategic growth opportunities, withstand potential future economic downturns, optimize our cost of capital, and pursue strategies for returning excess capital to shareholders. 
Focus on the satisfaction of our owners and guests as well as the engagement of our associates
We are in the business of providing high-quality vacation experiences to our owners and guests around the world and we believe that maintaining a high level of engagement across all of our customer groups is key to our success. We intend to maintain and improve their satisfaction with our products and services, which drives incremental sales as customers choose to spend more time at our resorts. Because our owners and guests are our most cost-effective vacation ownership sales channels, we intend to continue to leverage our strong customer satisfaction to drive higher margin sales volumes. We intend to provide innovative offerings in new destinations to meet the needs of current and future customers and intend to develop new offerings to attract the next generation of travelers looking for a greater variety of experiences with the high quality standards expected from brands they trust.
Engaging our associates in the success of our business continues to be one of our long-term core strategies. We understand the connection between the engagement of our associates and the satisfaction and engagement of our owners and guests. At the heart of our culture is the belief that if we take care of our associates, they will take care of our owners and guests and the owners and guests will return again and again.
Transform our business in connection with the integration of the ILG Acquisition
As we continue to integrate the businesses acquired in September 2018, we are simultaneously working to drive digitally-oriented solutions, develop new growth channels and streamline our business processes through technology. We are focused on integrating functions, leveraging strengths across our businesses, and pursuing transformational opportunities that can further differentiate us from our competitors. We intend to advance our company analytics to encourage greater points utilization, provide enhanced resort experiences, and create more relevant and high value targeted leads for tour offers and vacation options. This is a multi-year process that is designed to achieve cost savings synergies and increase revenue opportunities.
Selectively pursue compelling new business opportunities
We are positioned to explore new business opportunities, such as the continued enhancement of our exchange programs, new management affiliations and acquisitions of existing vacation ownership and related businesses. We intend to selectively pursue these types of opportunities, focusing on opportunities that drive recurring revenue and profit streams. Prior to entering into any new business opportunity, we will evaluate its strategic fit and assess whether it is complementary to our current business, has strong expected financial returns and complements our existing competencies.
Competitive Strengths
A leading global vacation ownership company
We are one of the world’s largest vacation ownership companies, based on number of owners, members, number of resorts and revenues. We believe our scale and global reach, coupled with our renowned brands and development, marketing, sales, exchange and management expertise, help us achieve operational efficiencies and support future growth opportunities. Our size allows us to provide owners with the flexibility of a wide variety of experiences within our high-quality resort portfolio, coupled with the ease and certainty of working with a single trusted provider. We also believe our size helps us obtain better financing terms from lenders, achieve operational cost savings from our increased scale, and attract talented management and associates. Our Interval International network includes members and resorts from our Marriott, Westin, Sheraton and Hyatt clubs which can attract developers and homeowners associations to affiliate with the network and provide an opportunity for their owners to exchange into our branded resorts.
The breadth and depth of our operations enables us to offer a variety of products and to continue to adapt those products to the ever changing needs and preferences of our existing and future customers. For example, in addition to traditional resort experiences, our Marriott Vacation Club Pulse brand extension features unique properties that embrace the spirit and culture of their urban locations, creating an authentic sense of place while delivering easy access to local interests, attractions and transportation. 
Premier global brands with access to expansive customer bases
We believe that our exclusive licenses with Marriott International and Hyatt for premier global brands in the vacation ownership business provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage. Marriott International is a leading lodging company with more than 6,900 hotels in 130 countries and territories as of December 31, 2018. In addition, Hyatt has over 800 affiliated hotels globally as of December 31, 2018. Through seven brands that we license from Marriott International for use in vacation ownership, we benefit from exclusive long-term access to the 120 million members in the Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program. We believe this exclusive access to guests with an affinity for our brands aids our marketing efforts and significantly enhances our ability to drive future sales, as we predominantly generate vacation ownership interest sales through brand loyalty-affiliated sales channels. We expect to leverage our exclusive call transfer arrangements, on-site marketing at Marriott branded hotels, and use of certain exclusive marketing rights to increase sales across all of our Marriott-affiliated vacation ownership properties. 
Through our relationship with Hyatt, we also have the exclusive rights to develop, market and sell vacation ownership interests through the Hyatt Vacation Ownership programs, which provide access to members of the World of Hyatt loyalty program, which includes over 16 million members as of December 31, 2018.
Loyal, highly satisfied customers
We have a large, highly satisfied customer base. Owner satisfaction is evidenced both by positive survey responses and by the fact that our average resort occupancy for our Vacation Ownership segment was nearly 89 percent in 2018, significantly higher than the overall vacation ownership industry average of 81 percent in 2017, the most recent year for which average resort occupancy data was reported by ARDA. We believe that strong customer satisfaction and brand loyalty result in more frequent use of our products and encourage owners to purchase additional products and to recommend our products to friends and family, which in turn generates higher revenues.
Capital efficient business model providing strong free cash flow and financial flexibility. 
We believe that our scale, recurring revenue fee streams and enhanced margin profile will enable us to maintain flexibility for continued organic growth, strategic acquisitions and debt repayment. Following the ILG Acquisition, a higher proportion of our total revenue excluding cost reimbursements derives from sources other than the sale of vacation ownership interests. The addition of our Exchange & Third-Party Management businesses creates ample opportunities to realize recurring higher-margin, fee-based revenue streams with modest required capital expenditures, enhancing our margins and free cash flow generation over time.
In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had a finished vacation ownership inventory balance of $843 million. Our points-based vacation ownership products allow us to utilize capital efficient structures and maintain long-term sales locations without the need to construct additional units at each location. We are able to better manage our inventory needs, while achieving top line growth without a need to significantly increase inventory investments. Our disciplined inventory approach and use of capital efficient vacation ownership deal structures, including working with third parties that develop new inventory or convert previously built units that are sold to us close to when such inventory is needed to support sales, is expected to support strong free cash flow generation.

Long-standing track record, experienced management and engaged associates
We have been a pioneer in the vacation ownership industry since 1984, when Marriott International became the first company to introduce a lodging-branded vacation ownership product. Our seasoned management team is led by Stephen P. Weisz, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Weisz has served as President of our company since 1996 and has over 45 years of combined experience at Marriott International and Marriott Vacations Worldwide. William J. Shaw, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, is the former Vice Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer of Marriott International and spent nearly 37 years with Marriott International. Our eleven executive officers have an average of 28 years of total combined experience at Marriott Vacations Worldwide, our subsidiary companies and Marriott International. We believe our management team’s extensive public company and vacation ownership industry experience has enabled us to achieve solid operating results and will enable us to continue to respond quickly and effectively to changing market conditions and consumer trends. Our management’s experience in the highly regulated vacation ownership industry also provides us with a competitive advantage in expanding existing product forms and developing new ones.
Engaged associates delivering high levels of customer service driving repeat customers
We believe that our associates provide superior customer service and this dedication to serving the customer enhances our competitive position. Approximately 65 percent of our vacation ownership contract sales in 2018 were to existing owners, which enabled them to enjoy longer stays and have greater flexibility in their vacation choices. Sales to existing owners typically have significantly lower sales and marketing costs than sales to new owners. We leverage outstanding associate engagement and strong corporate culture to deliver positive customer experiences in sales, marketing, exchange, management and resort operations. 
We survey our associates regularly through an external survey provider to understand their satisfaction and engagement, defined as how passionate employees are about the company’s mission and their willingness to “go the extra mile” to see it succeed. We have historically ranked highly compared to other companies participating in such surveys. 
VACATION OWNERSHIP SEGMENT
Our Vacation Ownership segment develops, markets, sells, rents and manages vacation ownership and related products under our licensed brands. The segment generates most of its revenues from four primary sources: selling vacation ownership products; managing vacation ownership resorts, clubs and owners’ associations; financing consumer purchases of vacation ownership products; and renting vacation ownership inventory. The Vacation Ownership segment represented approximately 94 percent of our consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting the September 2018 acquisition of ILG.

Products
Points-Based Vacation Ownership Products
We sell the majority of our products through points-based ownership programs, including Marriott Vacation Club, Sheraton Flex, Westin Flex, Westin Aventuras, and the Hyatt Residence Club Portfolio Program. While the structural characteristics of each of our points-based programs differ, in each program, owners receive an annual allotment of points representing owners’ usage rights, and owners can use these points to access vacation ownership units across multiple destinations within their program’s portfolio of resort locations. Each program permits shorter or longer stays than a traditional weeks-based vacation ownership product and provides for flexibility with respect to check-in days and size of accommodations. In addition to traditional resort stays, the programs enable our owners to exchange their points for a wide variety of innovative vacation experiences, which may include cruises, airline travel, guided tours, safaris and other unique vacation alternatives. Members of our points-based programs typically pay annual fees in exchange for the ability to participate in the program. In 
addition to points-based ownership programs which allow owners to access multiple destinations within a single program, we offer points programs at certain resorts in St. John and Hawaii which allow owners to access that particular single site using points in a similar use fashion to the other points based products.
Our points programs allow owners to bank and borrow their annual point allotments, access other locations through the applicable internal exchange programs that we operate, and access Interval International’s network of more than 3,200 affiliated resorts. Owners can also trade their vacation ownership usage rights for Marriott Bonvoy points or World of Hyatt points, as applicable, which can be used to access participating hotels or redeemed for airline miles or other merchandise offered through such customer loyalty program. Our points-based products offer usage in perpetuity or for a term of years, and may consist of real estate interests or a contractual right-to-use. 
Weeks-Based Vacation Ownership Products
We continue to sell Marriott Vacation Club, Westin, Sheraton and Hyatt branded weeks-based vacation ownership products in select markets, including in countries where legal and tax constraints currently limit our ability to include those locations in one of our existing points-based programs. Our products include multi-week vacation ownership interests in specific Grand Residences by Marriott, St. Regis Residence Club, The Luxury Collection Residence Club, and The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club resorts. Our weeks-based vacation ownership products in the United States and select Caribbean locations are typically sold as fee simple deeded real estate interests at a specific resort representing an ownership interest in perpetuity, except where restricted by leasehold or other structural limitations. We sell vacation ownership interests as a right-to-use product subject to a finite term in Asia Pacific and Europe.
Global Exchange Opportunities
We offer our existing Marriott Vacation Club owners who hold weeks-based products the opportunity to participate, on a voluntary basis, in Marriott Vacation Club Destinations (“MVCD”), an exchange program through which many of MVCD’s vacation experiences are offered. All existing owners, whether or not they elect to participate in the MVCD exchange program, retain their existing rights and privileges of vacation ownership. Owners who elect to participate in the exchange program receive the ability to trade their weeks-based interval usage for vacation club points usage each year, typically subject to payment of an initial enrollment fee and annual club dues. As of the end of 2018, approximately 182,000 weeks-based owners have enrolled nearly 290,000 weeks in MVCD’s exchange program since its launch in 2010, with more than 222,000 total owners able to use points.
The Vistana Signature Network (“VSN”) provides Westin Vacation Club and Sheraton Vacation Club owners access to its affiliated resorts as well as the opportunity to exchange through the new Marriott Bonvoy program (previously the Starwood Preferred Guest or SPG program) to Marriott resorts, through the Interval International network or for a cruise. Based on the point value of the home resort interest owned, customers can choose other VSN affiliated resorts, the type of villa, the date of travel and the length of stay. VSN members have a four-month period in which they have exclusive rights to occupancy at the related resort or points program without competition from other network members. During this home resort period, they can reserve occupancy based on the season and unit type purchased. As of December 31, 2018, VSN included more than 182,000 members. 
Hyatt Residence Club provides its owners internal exchange among Hyatt Residence Club resorts as well as the opportunity to trade their club points for World of Hyatt points which may be redeemed at participating Hyatt branded properties and exchanged through the Interval International network. Owners will receive Hyatt Residence Club points if they have not reserved at their home resort or points program during their allotted preference period or if they elect to convert to points earlier. As of December 31, 2018, this points-based membership exchange system served more than 33,000 owners.
Sources of Revenue
We generate most of our revenues from four primary sources: selling vacation ownership products; managing vacation ownership resorts, clubs and owners’ associations; financing consumer purchases of vacation ownership products; and renting vacation ownership inventory.
Sale of Vacation Ownership Products
Our principal source of revenue is the sale of vacation ownership interests. See “—Marketing and Sales Activities” below for information regarding our marketing and sales activities.
Resort Management and Other Services
We generate revenue from fees we earn for managing each of our resorts. See “—Management Activities” below for additional information on the terms of our management agreements. In addition, we earn revenue for providing ancillary offerings, including food and beverage, retail, and golf and spa offerings at our resorts. We also receive annual fees, club dues, settlement fees from the sale of vacation ownership products, and certain transaction-based fees from owners and other third parties, including external exchange service providers with which we are associated.
Financing
We earn interest income on loans that we provide to purchasers of our vacation ownership interests, as well as loan servicing and other fees. See “—Consumer Financing” below for further information regarding our consumer financing activities.
Rental
We generate revenue from rentals of inventory that we hold for sale as interests in our vacation ownership programs or as residences, or inventory that we control because our owners have elected alternative usage options permitted under our vacation ownership programs.
Marketing and Sales Activities
We sell our upper upscale tier vacation ownership products under our brands primarily through our worldwide network of resort-based sales centers and certain off-site sales locations. Our vacation ownership interests are currently marketed for sale throughout the United States and in over 25 countries around the world, targeting customers who vacation regularly with a focus on family, relaxation and recreational activities. In 2018, approximately 90 percent of our vacation ownership contract sales originated at sales centers that are co-located with one of our resorts. We maintain a range of different off-site sales centers, including our central telesales organization based in Orlando and our network of third-party brokers in Latin America and Europe. We have more than 80 global sales locations focused on the sale of vacation ownership interests. We utilize a number of marketing channels to attract qualified customers to our sales locations.
We solicit our owners primarily while they are staying in our resorts, but also offer our owners the opportunity to make additional purchases through direct phone sales, owner events and inquiries from our central customer service centers located in Salt Lake City, Utah, Orlando, Florida, and Palm Springs, California. In 2018, approximately 65 percent of our vacation ownership contract sales were to our existing owners. In addition, we are concentrating on growing our tour flow cost effectively as we seek to generate more first-time buyer tours through our strategy that emphasizes adding new sales locations and new marketing channels.
We also market to existing Marriott and Hyatt customer loyalty program members and travelers who are staying in locations where we have like-branded resorts. We market extensively to guests in Marriott International or Hyatt hotels that are located near one of our sales locations and have call transfer arrangements with Marriott International pursuant to which callers to certain of its reservation centers are asked if they would like to be transferred to one of our representatives that can tell them about our products. In addition, we operate other local marketing venues in various high-traffic areas. A significant part of our direct marketing activities are focused on prospects in the Marriott and Hyatt customer loyalty program databases and our in-house databases of qualified prospects. We offer guests who do not buy a vacation ownership interest during their initial tour the opportunity to purchase a return package for a future stay at our resorts. These return guests are nearly twice as likely to purchase as a first-time visitor. 
We are also focused on expanding our use of social media and digital marketing channels through our brand and social optimization business unit. This team will focus on building stronger brand reputation associations within the vacation community via social channel audience growth, personalized community engagement, and data driven content marketing. 
Our sales tours are designed to provide our guests with an overview of our company and our products, as well as a customized presentation to explain how our products and services can meet their vacationing needs. Our sales force is highly trained in a consultative sales approach designed to ensure that we meet customers’ needs on an individual basis. We hire our sales executives based on stringent selection criteria. After they are hired, they spend a minimum of four weeks in product and sales training before interacting with any customers. We manage our sales executives’ consistency of presentation and professionalism using a variety of sales tools and technology and through a post-presentation survey of our guests that measures many aspects of each guest’s interaction with us.
We believe consumers place a great deal of trust in the Marriott, Westin, Sheraton, Hyatt and Ritz-Carlton brands and the strength of these brands is important to our ability to attract qualified prospects in the marketplace. We maintain a prominent presence on the www.marriott.com, www.ritzcarlton.com and www.hyatt.com websites. Our proprietary sites include www.marriottvacationsworldwide.com, www.marriottvacationclub.com, www.ritzcarltonclub.com, www.vistana.com, www.hyattresidenceclub.com, and www.theresidenceclub.com.
Inventory and Development Activities
We secure inventory by building additional phases at our existing resorts, repurchasing previously sold inventory in the secondary market, repurchasing inventory as a result of owner loan or maintenance fee defaults, or developing or acquiring inventory at resorts in strategic markets. We proactively buy back previously sold vacation ownership interests under our repurchase programs at lower costs than would be required to develop new inventory. Efficient use of our capital is achieved through our points-based business model, which allows us to supply many sales locations with new inventory sourced from a small number of resort locations. 
We intend to continue to selectively pursue growth opportunities primarily in North America and Asia Pacific by targeting high-quality inventory that allows us to add desirable new destinations to our system with new on-site sales locations in ways that optimize the timing of our capital investments. These capital efficient vacation ownership deal structures may include working with third parties to develop new inventory or to convert previously built units to be sold to us close to when we need such inventory.
Over a quarter of our vacation ownership resorts are co-located with same-branded hotel properties. Co-location of our resorts with same-branded hotels can provide several advantages from development, operations, customer experience and marketing perspectives, including sharing amenities, infrastructure and staff, integration of services, and other cost efficiencies. The larger campus of an integrated vacation ownership and hotel resort often can afford our owners more varied and elaborate amenities than those that would generally be available at a stand-alone resort. Shared infrastructure can also reduce our overall development costs for our resorts on a per unit basis. Integration of services and sharing staff and other expenses can lower overhead and operating costs for our resorts. Our on-site access to hotel customers, including customer loyalty program members, who are visiting co-located hotels also provides us with a cost-effective marketing channel for our vacation ownership products.
Co-located resorts require cooperation and coordination among all parties and are subject to cost sharing and integration agreements among us, the applicable property owners’ association and managers and owners of the co-located hotel. Our license agreements with Marriott International, Hyatt and Ritz-Carlton allow for the development of co-located properties in the future, and we intend to opportunistically pursue co-located projects with them.
Owners generally can offer their vacation ownership interests for resale on the secondary market, which can create pricing pressure on the sale of developer inventory. However, owners who purchase vacation ownership interests on the secondary market typically do not receive all of the benefits that owners who purchase products directly from us receive. When an owner purchases a vacation ownership interest directly from us or a resale on the secondary market, the owner receives certain entitlements that are tied to the underlying vacation ownership interest, such as the right to reserve a resort unit that underlies their vacation ownership interest in order to occupy that unit or exchange its use for use of a unit at another resort through an external exchange service provider, as well as benefits that are incidental to the purchase of the vacation ownership interest. However the purchaser on the secondary market may not be entitled to receive certain incidental benefits. For example, owners who purchase our products on the secondary market may have restricted access to our internal exchange programs and may not be entitled to trade their usage rights for Marriott Bonvoy points. Therefore, those owners may only be entitled to use the inventory that underlies the vacation ownership interests they purchased. Additionally, many of our vacation ownership interests provide us with a right of first refusal on secondary market sales. We monitor sales that occur in the secondary market and exercise our right of first refusal when it is advantageous for us to do so, whether due to pricing, desire for the particular inventory, or other factors. All owners, whether they purchase directly from us or on the secondary market, are responsible for the annual maintenance fees, property taxes and any assessments that are levied by the relevant property owners’ association, as well as any exchange service membership dues or service fees.
Management Activities
We enter into a management agreement with the property owners’ association or other governing body at our resorts and, when a trust holds interests in resorts, with the trust’s governing body. In exchange for a management fee, we typically provide owner account management (reservations and usage selection), housekeeping, check-in, maintenance and billing and collections services. The management fee is typically based on either a percentage of the budgeted costs to operate such resorts or a fixed fee arrangement. We earn these fees regardless of usage or occupancy. We also receive revenues that represent reimbursement for certain costs we incur under our management agreements, principally payroll-related costs at the locations where we employ the associates providing on-site services.
The terms of our management agreements generally range from three to ten years and are generally subject to periodic renewal for one to five year terms. Many of these agreements renew automatically unless either party provides advance notice of termination before the expiration of the term. When our management agreement for a branded resort is not renewed or is terminated, the resort loses the ability to use the brand and trademarks. The owners at such resorts also lose their ability to trade their vacation ownership usage rights for customer loyalty points and to access other resorts through one of our internal exchange systems.
The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company manages the on-site operations for The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club and The Ritz-Carlton Residences properties in our portfolio under separate management agreements with us. We provide property owners’ association governance and vacation ownership program management services for The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club and co-located The Ritz-Carlton Residences properties, including preparing association budgets, facilitating association meetings, billing and collecting maintenance fees, and supporting reservations, vacation experience planning and other off-site member services. We and The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company typically split the management fees equally for these resorts. If a management agreement for a resort expires or is terminated, the resort loses the ability to use the Ritz-Carlton name and trademarks. The owners at such resorts also lose their ability to access other usage benefits, such as access to accommodations at other The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club resorts, preferential access to Ritz-Carlton hotels worldwide and access to our internal exchange and vacation travel options.
Each management agreement requires the property owners’ association, trust association or other governing body to provide sufficient funds to pay for the vacation ownership program and operating costs. To satisfy this requirement, owners of vacation ownership interests pay an annual maintenance fee. This fee represents the owner’s allocable share of the costs of operating and maintaining the resorts or interests in the timeshare plan in which they hold a vacation ownership interest, including management fees and expenses, taxes (in some locations), insurance, and other related costs, and the costs of providing program services (such as reservation services). This fee includes a management fee payable to us for providing management services as well as an assessment for funds to be deposited into a capital asset reserve fund and used to renovate, refurbish and replace furnishings, common areas and other resort assets (such as parking lots or roofs) as needed over time. As the owner of completed but unsold vacation ownership inventory, we also pay maintenance fees in accordance with the legal requirements of the jurisdictions applicable to such resorts and programs. In addition, in early phases of development at a resort, we sometimes enter into subsidy agreements with the property owners’ associations under which we agree to pay costs that otherwise would be covered by annual maintenance fees associated with vacation ownership interests or units that have not yet been built. These subsidy arrangements help keep maintenance fees at a reasonable level for owners who purchase in the early stages of development.
In the event of a default by an owner in payment of maintenance fees or other assessments, the property owners’ association typically has the right to foreclose on or revoke the defaulting owner’s vacation ownership interest. We have entered into arrangements with several property owners’ associations to assist in reselling foreclosed or revoked vacation ownership interests in exchange for a fee, or to reacquire such foreclosed or revoked vacation ownership interests from the property owners’ associations.
Consumer Financing
We offer purchase money financing for purchasers of our vacation ownership products who meet our underwriting guidelines. By offering or eliminating financing incentives and modifying underwriting standards, we have been able to increase or decrease the volume of our financing activities depending on market conditions. We are not providing financing to buyers of our residential products.
In 2018, approximately 62 percent of our North America customers financed their vacation ownership purchase with us. The average loan for these vacation ownership products totaled approximately $26,600, which represented 82 percent of the average purchase price. Our policy is to require a minimum down payment of 10 percent of the purchase price, although down payments and interest rates are typically higher for applicants with credit scores below certain levels and for purchasers who do not have credit scores, such as non-U.S. purchasers. The average interest rate for these originated loans in 2018 was 12.74 percent and the average term was 10.5 years. Interest rates are fixed and a loan fully amortizes over the life of the loan. The average monthly mortgage payment for an owner who received a loan in 2018 was $405. We do not impose any prepayment penalties.
In 2018, approximately 93 percent of our loans were used to finance U.S.-based products. In our North America business, we perform a credit investigation or other review or inquiry to determine the purchaser’s credit history before originating a loan. The interest rates on the loans we provide are based primarily upon the purchaser’s credit score, the size of the purchase, and the term of the loan. We base our financing terms largely on a purchaser’s FICO score, which is a branded version of a consumer credit score widely used in the United States by banks and lending institutions. FICO scores range from 300 to 850 and are calculated based on information obtained from one or more of the three major U.S. credit reporting agencies that compile and report on a consumer’s credit history. In 2018, the average FICO score of our customers who were U.S. citizens or residents who financed a vacation ownership purchase was 738; 74 percent had a credit score of over 700, 90 percent had a credit score of over 650 and 98 percent had a credit score of over 600.
We use other information to determine minimum down payments and interest rates applicable to loans made to purchasers who do not have a credit score or who do not reside within the United States, such as regional historical default rates and currency fluctuation risk.
In the event of a default, we generally have the right to foreclose on or revoke the defaulting owner’s vacation ownership interest. We typically resell interests that we reacquire through foreclosure or revocation or place such interests into one of our points-based programs.
We securitize the majority of the consumer loans we originate in support of our vacation ownership business. Historically, we have sold these loans to institutional investors in the ABS market on a non-recourse basis, completing securitization transactions once or twice each year. These vacation ownership notes receivable securitizations provide funding for us at interest rates similar to those available to companies with investment grade credit ratings, and transfer the economic risks and substantially all the benefits of the consumer loans we originate to third parties. In a vacation ownership notes receivable securitization, various classes of debt securities issued by a special purpose entity are generally collateralized by a single tranche of transferred assets, which consist of vacation ownership notes receivable. During 2018, we completed one securitization transaction, which is discussed in detail in Footnote 13 “Securitized Debt” to our Financial Statements. On an ongoing basis, we have the ability to use our Warehouse Credit Facility to securitize eligible consumer loans derived from certain branded vacation ownership sales. Those loans may later be transferred to term securitization transactions in the ABS market, which we intend to continue to complete at least once per year. Since 2000, we have issued over $5.5 billion of debt securities in securitization transactions in the ABS market, excluding amounts securitized through warehouse credit facilities or private bank transactions. We retain the servicing and collection responsibilities for the loans we securitize, for which we receive a servicing fee.

EXCHANGE & THIRD-PARTY MANAGEMENT SEGMENT
Our Exchange & Third-Party Management segment includes exchange networks and membership programs comprised of more than 3,200 resorts in over 80 nations and nearly two million members, as well as management of over 180 other resorts and lodging properties. We provide these services through a variety of brands including Interval International, Trading Places International, Vacation Resorts International, Aqua-Aston and Great Destinations. The segment revenue generally is fee-based and derived from membership, exchange and rental transactions, property and owners’ association management, and other related products and services. The Exchange & Third-Party Management segment represented approximately 5 percent of our consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting the September 2018 acquisition of ILG.

Exchange Networks and Membership Programs
Interval International
Our primary exchange offering is Interval International’s network, a membership-based exchange program which also provides a comprehensive package of value-added products and services to members and developers. As of December 31, 2018, the Interval International network consisted of more than 3,200 resorts in over 80 nations and approximately 1.8 million members. Generally, individuals are enrolled by resort developers in connection with their purchase of vacation ownership interests from such resort developers, with initial membership fees being paid on behalf of members by the resort developers. Members may also enroll directly, for instance, when they purchase a vacation ownership interest through resale or owners’ association affiliation at a resort that participates in the Interval International network. Interval International has established multi-year relationships with resort developers, including leading independent developers and our branded vacation ownership programs, under exclusive affiliation agreements, which typically provide for continued resort participation following the agreement’s term. 
After their initial membership period, certain Interval International network members have the option of renewing their memberships for terms ranging from one to five years and paying their own membership fees directly to us. We sometimes refer to these as traditional members. Alternatively, some resort developers incorporate the Interval International network membership fee into certain annual fees they charge to owners of vacation ownership interests at their resorts or vacation ownership clubs, which results in these owners having their membership in the Interval International network and, where applicable, the Interval Gold or Interval Platinum program (as described below), automatically renewed through the period of their resort’s or club’s participation in the Interval International network. We sometimes refer to these as corporate members.
Interval International recognizes certain of its eligible Interval International network resorts as either a “Select Resort,” a “Select Boutique Resort,” a “Premier Resort,” a “Premier Boutique Resort,” an “Elite Resort” or an “Elite Boutique Resort” based upon the satisfaction of qualifying criteria, inspection, member feedback, and other resort-specific factors. Over 40 percent of Interval International network resorts were recognized as a Select, Select Boutique, Premier, Premier Boutique, Elite or Elite Boutique Resort as of December 31, 2018.
Products and Services
Exchange
Members are offered the ability to exchange usage rights in their vacation ownership interest for accommodations which are generally of comparable trading value to those relinquished, based on factors including location, quality, seasonality, unit attributes and time of relinquishment prior to occupancy.
Getaways
We also offer additional vacation rental opportunities to members of the Interval International network and certain other membership programs at attractive rates through Getaways. Getaways allow members to rent resort accommodations for a fee, plus applicable taxes. Resort accommodations available as Getaways consist of seasonal oversupply of vacation ownership accommodations within the applicable exchange network, as well as resort accommodations we source specifically for use in Getaways.
Interval Gold and Interval Platinum
Interval International network members also may take advantage of one of our two enhanced membership tiers, Interval Gold, or Interval Platinum, each of which provides value-added benefits and services for an additional fee. These benefits and services vary by country of residence, but generally consist of discounts on Getaways, a concierge service, a hotel discount program and Interval Options, a service that allows members to relinquish annual occupancy rights in their vacation ownership interests towards the purchase of various travel products, including hotel, cruise, golf and spa vacations. Members are enrolled in these programs either by resort developers in connection with the initial purchase of their vacation ownership interests or by upgrading their membership directly. As of December 31, 2018, more than 40 percent of Interval International network members participate in an upgraded membership tier.
Club Interval
This product gives owners of fixed or floating week vacation ownership interests the opportunity to use their resort week as points within the Interval International network. Club Interval members also receive all of the benefits of Interval Gold and can upgrade to Interval Platinum.
Sales and Marketing Support for Interval International network resorts
Resort developers promote membership in our exchange programs and related value-added services as an important benefit of owning a vacation ownership interest. We offer developers a selection of sales and marketing materials. These materials, many of which are available in multiple languages, include brochures, publications, sales-office displays, resort directories and Interval HD, an online video channel featuring resort and destination overviews. In addition, we offer programs, including our Leisure Time Passport program that resort developers use as a trial membership program for potential purchasers of vacation ownership interests.
Operational Support for Interval International network resorts
Interval International also makes available a comprehensive array of back-office servicing solutions to resort developers and resorts. For example, for an additional fee, we provide reservation services and billing and collection of maintenance fees and other amounts due to developers or owners’ associations. In addition, through consulting arrangements, we assist resort developers in the design of tailored vacation programs for owners of vacation ownership interests.
Trading Places International
Trading Places International provides exchange services to owners at certain of our managed timeshare properties as well as other direct-to-consumer exchanges that do not require a membership fee. For an annual fee, vacation owners may choose to join the upgraded Trading Places Prime program with additional benefits. Exchanges in these Trading Places programs are based on like value and upgrades are available upon payment of additional fees.
Revenue
Our exchange networks and membership programs revenue is fee-based and derived from membership, exchange and rental transactions, fees for ancillary products and services provided to members, and other products and services sold to developers.
Marketing 
Our exchange businesses maintain corporate and consumer marketing departments that are responsible for implementing marketing strategies. We also develop printed and digital materials to promote membership participation, exchange opportunities and other value-added services to existing members as well as for the Interval International business to secure new relationships with resort developers, owners’ associations and resorts to obtain and retain members.
Our consumer marketing efforts revolve around the deepening of new and existing customer relationships and increasing engagement and loyalty of members through a number of channels including direct mail, email, telemarketing, and online distribution as well as utilizing social media channels like Facebook and Instagram to inspire vacations, share stories and promote the vacation ownership lifestyle.
Interval International also markets products and services to resort developers and other parties in the vacation ownership industry through a series of business development initiatives. Our sales and services personnel proactively seek to establish strong relationships with developers and owners’ associations, providing input on consumer preferences and industry trends based upon years of experience. We believe that we have established a strong reputation within the vacation ownership industry as being highly responsive to the needs of resort developers, owners’ associations, management companies and owners of vacation ownership interests. In addition, we sponsor, participate in and attend numerous industry conferences around the world, to provide potential and existing industry participants opportunities to network and learn more about vacation ownership. 
Third-Party Management
We provide resort management services for vacation ownership resorts and other third-party vacation property owners through Vacation Resorts International, Trading Places International and Aqua-Aston. Our services may include day-to-day operations of the resorts, maintenance of the resorts, preparation of reports, budgets, owners’ association administration, risk management, quality assurance and employee training. As of December 31, 2018, we provided third-party management services to over 180 resorts.
Vacation Resorts International and Trading Places International provide management services to vacation ownership resorts pursuant to agreements with terms generally ranging from one to ten years many of which are automatically renewable. Generally, our management fees are paid by the owners’ association and funded from the annual maintenance fees paid by the individual owners to the association. These maintenance fees represent each owner’s allocable share of the costs of operating and maintaining the resorts, which generally includes personnel, property taxes, insurance, a capital asset reserve to fund refurbishment and other related costs. The management fees we earn are highly predictable due to the relatively fixed nature of resort operating expenses. We are reimbursed for the costs incurred to perform our services, principally related to personnel providing on-site services. We also offer vacation rental services to these owners’ associations. These rentals are made online directly to consumers through our websites, www.vriresorts.com, and www.tradingplaces.com, through third-party online travel agencies and through Interval International’s Getaways program.
Aqua-Aston provides management and rental services for condominium owners, hotel owners, and owners’ associations. The condominium rental properties are generally investment properties, and, to a lesser extent, second homes, owned by individuals who contract with Aqua‑Aston directly to manage, market and rent their properties, generally pursuant to short‑term agreements. We also offer such owners a comprehensive package of marketing, management and rental services designed to enhance rental income and profitability. Generally, owners’ association management services, including administrative, fiscal and quality assurance services, are provided pursuant to exclusive agreements with terms typically ranging from one to ten years or more, many of which are automatically renewable. Revenue is derived principally from fees for management of the hotel or condominium resort, and owners’ association as well as related rental services. Management fees consist of a base management fee and, in some instances for hotels or condominium resorts, an incentive management fee which is generally a percentage of operating profits or improvement in operating profits. Service fee revenue is based on the services provided to owners including reservations, sales and marketing, property accounting and information technology services either internally or through third-party providers.
Important to the success and continued growth of the Aqua-Aston business is our ability to source vacationers interested in booking vacation properties made available through our rental services. Our sales and marketing team in Honolulu, Hawaii, utilizes a variety of sales, marketing, revenue management and digital marketing initiatives to attract consumers and additional properties to Aqua‑Aston. The team in Hawaii utilizes many channels of distribution including traditional wholesale through tour operators and travel partners, online travel agencies and global distribution systems. In addition, Aqua‑Aston focuses on driving direct business through brand websites and our central reservations office. The sales team covers several market segments from corporate and government/military to travel agents and groups. We offer a variety of leisure accommodations to visitors from around the world through consumer websites such as, www.astonhotels.com, www.aquaresorts.com, www.aquahospitality.com, and www.mauicondo.com. 
CORPORATE AND OTHER
Corporate and Other consists of results not allocable to the Vacation Ownership or Exchange & Third-Party Management segments, including company-wide general and administrative costs, corporate interest expense, and consolidation of certain owners’ associations under the voting interest model, which are not included in operating segment resource allocation decision-making.
Intellectual Property
We manage properties and sell vacation ownership interests under the Marriott Vacation Club, Sheraton, Westin, Grand Residences by Marriott, The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club, The Ritz-Carlton Residences and Hyatt Residence Club brands under license agreements with Marriott International, Hyatt and The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company. Our Exchange & Third-Party Management segment includes the Interval International, Trading Place International, Vacation Resorts International and Aqua-Aston brands. We operate in a highly competitive industry and our brand names, trademarks, service marks, trade names and logos are very important to the marketing and sales of our products and services. We believe that our licensed brand names and other intellectual property have come to represent high standards of quality, caring, service and value to our customers and the traveling public. We register and protect our intellectual property where we deem appropriate and otherwise seek to protect against its unauthorized use.
Seasonality
Our revenue is influenced by the seasonal nature of travel. Within our Vacation Ownership segment, our sales and financing business experiences a modest impact from seasonality, with higher sales volumes during the traditional vacation periods. Our vacation ownership management businesses by and large do not experience significant seasonality, with the exception of our resort operations revenue, which tends to be higher in the first quarter.
Within our Exchange & Third-Party Management segment, we recognize exchange and Getaways revenue based on confirmation of the vacation; revenue is generally higher in the first quarter and lower in the fourth quarter. Remaining rental revenue is recognized based on occupancy. 
Competition
Competition in the vacation ownership industry is driven primarily by the quality, number and location of vacation ownership resorts, the quality and capability of the related property management program, trust in the brand, pricing of product offerings and the availability of program benefits, such as exchange programs and access to affiliated hotel networks. We believe that our focus on offering distinctive vacation experiences, combined with our financial strength, well-established and diverse market presence, strong brands, expertise and well-managed and maintained properties, will enable us to remain competitive. Vacation ownership is a vacation option that is positioned and sold as an attractive alternative to vacation rentals (such as hotels, resorts and condominium rentals) and second home ownership. The various segments within the vacation ownership industry can be differentiated by the quality level of the accommodations, range of services and ancillary offerings, and price. Our brands operate in the upper upscale and luxury tiers of the vacation ownership segment of the industry and the upper upscale and luxury tiers of the whole ownership segment (also referred to as the residential segment) of the industry.
Our competitors in the vacation ownership industry range from small vacation ownership companies to large branded hospitality companies that operate or license vacation ownership businesses. In North America, we typically compete with companies that sell upper upscale tier vacation ownership products under a lodging or entertainment brand umbrella, such as Hilton Grand Vacations Club, and Disney Vacation Club, as well as numerous regional vacation ownership operators. Our luxury vacation ownership products compete with vacation ownership products offered by Four Seasons, Exclusive Resorts, Timbers Resorts and several other smaller independent companies. In addition, the vacation ownership industry competes generally with other vacation rental options (such as hotels, resorts and condominium rentals) offered by the lodging industry as well as alternative lodging marketplaces such as Airbnb and HomeAway, which offer rentals of homes and condominiums. Innovations that impact the industry may also lead to new products and services that could disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors.
Outside North America, we operate vacation ownership resorts in two primary regions, Asia Pacific and Europe. In both regions, we are one of the largest lodging-branded vacation ownership companies operating in the upper upscale tier, with regional operators dominating the competitive landscape. Where possible, our vacation ownership properties in these regions are co-located with Marriott International branded hotels. In Asia Pacific, our owner base is derived primarily from the Asia Pacific region and secondarily from the Europe and North America regions. In Europe, our owner base is derived primarily from the North America, Europe and Middle East regions. 
Recent and potential future consolidation in the highly fragmented vacation ownership industry may increase competition. Consolidation may create competitors that enjoy significant advantages resulting from, among other things, a lower cost of, and greater access to, capital and enhanced operating efficiencies.
Competition in the vacation ownership industry may also increase as private competitors become publicly traded companies or existing publicly traded competitors spin-off their vacation ownership operations. For example, Wyndham Worldwide Corporation became Wyndham Destinations, Inc., a vacation ownership and exchange company, with the spin-off of its hotel operations in May 2018 and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. completed the spin-off of its vacation ownership operations in January 2017. Wyndham Destinations, Inc. and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. are now separate publicly traded companies. In November 2017, Bluegreen Vacations Corporation completed an initial public offering that resulted in approximately 10 percent of its stock being held by the public. Competitors that are publicly traded companies may benefit from a lower cost of, and greater access to, capital, as well as more focused management attention.
Our Interval International exchange business principally competes for developer and consumer market share with Wyndham Destinations, Inc.’s subsidiary, RCI. Our subsidiary, Trading Places International, and several third parties operate in this industry with a significantly more limited scope of available accommodations. This business also faces increasing competition from points‑based vacation clubs and large resort developers, which operate their own internal exchange systems to facilitate exchanges for owners of vacation ownership interests at their resorts as they increase in size and scope. Increased consolidation in the industry enhances this competition. In addition, vacation clubs and resort developers may have direct exchange relationships with other developers.
We believe that developers and owners associations generally choose to affiliate with an exchange network based on the quality of resorts participating in the network; the level of service provided to members; the range and level of support services; the flexibility of the exchange program; the demographics of the membership base; the costs for annual membership and exchanges; and the continuity of management and its strategic relationships within the industry.
Regulation 
Our business is heavily regulated. We are subject to a wide variety of complex international, national, federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies in jurisdictions around the world. We have proactively worked with ARDA to encourage the enactment of responsible consumer-protection legislation and state regulation that enhances the reputation and respectability of the overall vacation ownership industry. We believe that, over time, our vacation ownership products and services helped improve the public perception of the vacation ownership industry.
Some laws, regulations and policies may impact multiple areas of our business, such as securities, anti-discrimination, anti-fraud, data protection and security and anti-corruption and bribery laws and regulations or government economic sanctions, including applicable regulations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). The FCPA and similar anti-corruption and bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or generating business. The collection, use and protection of personal data of our customers, as well as the sharing of our customer data with affiliates and third parties, are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the United States and in other jurisdictions around the world, such as Europe’s new General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018. Other laws, regulations and policies primarily affect one of four areas of our business: real estate development activities; marketing and sales activities; lending activities; and resort management activities.
Real Estate Development Regulation
Our real estate development activities are regulated under a number of different timeshare, condominium and land sales disclosure statutes in many jurisdictions. We are generally subject to laws and regulations typically applicable to real estate development, subdivision, and construction activities, such as laws relating to zoning, land use restrictions, environmental regulation, accessibility, title transfers, title insurance and taxation. In the United States, these include, with respect to some of our products, the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. In addition, we are subject to laws in some jurisdictions that impose liability on property developers for construction defects discovered or repairs made by future owners of property developed by the developer.
Marketing and Sales Regulation
Our marketing and sales activities are closely regulated pursuant to laws and regulations enacted specifically for the vacation ownership and land sales industries, as well as a wide variety of laws and regulations that govern our marketing and sales activities in the jurisdictions in which we carry out such activities. These laws and regulations include the USA PATRIOT Act, Foreign Investment In Real Property Tax Act, the Federal Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act and fair housing statutes, U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and state “Little FTC Acts” and other laws and regulations governing unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices including unfair or deceptive trade practices and unfair competition, state attorney general regulations, anti-fraud laws, prize, gift and sweepstakes laws, real estate, title agency or insurance, travel insurance and other licensing or registration laws and regulations, anti-money laundering, consumer information privacy and security, breach 
notification, information sharing and telemarketing laws, home solicitation sales laws, tour operator laws, lodging certificate and seller of travel laws, securities laws, and other consumer protection laws.
Many jurisdictions, including many jurisdictions in the United States, Asia Pacific and Europe, require that we file detailed registration or offering statements with regulatory authorities disclosing certain information regarding the vacation ownership interests and other real estate interests we market and sell, such as information concerning the interests being offered, any projects, resorts or programs to which the interests relate, applicable condominium or vacation ownership plans, evidence of title, details regarding our business, the purchaser’s rights and obligations with respect to such interests, and a description of the manner in which we intend to offer and advertise such interests. Regulation outside the United States includes jurisdictions in which our clubs and resorts operate, such as the European Union, Singapore and Mexico, among others. Among other things, the European and Singaporean regulations: (1) require delivery of specified disclosure (some of which must be provided in a specific format or language) to purchasers; (2) require a specified “cooling off” rescission period after a purchase contract is signed; and (3) prohibit any advance payments during the “cooling off” rescission period.
We must obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities for our marketing and sales activities. Changes in circumstances or applicable law may necessitate the application for or modification of existing approvals. Currently, we are permitted to market and sell vacation ownership products in all 50 states and the District of Columbia in the United States and numerous countries in North and South America, the Caribbean, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. In Australia, our Marriott Vacation Club Destinations, Australia points-based program is subject to regulation as a “managed investment scheme” by the Australian Securities & Investments Commission. In some countries our vacation ownership products are marketed by third party brokers.
Laws in many jurisdictions in which we sell vacation ownership interests grant the purchaser of a vacation ownership interest the right to cancel a purchase contract during a specified rescission period following the later of the date the contract was signed or the date the purchaser received the last of the documents required to be provided by us.
In recent years, regulators in many jurisdictions have increased regulations and enforcement actions related to telemarketing operations, including requiring adherence to the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the “TCPA”) and similar “do not call” legislation. These measures have significantly increased the costs and reduced the efficiencies associated with telemarketing. While we continue to be subject to telemarketing risks and potential liability, we believe that our exposure to adverse effects from telemarketing legislation and enforcement is mitigated in some instances by the use of permission-based marketing, under which we obtain the permission of prospective purchasers to contact them in the future. We participate in various programs and follow certain procedures that we believe help reduce the possibility that we contact individuals who have requested to be placed on federal or state “do not call” lists, including subscribing to the federal and certain state “do not call” lists, and maintaining an internal “do not call” list.
Lending Regulation
Our lending activities are subject to a number of laws and regulations including those of applicable supervisory, regulatory and enforcement agencies such as, in the United States, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the FTC, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These laws and regulations, some of which contain exceptions applicable to the timeshare industry or may not apply to some of our products, may include, among others, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X, the Truth In Lending Act and Regulation Z, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Housing Act and implementing regulations, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices regulations and the Consumer Protection Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and the Bank Secrecy Act. Our lending activities are also subject to the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions, including, among others, laws and regulations related to consumer loans, retail installment contracts, mortgage lending, usury, fair debt collection practices, consumer debt collection practices, mortgage disclosure, lender or mortgage loan originator licensing and registration and anti-money laundering.
Resort Management Regulation
Our resort management activities are subject to laws and regulations regarding community association management, public lodging, food and beverage services, labor, employment, health care, health and safety, accessibility, discrimination, immigration, gaming, and the environment (including climate change). In addition, many jurisdictions in which we manage our resorts have statutory provisions that limit the duration of the initial and renewal terms of our management agreements for property owners’ associations and/or permit the property owners’ association for a resort to terminate our management agreement under certain circumstances (for example, upon a super-majority vote of the owners), even if we are not in default under the agreement.
Environmental Compliance and Awareness
The properties we manage or develop are subject to national, state and local laws and regulations that govern the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to protecting the environment. These laws and regulations include requirements that address health and safety; the use, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; and emission or discharge of wastes or other materials. We believe that our management and development of properties comply, in all material respects, with environmental laws and regulations. Our compliance with such provisions also has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, nor do we anticipate that such compliance will have a material impact in the future.
We take our commitment to protecting the environment seriously. We have collaborated with Audubon International to further the “greening” of our Marriott Vacation Club resorts in the U.S. through the Audubon Green Leaf Eco-Rating Program for Hotels. The Audubon partnership is just one of several programs incorporated into our green initiatives. We have more than 20 years of energy conservation experience that we have put to use in implementing our environmental strategy across all of our segments. This strategy includes further reducing energy and water consumption, expanding our portfolio of green resorts, including LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) certification, educating and inspiring associates and guests to support the environment, and embracing innovation.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 23,000 employees with an average length of service of nearly seven years. We believe our relations with our employees are very good.
