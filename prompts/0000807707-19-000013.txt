Acquisitions and Dispositions
Our most recent acquisition and disposition transactions are discussed below:
On April 18, 2017, Voxx acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Rosen Electronics LLC for cash consideration of $1,814. In addition, the Company agreed to pay a 2% fee related to future net sales of Rosen products for three years. The purpose of this acquisition was to increase the Company's market share and strengthen its intellectual property related to the rear seat entertainment market. Details of the tangible and intangible assets acquired are outlined in Note 2 "Business Acquisitions and Dispositions" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
On August 31, 2017 (the "Closing Date"), the Company completed its sale of Hirschmann Car Communication GmbH and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Hirschmann”) to a subsidiary of TE Connectivity Ltd ("TE").

The purchase price, at the exchange rate as of the close of business on the Closing Date approximated $177,000 and is subject to adjustment based upon the final working capital. The Hirschmann subsidiary group, which was included within the Automotive segment, qualified to be presented as a discontinued operation in accordance with ASC 205-20 beginning in the Company's Fiscal 2018 second quarter ending August 31, 2017. Refer to Note 2 "Business Acquisitions and Dispositions" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the sale of Hirschmann.
Strategy
Our objective is to grow our business both organically and through strategic acquisitions. We will drive the business organically by continued product development in new and emerging technologies that should increase gross margins and improve operating income. We are focused on expanding sales both domestically and internationally and broadening our customer and partner base as we bring these new products to our target markets. In addition, we plan to continue to acquire synergistic companies that would allow us to leverage our overhead, penetrate new markets and expand existing product categories. Notwithstanding the above, if the appropriate opportunity arises, the Company will explore the potential divestiture of a product line or business.
The key elements of our strategy are as follows:
Continue to build and capitalize on the VOXX family of brands. We believe the "VOXX" portfolio of brands is one of our greatest strengths and offers us significant opportunity for increased market penetration. Today, VOXX International has over 30 global brands in its portfolio, which provides the Company with the ability to bring to market products under brands that consumers know to be quality. In addition, with such a wide brand portfolio, we can manage channels and sell into multiple outlets as well as leverage relationships with distributors, retailers, aftermarket car dealers and expeditors, and to global OEMs. Finally, we are open to opportunities to license some of the brands as an additional use of the brands and as a growth strategy. 
Continue to maintain diversified, blue chip customer base. Voxx distributes products through a wide range of specialty and mass merchandise channels and has arrangements with tier-1 and tier-2 auto OEMs. OEM products account for approximately 20% of Fiscal 2019 sales from continuing operations. The top-five customers of the Company represented 25% of sales from continuing operations, and no single customer accounted for over 10% of Fiscal 2019 sales.
Capitalize on niche product and distribution opportunities in our target markets. Throughout our history, we have used our extensive distribution and supply networks to capitalize on niche product and distribution opportunities in the automotive, premium audio and consumer accessories categories. We will continue that focus as we remain committed to innovation, developing products internally and through our outsourced technology and manufacturing partners to provide our customers with products that are in demand by consumers.
Combine new, internal manufacturing capabilities with our proven outsourced manufacturing with industry partners. For years, VOXX International employed an outsourced manufacturing strategy that enabled the Company to deliver the latest technological advances without the fixed costs associated with manufacturing. In recent years, the Company has added manufacturing capabilities to produce select product lines, such as rear-seat entertainment systems, security related products, and high-end speakers. This 
5

blend of internal and outsourced manufacturing enables the Company to drive innovation, control product quality and speed time-to-market. 
Use innovative technology generation capabilities to enable us to build a robust pipeline of new products. Voxx has invested significantly in R&D. The Company uses a mix of internal and external R&D, internal and external manufacturing, and has a number of valuable trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names and other intellectual property. Through Voxx's focus on R&D, the Company has built a pipeline of new products across all three segments.
Leverage our domestic and international distribution network. VOXX International Corporation has a highly expansive distribution network. Our distribution network, which includes OEM's, car dealers, automotive manufacturers, various types of retailers and chain stores, mass merchandisers, distributors, e-commerce platforms, system integrators, communication network providers, smart grid manufacturers, banks, cinema operators, healthcare providers and equipment manufacturers, the U.S. military, and private security providers should allow us to increase our market penetration. We intend to capitalize on new and existing distribution outlets to further grow our business across our three operating segments, both domestically and abroad.
Grow our international presence. We have an international presence through our local subsidiaries in Europe, as well as operations in Canada and China. We also continue to export from our domestic operations in the United States. Our strategy remains to diversify our exposure to any particular geography, while expanding our product offerings and distribution touch points across the world.
Pursue strategic and complementary acquisitions. We continue to monitor economic and industry conditions in order to evaluate potential strategic and synergistic business acquisitions that are expected to allow us to leverage overhead, penetrate new markets and expand our existing business distribution. Over the past several years, the Company has employed an M&A strategy to build its brand portfolio and enhance its product offering in higher margin product categories, while at the same time, exiting lower margin and commoditized product lines, resulting in improved bottom-line performance. The Company is focused on continuing to grow organically, but may pursue opportunistic acquisitions to augment our automotive (primarily with OEM accounts), Consumer Accessories and Premium Audio segments.
Maintain disciplined acquisition criteria. Virtually all of our acquisitions have been made to strengthen our product offerings, customer reach and growth potential across our operating business segments. Our strategy remains to acquire complimentary businesses, products and/or assets in our Automotive, Premium Audio and Consumer Accessories operating segments. Additionally, acquisitions should have a gross margin structure equal to or higher than our consolidated gross margins, and we will continue to look for acquisitions where we can leverage our corporate overhead and resources. Furthermore, it is important that management remains with Voxx as part of the acquisition, as their legacy expertise, knowledge of both the inner workings of their respective companies and the end-markets they serve are paramount to successfully running operations and achieving growth. We also pursue acquisitions that will be accretive for the Company and its shareholders in the first year such acquisitions are made.
Rapidly integrate acquired businesses. One of the more compelling factors as to why acquired businesses choose VOXX International Corporation is that we are perceived as both a financial and strategic partner. We are operators, and companies view their association with us as a positive for the future of their businesses in that we can provide resources and support that others in our sector, or in the Private Equity community, cannot. Our strategy upon acquisition, and in the years that follow, is to leverage our corporate strengths and integrate acquisitions into our operations. We provide accounting, MIS, warehouse and logistics support, as well as a host of value-added services that enable acquired companies to lower their cost basis and improve profitability. In recent years, we have consolidated facilities in our German operations and in Indiana, where we brought our RCA® and Klipsch operating groups together. 
Improve bottom-line performance and generate sustainable shareholder returns. The Company has instituted an aggressive strategy in recent years to shift its product mix to higher-margin product categories, while controlling costs and strategically investing in its infrastructure. Additionally, during Fiscal 2019, the Company began a comprehensive SKU rationalization program to discontinue certain product lines and streamline the Company’s consumer accessory product lines to focus on offerings with longer life cycles, more sustainable gross margins, and better growth potential. The Company remains focused on growing its business organically, continuing to enhance its gross profit margins and leveraging its fixed overhead structure to generate sustainable returns for its stockholders.
Industry
We participate in selected product categories in the automotive, premium audio and consumer accessories markets within the electronics industry. These markets are large and diverse, encompass a broad range of products and offer the ability to specialize in niche product groups. The introduction of new products and technological advancements are the major growth drivers in these 
6

markets.  Based on this, we continue to introduce new products across all segments, with an increased focus on niche product offerings.

Also, all of our products are subject to price fluctuations, which could affect the carrying value of inventories and gross margins in the future.

Patents, Trademarks/Tradenames, Licensing and Royalties
The Company regards its trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, and similar intellectual property as important to its operations. It relies on trademark, copyright and patent law, domain name regulations, and confidentiality or license agreements to protect its proprietary rights. The Company has registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of patents, trademarks, domain names and copyrights by U.S. and foreign governmental authorities. Additionally, the Company has filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of its proprietary technology. The Company renews its registrations, which vary in duration, as it deems appropriate from time to time.
The Company has licensed in the past, and expects that it may license in the future, certain of its proprietary rights to third parties. Some of the Company's products are designed to include intellectual property, licensed or otherwise obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company's products, the Company believes, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms; however, there is no guarantee such licenses could be obtained at all. We intend to operate in a way that does not result in willful infringement of the patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights of other parties. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that a claim of infringement will not be asserted against us or that any such assertion will not result in a judgment or order requiring us to obtain a license in order to make, use, or sell our products.
License and royalty programs offered to our manufacturers, customers and other electronic suppliers are structured using a fixed amount per unit or a percentage of net sales, depending on the terms of the agreement. Current license and royalty agreements have duration periods which range from 1 to 12 years or continue in perpetuity. Certain agreements may be renewed at termination of the agreement. The Company's license and royalty income is recorded upon sale and amounted to $1,382, $1,538 and $1,669 for the years ended February 28, 2019, February 28, 2018 and February 28, 2017, respectively.

The Company also employs a direct ship model from our suppliers for select customers upon their request.
Product Development, Warranty and Customer Service
Our product development cycle includes:

• | identifying consumer trends and potential demand,

9


• | responding to those trends through product design and feature integration, which includes software design, electrical engineering, industrial design and pre-production testing. In the case of OEM customers, the product development cycle may also include product validation to customer quality standards, and


• | evaluating and testing new products in our own facilities to ensure compliance with our design specifications and standards.

Utilizing our company-owned and third-party facilities in the United States, Europe and Asia, we work closely with our suppliers throughout the product design, testing and development process in an effort to meet the expectations of consumer demand for technologically-advanced and high-quality products. Our Auburn Hills, Michigan and Orlando, Florida facilities are both IATF 16949:2016 certified, and our Orlando, Florida facility is ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 9001:2008 certified, all of which require the monitoring of quality standards in all facets of business. The Orlando, Florida facility is also Ford Q1 certified, which is a certification awarded to Ford suppliers who demonstrate excellence beyond the ISO certifications in certain critical areas.
We provide product warranties for all of our product lines, which primarily range from 30 days to three years.

To support our warranties, we have independent warranty centers in the United States and Europe.  Our customer service group, along with our Company websites, provide product information, answer questions and serve as a technical hotline for installation help for end-users and customers.
Suppliers
We work directly with our suppliers on industrial design, feature sets, product development and testing in order to ensure that our products and component parts meet our design specifications.
We purchase our products and component parts from manufacturers principally located in several Pacific Rim countries, including China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, as well as the United States, Canada, Mexico and Europe. In selecting our manufacturers, we consider quality, price, service, reputation, financial stability, as well as labor practices, disruptions, or shortages. In order to provide coordination and supervision of supplier performance such as price negotiations, delivery and quality control, we maintain buying and inspection offices in China and Hong Kong.  We consider relations with our suppliers to be good and alternative sources of supply are generally available within 120 days.  We have few long-term contracts with our suppliers and we generally purchase our products under short-term purchase orders.  Although we believe that alternative sources of supply are currently available, an unplanned shift to a new supplier could result in product delays and increased cost, which may have a material impact on our operations.
Competition
The electronics industry is highly competitive across all product categories, and we compete with a number of well-established companies that manufacture and sell similar products. Brand name, design, advancement of technology and features as well as price are the major competitive factors within the electronics industry.  Our Automotive products compete against factory-supplied products, including those provided by, among others, General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler; large Tier 1's, such as Denso, Panasonic, LG, Continental, Lear, and Bosch; as well as against major companies in the automotive aftermarket, such as Sony, Panasonic, Kenwood, Directed Electronics, Autopage, Myron and Davis, Phillips, Insignia, and Pioneer.
