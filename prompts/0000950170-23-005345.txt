 Item 1. Business.
We are a precision oncology company pioneering the discovery and development of small molecule, tumor-agnostic therapies targeting p53. p53 is a well-defined tumor suppressor protein known as the “guardian of the genome,” and normal, or wild-type, p53 has the ability to eliminate cancer cells. However, mutant p53 proteins can be misfolded and lose their wild-type tumor suppressing function. These p53 mutations are found in approximately half of all cancers. The field of p53 biology was established by our co-founder Dr. Arnold Levine when he discovered the p53 protein in 1979. We have leveraged more than four decades of research experience and developed unique insights into p53 to create a precision oncology platform designed to generate selective, small molecule, tumor-agnostic therapies that structurally correct specific mutant p53 proteins to restore their wild-type function. We are deploying our precision oncology platform to target the top ten most frequent, or hotspot, p53 mutations that are collectively associated with approximately 10-15% of all cancers. In addition, we continue to utilize our platform to target other p53-related cancers.
 Our lead product candidate, PC14586, is an orally available small molecule designed to potently and selectively correct p53 misfolding caused by a specific p53 mutation, Y220C, while sparing wild-type p53. The Y220C mutation is associated with 1.0-1.5% of all cancers, including breast, non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, colorectal, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. PC14586 is designed to restore the wild-type conformation by occupying the crevice created by the tyrosine to cysteine mutation in amino acid position 220. While we are in the early stages of discovery and development of our product candidates and our novel approach is unproven, we are initially pursuing a tumor-agnostic development strategy and initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in October 2020. Our strategy is to seek approval under an accelerated pathway, and we believe our Phase 1/2 clinical trial has the potential to serve as a pivotal study. In October 2020, we were granted U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, Fast Track designation of PC14586 for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that have a p53 Y220C mutation. We presented our preliminary Phase 1 clinical data in June 2022 and we continue to enroll patients in this trial. In December 2022, we opened a separate arm within the existing Phase 1/2 clinical trial combining PC14586 with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in collaboration with Merck and Co. In addition, we are leveraging our precision oncology platform to develop a pipeline of oral small molecule product candidates that structurally correct other p53 hotspot mutations to restore their wild-type function and product candidates that target other p53-related cancers.
 A better understanding of mutations that drive cancers have facilitated the development of precise, gene- and protein-specific drugs known as targeted therapies. Targeted therapies have the potential to transform treatment of some cancers by providing robust clinical benefit to patients. In many cases, clinical responses can be dramatic enough to support expedited regulatory approval of these therapies. Further, recent advancements in next-generation-sequencing, or genomic NGS, have accelerated the development of targeted therapies. A recent study found that 75% of oncologists in the United States employ genetic sequencing. We believe p53 mutations are particularly well-suited for the evolving precision oncology paradigm, as a single mutation can cause p53 malfunction, and p53 is one of the genes commonly sequenced, to our knowledge, in NGS panels. We believe that our precision oncology platform offers a substantial opportunity to expand the number of patients who will benefit from targeted therapies.
 Our innovation engine consists of three complementary drivers:
 •deep understanding of, and leadership in, p53 biology that enable unique insights into drugging individual mutations as well as targeting other p53-related cancers;
 •ability to design on a structural basis selective, oral small molecule product candidates; and 
 •assays, screens, preclinical model systems and biomarkers that enable us to assess and optimize orally available selective small molecule drug product candidates for specific p53 mutants, and for inhibitors of wild-type p53 function
 

PC14586 and Pipeline
 We are leveraging our precision oncology platform to develop a pipeline of orally available, potent and highly selective small molecule product candidates that are designed to structurally correct specific mutant p53 proteins to restore their wild-type function. In addition, we are expanding the utilization of our platform to target other p53-related cancers.
 An overview of our development pipeline is shown in the table below.
 



(1)In Discovery, we screen compounds against biological assays to identify lead compounds.
 (2)In Lead Optimization, we modify the lead compound to improve potency, selectivity, pharmacokinetic and toxicity parameters and physical chemical properties important for clinical development.
 (3)In IND-Enabling Studies, we conduct preclinical studies, in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, required for an IND submission to the FDA.
 Our lead product candidate, PC14586, is designed to be an orally available small molecule that structurally corrects the mutant p53 protein with the Y220C mutation. The Y220C mutation results from tyrosine being substituted by a cysteine at amino acid position 220 and is associated with 1.0-1.5% of all cancers, including breast, NSCLC, colorectal, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. There are currently no products approved by the FDA, and we are not aware of any other products in clinical development, that selectively target the p53 Y220C mutation.
 PC14586 is designed to bind to the mutation site and structurally correct the misfolded p53 protein, while sparing wild-type p53. Our approach has yielded a highly selective product candidate, which we believe can maximize the potential therapeutic potency and minimize risk to normal functioning cells. In preclinical studies, PC14586 has shown selective on-target activity (i.e., primarily functions in cells with the p53 Y220C mutation) and exhibited robust anti-tumor activity evidenced by potent tumor growth inhibition, or TGI, and strong tumor regression as a single agent. Further, preclinical studies have demonstrated significant synergistic effects in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy.
 

We initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for PC14586 in October 2020. In addition, we were granted FDA Fast Track designation of PC14586 for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that have a p53 Y220C mutation in October 2020. We dosed our first patient in this clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Phase 1 portion of the trial is designed to evaluate escalating doses of PC14586 to determine the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, and recommended Phase 2 dose of PC14586 when administered orally to patients. Safety, tolerability and effects on biomarkers such as macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1, or MIC-1, will also be assessed. The Phase 1 portion is also designed to assess preliminary anti-tumor efficacy in patients with advanced solid tumors that have the p53 Y220C mutation. In June 2022, we presented initial Phase 1 data, as of a May 10, 2022 efficacy data cutoff date, from our Phase 1/2 clinical trial at the 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting: PC14586 was generally well-tolerated and the MTD was determined to be 1500mg BID. A total of 41 patients with the p53 Y220C mutation were enrolled, including 25 patients with measurable disease who were treated in the efficacious dose range, which was defined as a dose from 1150mg QD to 1500mg BID. In the efficacious dose range, partial responses were observed by investigator review (RECIST v1.1) in 32% (six confirmed partial responses and two partial responses pending confirmation as of May 10, 2022) across six different tumor types.
 We believe the mechanism of action employed by PC14586 to structurally correct a specific p53 mutant and restore wild-type p53 activity could provide benefit to patients and offer a unique value proposition in oncology, and is a strategy that can be pursued broadly across other p53 mutations. To that point, we are developing a pipeline of candidates targeting other p53 hotspot mutations. We have other preclinical programs that have demonstrated biochemical validation, for which we are leveraging knowledge from our PC14586 Y220C program. We believe we can scale our discovery and development principles across all p53 hotspot mutations to streamline the process of further developing our pipeline.
 In addition to targeting p53 hotspot mutants, we believe that our expertise and platform can also be applied to target other p53-related cancers. We are deploying our deep understanding of structure-based small molecule design, assays, screens, preclinical model systems and biomarkers to create a pipeline of therapeutics in this field. We believe that we can continue to scale our platform to develop novel therapeutics that structurally correct mutant p53 or other p53-related cancers.
 Our Strategy
 Our vision is to become a leading precision oncology company by designing, developing and commercializing novel precision medicines for every patient with a p53-driven tumor. We believe we are well positioned to leverage our deep experience in p53 biology, precision oncology platform and foundational knowledge acquired through our lead program to bring these therapies to patients. The critical components of our strategy include:
 •Advancing our lead product candidate, PC14586, as a tumor-agnostic, oral small molecule therapy for cancer patients. We have designed PC14586 to be an orally available, tumor-agnostic therapeutic and, if approved, we believe it could become the first agent to address the p53 Y220C mutation-defined patient population. In October 2020, we initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for PC14586 in multiple solid tumors with the p53 Y220C mutation. We plan to conduct our clinical trials in this genetically-defined patient population and leverage learnings from recently approved tumor-agnostic drugs to inform the clinical and regulatory pathways for PC14586. In June 2022, we presented our initial Phase 1 clinical data for PC14586 and observed partial responses across six different tumor types. In December 2022, we opened a separate arm within the existing Phase 1/2 clinical trial, to evaluate the combination of PC14586 with Merck’s KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring a p53 Y220C mutation.
 

•Harnessing the power of our precision oncology platform to discover and develop additional differentiated product candidates that are designed to precisely target p53 mutant protein and inhibitors of wild-type p53 in cancer. We believe that the general principles for our PC14586 Y220C program can be applied to other p53 hotspot mutations. Using our extensive in-house expertise, deep understanding of chemistry and decades of experience researching the p53 protein, we believe that we will be able to leverage and apply foundational knowledge from the advancement of PC14586 to the discovery and development of small molecules targeting other p53 mutations. We are advancing several early-stage programs focused on targeting the p53 hotspot mutations and other p53-related cancers. In an ongoing effort to bring forward new product candidates, we plan to continue to invest in our precision oncology platform, including our high-throughput screens that allow for quantitative visualization of the conversion from mutant to wild-type p53 in a dose-dependent manner. 
 •Leveraging the advantages of precision medicine and our expertise in p53 biology to pursue accelerated approval of our product candidates. For our lead product candidate, PC14586, we are actively working with physicians and leading academic centers to enroll patients with the p53 Y220C mutation identified through NGS in our Phase 1/2 clinical trial. In order to rapidly confirm mechanistic and clinical proof of concept, we utilize assays to measure target engagement and biomarkers, as well as assess clinical responses in patients. We expect this strategy, which we also plan to replicate for our other future product candidates, will enable a rapid determination of target engagement and has potential to serve as a predictive marker of efficacy, thereby providing clear decision points for clinical development and efficient advancement of our product candidates towards approval. If we obtain early and encouraging clinical results, we may seek breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA, which, if granted, is intended to expedite clinical development and regulatory review. We intend to maximize the benefit of our product candidates by pursuing a tumor-agnostic approach.
 •Identifying and exploring combination therapy approaches for our product candidates. Though PC14586 has demonstrated clear and robust tumor regression as a single agent in preclinical animal models, we believe that the mechanism of correcting the structure of mutant p53 can be complementary to other oncology therapies. Leveraging our expertise in p53 biology, chemistry and cancer pharmacology, we plan to identify and explore combination strategies with multiple cancer therapies. For example, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, approaches that result in deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, damage and upregulate p53 are natural candidates for combining with our product candidates. In addition, we believe that p53 plays a role in influencing the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 agents, could also be considered as potential combination agents for use with our product candidates. We believe that our unique expertise will enable us to prioritize therapeutic strategies and optimize outcomes for clinical studies.
 Background on Targeted Therapies
 Cancer is a genetic disease that results from changes in a person’s DNA that causes cells to grow and divide uncontrollably. Genes are the distinct segments in a cell’s DNA that can encode proteins with structural or functional roles in the body. Alterations in some genes can lead to the expression of mutant proteins with impaired or abnormal functions that can cause cancer. Cancer has historically been both diagnosed and treated based on a tumor’s organ site, such as the breast, lung, ovary, brain, pancreas, skin, bone or blood.
 

Recent advances in genetic sequencing and a better understanding of the genetic alterations that drive tumor development and growth have facilitated precise, gene and protein-specific drug development, known as targeted therapies. Targeted therapies have the potential to transform treatment of some cancers by providing robust clinical benefit to patients. In notable cases, the clinical outcomes have been dramatic enough to support expedited regulatory approval of these therapies. For example, Retevmo in RET-altered NSCLC and thyroid cancers (Lilly/Loxo); Ayvakit, in platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha exon 18 mutated advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor, or GIST (Blueprint); Rozlytrek, in solid tumors with a neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase, or NTRK, gene fusion (Roche); Vitrakvi, in solid tumors with an NTRK gene fusion (Loxo/Bayer); Zykadia, in anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive, or ALK+, advanced NSCLC (Novartis); Zelboraf, in advanced melanoma with a BRAF V600E mutation (Roche Genentech); Xalkori, in ALK+ advanced NSCLC (Pfizer); Tagrisso, in epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive, or EGFR+, advanced NSCLC (AstraZeneca); Qinlock, in GIST (Deciphera), and Krazati and Lumakras in KRAS G12C mutated NSCLC (Mirati and Amgen) all received approvals within five years of first dosing in humans. This time period is significantly reduced compared to conventional drug development timelines. Despite this progress, a recent analysis found that only 8% of patients with metastatic cancer have tumors with genetic profiles eligible for treatment with an approved targeted agent, which leaves a large opportunity for precision oncology.
There is an emerging change in the development of targeted therapies, in that cancer is increasingly being targeted through a tumor-agnostic approach with a focus on selectively targeting a genetic or protein mutation irrespective of tumor type. For example, there are now multiple tumor-agnostic product approvals that are based on a genetic mutation that defines the disease, as opposed to the tumor type. These include the aforementioned Vitrakvi and Rozlytrek approvals as well as KEYTRUDA and Jemperli, respectively, approval in metastatic microsatellite instability-high, or MSI-high, or deficient mismatch repair, or dMMR, solid tumors. KEYTRUDA is also approved in tumor mutational burden-high-(TMB-H) solid tumors. In addition, the combination of Taflinar and Mekinist was approved for BRAF V600E mutation positive unresectable or metastatic solid tumors (with the exception of colorectal cancer). We believe that these approvals represent a fundamental shift in the development of targeted therapies and will increasingly lead to cancer being characterized for treatment in a genetic, rather than in a tumor-specific, manner, based on a biological rationale.
 The widespread recognition that cancer is a genetic disease, as much as it is a disease defined by histology or anatomical location, has driven the increased use of genetic sequencing, which is now employed by approximately 75% of oncologists in the United States. As DNA sequencing technology advances, the availability of well-defined genetic sequencing tests increases. With the increasing number of approved targeted therapies, we believe that physicians will seek a better understanding of the underlying genetic and protein abnormalities associated with a specific type of cancer in order to determine the optimal course of treatment. Advances in genetic sequencing are leading to transformations in the discovery and development of new targeted oncology drugs.
 We believe p53 mutations are prime targets for precision oncology, as more than 50% of all human cancers contain a p53 mutation. Identifying the specific p53 gene mutation and structurally correcting the corresponding mutant p53 protein can potentially serve as a basis of treatment for these cancers. Diagnostic tests are currently used by physicians in their practice to identify patients with p53 mutations. Given the high prevalence of p53 mutations in cancers, we believe that an effective way to address p53-driven cancers is by targeting individual p53 mutations using a precision oncology approach and significantly expanding the scope of patients who can benefit from targeted therapies. In addition, we believe that our platform can also be leveraged to expand our pipeline by identifying targets that modulate wild-type p53. Given our deep understanding of and expertise in p53 biology, we believe that pursuing product candidates that target inhibitors of wild-type p53 can also expand the scope of patients who can benefit from targeted therapies.
 Background on p53, the Most Frequently Mutated Gene in Human Cancer
 The p53 gene provides instructions for the production of tumor suppression protein p53 and is the most widely mutated gene in human cancers. Since its discovery in 1979 by our co-founder Dr. Arnold Levine, p53 has been extensively studied by researchers and the pharmaceutical industry due to its central role in preventing the initiation and proliferation of liquid and solid tumors. p53 has long been referred to as the “guardian of the genome” because it regulates expression of a number of genes that comprise the body’s first line of cellular defense against cancers. Among its multiple biologic functions, p53 regulates a variety of tumor suppressive responses including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, senescence and apoptosis.
 

p53 is a transcriptional factor, which binds to the promoters of its target genes in a sequence-specific manner and regulates their expression, thereby controlling cell cycle and cell death. p53 is activated when DNA damage is detected and when oxidative or other cellular stresses exceed thresholds for normal cellular function. p53 activation facilitates the repair of the cell’s damaged DNA or triggers the killing of the damaged cell through a process known as programmed cell death, or apoptosis, before the cell can become cancerous and proliferate.
 Under normal cellular conditions, p53 is kept at low levels by expression of murine double minute 2, or MDM2, a ubiquitin ligase that promotes the degradation of p53. Upon p53 activation by damaged DNA, and other types of stresses, p53 is upregulated and blocks the proliferation of pre-malignant and malignant cells or eliminates them by inducing apoptosis. Mutant p53 loses the ability to eliminate the proliferation of pre-malignant and malignant cells. Given that the mutational status of p53 in a tumor has a strong impact on sensitivity to commonly used anti-cancer drugs and radiotherapy, p53 is important both as a biomarker and as a novel therapeutic target.
 A key challenge in the development of p53-targeted therapies is the vast number of p53 mutants that lose tumor suppression activity. To date, more than 25,000 unique p53 mutations have been discovered. The p53 hotspot mutations occur as a result of site-specific substitution of one amino acid for another and lead to loss of tumor suppression function for the p53 protein. Strategies that attempt to restore wild-type p53 activity in a non-selective manner (i.e., regardless of which p53 mutation the tumor is harboring) are likely to face significant challenges, as a “one size fits all” drug is unlikely to address all p53 mutants and could have the potential for off-target toxicities. We are focusing on targeting the p53 hotspot mutations and other p53-related cancers.

R175H | 5.6% 
R248Q | 4.4% 
R273H | 4.0% 
R248W | 3.5% 
R273C | 3.3% 
R282W | 2.8% 
G245S | 2.1% 
R249S | 2.0% 
Y220C | 1.8% 
V157F | 1.0% 

Our Approach to Targeting p53
 Our goal is to bring precision oncology therapies to a greater number of patients. Decades of p53 research has unveiled its potential as a precision oncology target, but prior drug development efforts have been unsuccessful. Mutant p53 historically has been classified as “undruggable” due to the difficulty of restoring wild-type p53 function. Mutations in p53 can give rise to mutant p53 proteins with different conformational structures. As a result, we are designing oral small molecule therapies that selectively target a specific p53 mutation while not binding to wild-type p53. We believe our novel approach designed to reactivate p53 function through the structural correction of mutant p53 protein to wild-type p53 represents a novel therapeutic strategy to target p53.
 Our drug development efforts leverage our understanding that:
 

•mutations throughout the p53 protein can drive tumor formation and growth;
 •a mutant p53 protein resulting from a specific mutation can potentially be structurally corrected by a selective small molecule, thereby reactivating wild-type p53 activity;
 •the p53 hotspot mutations comprise approximately 30% of all p53 mutations and each p53 hotspot mutation represents an individual therapeutic target for drug discovery and development; and
 •in addition to p53 mutant cancers, certain cancers result when wild-type p53 function is inhibited. 
 We believe we can address certain key limitations of current-generation precision oncology therapies by applying our platform to identify and generate therapies that address functional deficiencies associated with specific p53 mutations and other p53-related cancers. We believe this will allow us to design and develop potential therapies for patients with a high unmet medical need for whom there are currently no targeted treatment options.
 Our Innovation Engine
 We have built an innovation engine that allows us to discover and develop potential targeted therapies for mutant p53-driven cancers and other p53-related cancers. This engine consists of three complementary drivers:
 •Deep understanding of, and leadership in, p53 biology that enable unique insights into targeting individual mutations and targeting other p53-related cancers. We have leveraged more than four decades of research experience and developed unique insights into p53 biology, a field that was discovered and established by our co-founder Dr. Arnold Levine. Additionally, our SAB consists of some of the most prominent thought leaders in p53 biology. p53 is a highly complex gene, and thousands of distinct p53 mutations have been identified. A blanket approach to targeting mutant p53 has significant challenges, as a “one size fits all” drug is unlikely to address all p53 mutants. Based on our experience and expertise, we are developing oral small molecules that each selectively structurally correct a specific p53 hotspot mutation. 
 •Ability to design structure-based oral small molecule product candidates that selectively target and correct specific p53 mutants and inhibitors of wild-type p53. Designing molecules for p53 mutants requires an intricate understanding of the p53 protein structure and the associated biology. We leverage structure-based technologies to give our oral small molecule product candidates access to challenging binding sites that are generally not accessible using conventional small molecule drug discovery approaches. For each target, we take detailed data from structural and functional studies of mutated p53 proteins to design development candidates against the challenging binding sites. Our design techniques help us to identify potential product candidates that can selectively target a single p53 mutant, while sparing wild-type p53.
 •Assays, screens, preclinical model systems and biomarkers that enable us to assess and optimize selective small molecule product candidates. We test our product candidates across a diverse set of human cancer cells based on research and understanding of bioinformatics and functional genomics. We also identify and monitor pharmacodynamic biomarkers and surrogates of clinical activity to help measure target engagement, including MIC-1, a serum-based biomarker. The biological insights we generate help us to better target various p53 mutants based on their structure and biology. In addition, we have built assays, screens and preclinical model systems and biomarkers that help assess and optimize our product candidates that target other p53-related cancers. We develop innovative preclinical in vitro and in vivo models to advance potential therapeutic programs for translation to the clinic.
Our Product Candidate and Development Programs
 We are leveraging our precision oncology platform to develop a pipeline of oral small molecule product candidates that structurally correct other p53 hotspot mutations to restore their wild-type function and product candidates that target other p53-related cancers. We own worldwide commercial rights to all of our programs. An overview of our development pipeline is shown in the table below.
 


(1)In Discovery, we screen compounds against biological assays to identify lead compounds.
 (2)In Lead Optimization, we modify the lead compound to improve potency, selectivity, pharmacokinetic and toxicity parameters and physical chemical properties important for clinical development.
 (3)In IND-Enabling Studies, we conduct preclinical studies, in accordance with GLP required for an IND submission to the FDA.
 We expect to initially seek approval of our product candidates in most instances, including with PC14586, at least as a second line therapy or for patients with no satisfactory alternative treatments or where the cancer has progressed following other treatment. Subsequently, depending on the nature of the clinical data and experience with any approved products or product candidates, if any, we may pursue approval as an earlier line therapy and potentially as a first line therapy. Cancer therapies are sometimes characterized as first line, second line or third line, and the FDA customarily approves new therapies for a second line or later lines of use. When cancer is detected early enough, first line therapy is sometimes adequate to cure the cancer or prolong life without a cure. Whenever first line therapies, usually chemotherapy, antibody drugs, tumor-targeted small molecules, hormone therapy, radiation therapy, surgery or a combination of these, proves unsuccessful, second line therapies may be administered. Second line therapies often consist of more chemotherapy, radiation, antibody drugs, tumor-targeted small molecules, or a combination of these. Third line therapies can include chemotherapy, antibody drugs and small molecule tumor-targeted therapies, more invasive forms of surgery and new technologies.
 PC14586: A Selective Structural Corrector of p53 Y220C Mutations
 p53 is the most widely mutated gene in human cancers. The vast majority of these mutations occur as a result of missense mutations that are found in the DNA binding domain. p53 Y220C mutations are found in approximately 1.0-1.5% of all cancers. This particular mutation is expressed in a large variety of solid tumors, including breast, NSCLC, colorectal, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. Our lead product candidate, PC14586, is designed to be an orally available small molecule that structurally corrects a p53 protein containing the Y220C mutation and restores wild-type p53 function.
 

Wild-type p53 in a normal cell is at low to undetectable levels, but an external insult such as UV radiation or exposure to a carcinogen results in activation and upregulation of the protein. In these instances, wild-type p53 pauses the cell-cycle to survey the integrity of the genome, and if the damage to the genome cannot be repaired, wild-type p53 induces a potent program of cell suicide or programed cell death. Given wild-type p53’s profound ability to induce cell death, it is tightly regulated in normal biology by an auto-regulatory loop with MDM2, a downstream induced target of wild-type p53 transcriptional activation. MDM2 production results in degradation of the wild-type p53 protein and re-sets the cell to normal function.
 In the case of a mutant p53, there is a loss of p53 wild-type tumor suppression function due to a loss of downstream wild-type p53 transcriptional activation, including MDM2 induction. A consequence of this dysregulation is the inability of the cancer cell to degrade mutant forms of p53, resulting in a profound accumulation of mutant p53 protein in the cancer cell.
 
While treatment options such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immuno-therapy are available for breast, NSCLC, colorectal, pancreatic and ovarian cancer, there are no approved precision oncology therapies for the subset of patients with the p53 Y220C mutation. The availability of an oral small molecule selective for the p53 Y220C mutation may offer a novel precision therapy for this population, which we believe could potentially change the treatment paradigm for such patients.
 Mechanism of Action
 PC14586 is an orally available small molecule candidate that is designed to selectively bind to the crevice created by the p53 Y220C mutation, and thereby restore the wild-type p53 protein structure and tumor suppressing function. In the diagram below, wild-type p53 protein is compared with a mutant p53 Y220C protein and a mutant p53 Y220C protein with PC14586 bound in the crevice created by the Y220C mutation. By docking into the crevice created by the Y220C mutation, PC14586 is designed to restore the wild-type p53 conformation and function.
 


In preclinical studies, we have demonstrated that PC14586 rapidly converts the large protein pool of mutant p53 Y220C protein to wild-type structure. As seen in the graphic below, in an in vitro study, PC14586 induced conversion of p53 protein from mutant to wild-type conformation in a dose-dependent manner as evidenced by a decrease in mutant p53 and an increase in wild-type p53, while total p53 remains relatively unchanged.
 

PC14586 Demonstrated Structural Conversion from Mutant p53 to Wild-type p53 in vitro
 


PC14586 selectively binds to the crevice created by the Y220C mutation as this molecule does not bind to wild-type p53 or other p53 mutations, including R273H, R273C, R175H, G245S, R248Q and R282W, as demonstrated by the lack of activity (as measured by p21 and MDM2 gene expression seen in the below diagrams). PC14586 only binds to the crevice created by the Y220C mutation, and none of the other tested p53 hotspot mutations, as illustrated by gene expression changes in the Y220C cell line when PC14586 is added in increasing concentrations.
 Additionally, structural correction from a mutant p53 Y220C conformation to a wild-type p53 conformation by PC14586 restored p53-dependent transcription of downstream targets, which is indicative of wild-type p53 biological activity. For example, as shown in the figures below, p21 and MDM2, two of the downstream targets of p53, were selectively upregulated by PC14586 in a dose-dependent manner in cells where the p53 Y220C mutation was present. Since PC14586 is highly selective for the p53 Y220C mutation, it did not affect expression levels of p21 and MDM2 in tumor cell lines containing wild-type p53, p53 knock-out or other p53 hotspot mutations as noted in the figures below.

Preclinical In Vivo Data
 PC14586 exhibited single-agent anti-tumor activity in a dose-dependent manner against mutant p53 Y220C tumors, evidenced by both potent TGI and tumor regression. Oral once-daily dosing over 21 days of PC14586 was well tolerated in nude mice (ten mice per dosing group) bearing p53 Y220C NUGC3 xenograft tumors up to 100 mg/kg, as evidenced by the lack of body weight loss, which is the generally accepted surrogate for toxicity in mice. PC14586 demonstrated dose-dependent TGI at daily doses ranging from 25 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg and robust tumor regression at 100 mg/kg daily.
PC14586 Single-Agent Administration in NUGC3 Xenograft Model Resulted in Tumor Regression and was Well Tolerated
 


We also created a human p53 knock-in, or HUPKI, mouse that expresses a p53 protein with the human p53 DNA binding domain and the p53 Y220C mutation. The HUPKI mouse presents spontaneously with sarcomas at six to eight months of age, which we can harvest and re-implant in a wild-type mouse to create a mouse tumor model that has an intact immune system harboring a human p53 Y220C mutation. We believe this syngeneic mouse model better represents the patient population that we expect to see in the clinic, as compared to mouse xenograft models that incorporate human tumors in mice with no immune system. While some patients with cancer may have weakened immune systems, we believe that few patients have severely or fully dysfunctional immunocompromised systems, and therefore a syngeneic model may better represent the patient population than an immunocompromised mouse model. In addition, with an intact immune system, this model allows us to test anti-tumor activity of PC14586 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
 As illustrated by the table below, PC14586, administered as a single-agent at a daily oral dose of 100 mg/kg for 70 days, demonstrated regression in tumors that express the p53 Y220C mutation in the syngeneic mouse model. The durability of the response was measured by median survival, where median survival for a 100 mg/kg dose of PC14586 exceeded 156 days, even though drug treatment was discontinued on day 70. This compared with median survival of only 17 days for the vehicle.

 PC14586 also exhibited anti-tumor activity in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy in syngeneic mouse models with the human p53 Y220C mutation. The scientific rationale for such a combination comes from the emerging literature suggesting an interplay between p53 and the immune system, which is the key mechanism of action of cancer immunotherapies such as anti-PD-1 antibodies. When PC14586 was administered at a sub-therapeutic daily oral dose of 50 mg/kg for 70 days in combination with a therapeutic dose of a PD-1 antibody, regression of tumors that express the p53 Y220C mutation was observed. As illustrated by the table below, median survival for a sub-therapeutic dose of PC14586 combined with anti-PD-1 treatment exceeded 156 days, even though drug treatment was discontinued on day 70, compared with median survival of only 24 days for anti-PD-1 treatment alone.

 Clinical Development Plan of PC14586
 We initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, PYNNACLE, for PC14586 in October 2020. In addition, we were granted FDA Fast Track designation of PC14586 for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with a p53 Y220C mutation in October 2020. We dosed our first patient in this clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2020.
In June 2022, we provided an update on the Phase 1/2 trial at the 2022 American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. The interim data, as of a May 10, 2022 efficacy data cutoff date, included enrollment of 41 patients with the p53 Y220C mutation, 33 of whom had measurable disease and were included in the primary analysis. Patients in the study had a median age of 62 (range of 32-74 years of age) with a range of tumor types and were heavily pretreated with a median of three prior lines of therapy. Of these patients, 25 patients with measurable disease were treated in the efficacious dose range, which was defined as a dose from 1150mg QD to 1500mg BID. In the efficacious dose range, partial responses were observed by investigator review (RECIST v1.1) in 32% (six confirmed partial responses and two partial responses pending confirmation as of the cutoff date) across six different tumor types. Best response of stable disease (SD) or PR was observed in 19 of the 25 patients (76%) in the efficacious dose range.


In the ongoing monotherapy dose escalation phase of our trial, we continue to enroll patients to evaluate the preliminary safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of PC14586 to establish the recommended dose for Phase 2.

PC14586 was observed to be generally well-tolerated (across 41 patients treated with PC14586 monotherapy as of May 10, 2022). The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate (Grade 1 or 2) in severity with the most frequent adverse events being nausea, vomiting, aspartate transaminase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) increase, anemia, blood creatine increase and fatigue.
PC14586 in a Clinical Collaboration with Merck
 As a result of the preclinical combination data with PC14586 and an anti-PD1 antibody, we are evaluating this combination in patients. In July 2022, we announced a clinical collaboration agreement with Merck to evaluate the combination of PC14586 and Merck’s anti-PD1 antibody, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), in patients with advanced solid tumors in patients with a p53 Y220C mutation. This study is being conducted as a separate arm of our ongoing Phase 1/2 PYNNACLE trial in patients with advanced solid tumors. Approximately 36 patients are expected to be enrolled in the combination arm of the trial. This combination arm will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of PC14586 in combination with KEYTRUDA in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring a p53 Y220C mutation. Under the terms of the agreement, we will sponsor the trial and Merck will supply KEYTRUDA. In December 2022, we initiated enrollment in the PC14586 + pembrolizumab arm of the PYNNACLE study.


R282W: Our Second Mutant p53 Program
 R282W is the sixth most frequent p53 mutation and accounts for approximately 2.8% of all TP53 mutations. The R282W mutation results from arginine being substituted by a tryptophan at amino acid position 282 and is considered a structural mutation. This structural mutation is thermodynamically unstable and cause the protein to lose shape and therefore its wild-type DNA binding activity at physiological temperature. This results in a lack of p53 transcription and pathway activation.


We are generating molecules designed to structurally correct the R282W p53 protein to restore its binding to the DNA. Our R282W program continues to progress towards lead optimization.
 Other Pipeline Programs
 In addition to our PC14586 Y220C and R282W programs, we are focused on developing a pipeline of product candidates targeting other p53 hotspot mutations and targeting inhibitors of wild-type p53. These programs have been developed internally using our precision oncology platform and expertise.
 We are able to utilize the same general principles and similar drug discovery methods developed from our PC14586 Y220C program across other p53 hotspot mutations to facilitate the discovery of additional new product candidates. We study the structural and functional properties of the target. We use assays, screens, preclinical model systems and biomarkers to assess and optimize selective small molecules for specific p53 mutants. Specifically, many of the efficiencies from assays and model systems developed for our PC14586 Y220C program are being applied to other p53 hotspot mutations. In addition, the key insights gained from the medicinal chemistry campaigns are being leveraged across other p53 hotspot mutations. By leveraging our team’s depth of expertise around p53, we are positioned to accelerate our efforts to expand the pipeline of therapies that selectively target p53 hotspot mutations and other p53-related cancers.
 

Competition
 Our industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change, as well as strong defense of intellectual property. While we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face substantial competition from major pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources. Smaller and early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.
 We are a precision oncology company pioneering the discovery and development of small molecule therapies targeting p53 mutations and other p53-related cancers. We are aware of other product candidates that are in clinical development as potential treatments of various cancers through the modulation of p53. There are many product candidates that may affect the p53 pathway, such as through MDM2 inhibition. We are aware of molecules in development that also are being explored for p53 upregulation/activation in various stages of preclinical or clinical development being tested by Aprea Therapeutics and Jacobio Pharmaceuticals, among others. We are also aware of selective small molecule inhibitors that are designed to target wild-type p53 containing tumors through the p53-MDM2 interaction, which are in various stages of clinical development being tested by Aileron Therapeutics, Ascentage Pharma, Boehringer Ingelheim, Daiichi Sankyo (out-licensed worldwide rights to Rain Therapeutics), Kartos Therapeutics, Kymera Therapeutics, Otsuka Pharmaceutical, Novartis and Roche, including testing MDM2 inhibitors in combination with a variety of other anti-cancer agents.
 We face competition with respect to our current product candidates and will face competition with respect to future product candidates, from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue targeted therapies for patients with genetically-defined cancers. If PC14586 or our future product candidates do not offer sustainable advantages over competing products, we may otherwise not be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors.
 Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we may or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.
 In addition, we will likely need to develop our product candidates in collaboration with companion diagnostic companies, and we will face competition from other companies in establishing these collaborations. Our competitors will also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 Furthermore, we also face competition more broadly across the market for cost-effective and reimbursable cancer treatments. The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy or a combination of such methods. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drug and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. We expect that if our product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic, including branded generic, products. As a result, obtaining market acceptance of, and gaining significant share of the market for, any of our product candidates that we successfully introduce to the market will pose challenges. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development.
 

Manufacturing
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates undergoing preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval.
 All of our product candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in synthetic processes from available starting materials. The chemistry appears amenable to scale up and does not currently require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
 We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of companion diagnostics for our products, which are assays or tests to identify an appropriate patient population. Depending on the technology solutions we choose, we may rely on multiple third parties to manufacture and sell a single test.
 Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements which impose certain production, manufacturing, procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP requirements and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 Commercialization
 Subject to receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building a focused sales and marketing organization to sell our products. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the community of oncologists who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our product candidates are being developed.
 We also plan to build a marketing and sales management organization to create and implement marketing strategies for any products that we market through our own sales organization and to oversee and support our sales force. The responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved products and establishing relationships with researchers and practitioners in relevant fields of medicine.
 Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights. We also rely on know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates and continuing innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position. We also plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions and improvements; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including any patents that we may own in the future; and to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. Intellectual property rights may not address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.
 

With respect to our existing and future product candidates and processes we intend to develop and commercialize in the normal course of business, we intend to pursue further patent protection covering, when possible, compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations. We also may pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies. Obtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies. We may not be able to obtain patent protections for our compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations, manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies throughout the world. Issued patents can provide protection for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In general, patents issued for applications filed in the United States can provide exclusionary rights for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, the term of an issued U.S. patent that is directed to or claims an FDA-approved product can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. This process is called “patent term extension.” The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The term of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. Patent term may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of time.
 The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of biopharmaceuticals has emerged in the United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States are also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions and improvements. We cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. Patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have, or may obtain, blocking patents of which we are currently unaware that could be used to prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology. Further, defense of infringement claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees for willful infringement, pay royalties or redesign our products. Doing so may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We may also elect to enter into a license agreement to settle litigation or to resolve disputes prior to litigation. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates. Should a license to a third party patent become necessary, we cannot predict whether we would be able to obtain a license, or if a license were available, whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. If such a license is necessary and a license under the applicable patent is unavailable on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, our ability to commercialize our product candidates may be impaired or delayed. This scenario could materially adversely affect our business. Even if we obtain a license to third party intellectual property, we may later decide, or it may later become necessary, to terminate the license. If we do so, we may no longer be free to use the technology protected by the patents no longer under license. Also, if a competitor developed the technology protected by the patents no longer under license, we would not be able to block the competitor’s progress. If the competitor’s product was competitive with ours, then we may suffer economic harm from the competitive product.
 

The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope, validity or enforceability and our issued patents may be challenged, invalidated, deemed unenforceable or circumvented. These scenarios could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing-related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidates. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Moreover, any efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are likely to be costly and may divert the efforts of our scientific and management personnel. We may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. We may also be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.
 In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent directed to such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides.
 We generally file a provisional patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, first and then subsequently file a corresponding non-provisional patent application. This process enables us to establish an earlier effective filing date in the subsequently filed non-provisional patent application. To benefit from the earlier effective filing date, we must file a corresponding non-provisional patent application, such as a utility application in the United States or an international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, within 12 months of the date of the provisional patent application filing. Based on a PCT filing, we may file national and regional patent applications in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, such as the European Union, China, Japan and possibly others. To date, we have not filed for patent protection in all national and regional jurisdictions where such protection may be available, and we may decide to abandon national and regional patent applications before a patent is granted. In addition, the patent grant proceeding for each national or regional patent application that we file is an independent proceeding. As a result, it is possible for a patent application to be granted in one jurisdiction and denied in another jurisdiction, and depending on the jurisdiction, the scope of patent protection may vary. As of January 31, 2023, we owned three issued US patents and five granted foreign patents relating to methods of use and composition of matter of PMV compounds, including PC14586, at least 20 pending US patent applications, and at least 40 pending foreign patent applications, each of which relates to methods of use and composition of matter of PMV compounds. The three issued US patents are expected to expire in 2037, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustment or extensions.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data must be generated, which demonstrates the drug’s quality, safety and efficacy. Such data must then be organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Development Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 •completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with FDA’s good laboratory practice requirements and other applicable regulations;
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
 •submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials;
 •determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for substantive review;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCP requirements; and
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB or ethics committee for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 •Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
 •Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
 •Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
 In some cases, FDA may require, or sponsors may voluntarily pursue, post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, that are conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, such as with accelerated approval drugs, the FDA may mandate the performance of post-approval clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial.
 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 1 and Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 To the extent our clinical trial plans and future planned clinical trials may be adversely affected, delayed or interrupted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we may be required to develop and implement additional clinical trial policies and procedures designed to help protect subjects participating in clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, since March 2020, the FDA has issued various COVID-19 related guidance documents for trial sponsors and manufacturers, including guidance on conducting clinical trials during the pandemic, cGMP requirements, remote interactive evaluations of drug manufacturing and bioresearch monitoring facilities, and drug product manufacturing and supply chain inspections, among others. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. Recently, President Biden announced that the administration intends to end the COVID-19 national and public health emergencies on May 11, 2023. The full impact of the termination of the public health emergencies on FDA and other regulatory policies and operations are unclear.
 NDA Review and Approval Process
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing complies with cGMP requirements to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after the application is submitted. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA to address all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a REMS to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.
 In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
 

Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. For example, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life- threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The sponsor of a Fast Track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once a NDA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. With regard to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals.
 In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. On December 29, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, including the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (FDORA), was signed into law. FDORA made several changes to the FDA’s authorities and its regulatory framework, including, among other changes, reforms to the accelerated approval pathway, such as requiring the FDA to specify conditions for post-approval study requirements and setting forth procedures for the FDA to withdraw a product on an expedited basis for non-compliance with post-approval requirements.
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category of drugs referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be eligible to receive breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will work to expedite the development and review of such drug.
 Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.
 

Post-approval Requirements
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements, which impose certain production, manufacturing, procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning letters or untitled letters;
 •clinical holds on clinical studies;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 

The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labelling.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 Orphan Drugs
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation, or ODD, to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with either a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater of than 200,000 individuals in the United States when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States of that drug or biologic. ODD must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants ODD, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
 If a product that has received ODD and subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years from the approval of the NDA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of ODD are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received ODD. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.


In Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra, 14 F.4th 1299 (11th Cir. 2021), the court disagreed with the FDA’s longstanding position that the orphan drug exclusivity only applies to the approved use or indication within an eligible disease. This decision created uncertainty in the application of the orphan drug exclusivity. On January 24, 2023, the FDA published a notice in the Federal Register to clarify that while the agency complies with the court’s order in Catalyst, FDA intends to continue to apply its longstanding interpretation of the regulations to matters outside of the scope of the Catalystorder – that is, the agency will continue tying the scope of orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which a drug is approved, which permits other sponsors to obtain approval of a drug for new uses or indications within the same orphan designated disease or condition that have not yet been approved. It is unclear how future litigation, legislation, agency decisions, and administrative actions will impact the scope of the orphan drug exclusivity.
 Marketing Exclusivity
 Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission and approval of certain marketing applications for products containing the same active ingredient. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
 The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from accepting ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs referencing the approved application for review. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances.
 

Other Healthcare Laws
 Pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to additional healthcare fraud and abuse laws, regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal anti-kickback, false claims, civil monetary penalty, consumer fraud, pricing reporting, data privacy and security and physician payment transparency laws and regulations as well as similar foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. Similar state and local laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information; state and local laws which require tracking gifts and other remuneration and transfer of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and local laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 The risk of being found in violation of these or other laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts and their provisions are open to various interpretations. These laws and regulations are subject to change, which can increase the resources needed for compliance and delay drug approval or commercialization. Any action brought against us for violations of these laws or regulations, even successfully defended, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Also, we may be subject to private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers on behalf of the federal or state governments. Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in penalties, including, without limitation, significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and imprisonment.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. As a result, the coverage determination process can require manufacturers to provide scientific, cost-effectiveness and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately and can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. In addition, companion diagnostic tests that are used with applicable pharmaceutical products require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical products, will apply to companion diagnostics.
 

Moreover, third-party payors are increasingly reducing coverage and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products and related services. The U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability for manufacturers to sell products profitably. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
 In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of example, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, on June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.
 

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, effective April 1, 2013, which will remain in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments can vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester.
 Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs will be eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than it receives on the sale of approved products, which could have a material impact on our business. In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes prescription drug provisions that have significant implications for the pharmaceutical industry and Medicare beneficiaries, including allowing the federal government to negotiate a maximum fair price for certain high-priced single source Medicare drugs, imposing penalties and excise tax for manufacturers that fail to comply with the drug price negotiation requirements, requiring inflation rebates for all Medicare Part B and Part D drugs, with limited exceptions, if their drug prices increase faster than inflation, and redesigning Medicare Part D to reduce out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for beneficiaries, among other changes. The impact of these and future reform measures on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear.
 At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs.
 FDA Approval and Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 We expect that our product candidates may require use of a diagnostic to identify appropriate patient populations for our products. These diagnostics, often referred to as companion diagnostics, are medical devices, often in vitro devices, which provide information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding drug. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval. We expect that any companion diagnostic developed for our product candidates will utilize the PMA pathway.
 

The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, a PMA application typically requires data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
 PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards are not maintained, or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, if FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication at the same time. The review of in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our therapeutic treatments for cancer will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of In Vitro Diagnostics. The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE. After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
