Item 1. Business. 
OVERVIEW 
 We are a pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products that have the potential to transform the way therapy is delivered, advance patient care and reduce healthcare costs. Our proprietary platform is designed to enable the subcutaneous administration of therapies that have previously been limited to intravenous, or IV, delivery. By moving delivery away from the high-cost healthcare settings typically required for IV administration, we believe our technology has the potential to reduce overall healthcare costs and advance the quality and convenience of care. Our lead product candidate, FUROSCIX, consists of our novel, buffered formulation of furosemide delivered subcutaneously via an on-body infusor and is under development for treatment of congestion in patients with worsening heart failure who display reduced responsiveness to oral diuretics and do not require hospitalization. 
 We filed a new drug application, or NDA, for FUROSCIX incorporating the sc2Wear Infusor developed in partnership with Sensile Medical AG, or Sensile, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in August 2017. The FDA notified us in October 2017 that it had accepted our NDA for review. On June 11, 2018 we received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA, which indicated that, among other things, certain device modifications to the sc2Wear Infusor were required.  We conducted a post-action meeting with the FDA on September 24, 2018 and a Type C meeting with the FDA on January 9, 2019.  Based on the outcome of our interactions with the FDA, including clarification on an additional dose validation study and proposed device modifications necessary to advance FUROSCIX using the existing delivery technology, we have decided to discontinue use of the sc2Wear Infusor and transition to our next generation device being developed in partnership with West Pharmaceuticals Services, Inc., or West, using its proprietary, wearable, SmartDose® drug delivery system (SmartDose is a registered trademark of West Pharma. Services IL, Ltd., a subsidiary of West, in the United States and other jurisdictions). Our future regulatory filings will be based on delivery of scFurosemide using this next generation SmartDose drug delivery system. In addition, future clinical trials that we sponsor or conduct will use the SmartDose drug delivery platform.
 
Heart failure affects 6.5 million adults in the United States and is expected to grow to greater than 8 million by 2030. Our proprietary formulation of furosemide, or scFurosemide, administered subcutaneously via the next generation SmartDose drug delivery system, which we refer to together as FUROSCIX, is intended to help alleviate the signs and symptoms associated with congestion in heart failure patients, such as congestion, fatigue and shortness of breath.  FUROSCIX is designed to offer alternative outpatient intervention in heart failure patients who display reduced responsiveness to oral diuretics in non-emergency situations and do not require hospitalization.  
 We believe FUROSCIX, if approved by the FDA, would allow heart failure patients to receive IV-strength diuresis potentially without admission to the high-cost hospital setting. Prevention of hospital admission and reduced readmission rates would result in reducing the estimated 15 million days patients with heart failure spend in the hospital each year. By decreasing the number of admissions and readmissions to hospitals, we believe we can drive significant cost savings to payers and hospitals. 
 Currently, Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy, or OPAT, requires the placement of a long-term venous access device, known as a peripherally inserted central catheter, or PICC, and coordination of home infusion or office-based infusion services for patients to receive antibiotics outside of the hospital.  We are also leveraging our subcutaneous formulation expertise to develop a suite of additional product candidates that we believe can significantly decrease the cost of treatment by moving treatment away from the hospital setting and can improve patient quality of life by eliminating the need for IV catheters. We have conducted additional development work to deliver ceftriaxone, a parenteral cephalosporin that is typically administered intravenously or intramuscularly. Based on IMS Health data, each year there are 15 million outpatient days in the United States of ceftriaxone therapy to treat various types of infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and Lyme Disease. Subcutaneous administration of ceftriaxone represents an opportunity to reduce costs to the overall health care system and improve the quality of care by reducing the complications and serious health risks associated with IV catheters and increasing patient mobility and convenience. We have conducted a pharmacokinetic study with subcutaneous ceftriaxone and intend to conduct additional clinical trials to advance its development, including a planned study in 2020 to evaluate skin safety after subcutaneous administration. We expect to submit an NDA for subcutaneous ceftriaxone in 2021.

Beyond furosemide and ceftriaxone, we aim to leverage our subcutaneous formulation expertise to develop and seek approval of additional drug candidates. We intend to conduct feasibility work on additional antibiotics and evaluate other product candidates. 
 OUR PLATFORM AND OTHER PIPELINE PROGRAMS 
 
FUROSCIX to Treat Decompensated Heart Failure
 Heart failure is a chronic disease resulting from impairment of the heart’s ability to pump blood and can be caused by a number of factors, including congenital conditions, history of heart attack, arrhythmias and complications of other chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. Patients with heart failure are prone to retain water and salt, or fluid, in their blood stream and other tissues. As fluid accumulates, heart pumping efficiency begins to diminish, and congestion ensues. Congestion can lead to extra fluid in the lungs, ankles and abdomen causing symptoms ranging from weight gain, mild swelling and shortness of breath while walking to more severe symptoms, such as weakness, severe fatigue, and difficulty breathing when sitting or lying down.  Congestion is the most common symptom experienced in patients with heart failure and is a common trigger for heart failure patients to seek medical attention.  This state of worsening of heart failure symptoms due to excessive fluid retention, or congestion, is referred to as decompensated heart failure. 
 Oral diuretics, in particular loop diuretics, are the mainstay for the management and prevention of congestion in patients with heart failure.  Diuretics, such as furosemide, work by promoting the removal of excess salt and water via the kidneys.  However, during periods of decompensation or worsening heart failure due to congestion, the absorption of oral furosemide decreases and the oral diuretics become less effective.  Since symptoms of congestion generally worsen over several days or weeks, there is a window of opportunity to intervene.  In the face of decreased absorption and efficacy of oral furosemide and worsening symptoms, doses of oral diuretics are typically increased or synergistic diuretics are added in an attempt to overcome the reduced absorption and to facilitate diuresis.  When this fails, clinicians have to rely on hospitalization for the administration of IV diuretics to relieve the symptoms of congestion, or decongestion.
 Even when following a regular oral loop diuretic regimen, patients with heart failure regularly experience episodes of decompensated heart failure. These episodes can be triggered by various physiological factors, some as simple as salty meals or a patient missing or skipping doses of oral furosemide. Patients and physicians aim to prevent these episodes by monitoring for early signs of congestion, such as swelling ankles, weight gain, breathing difficulty or decreased urination. At the onset of a decompensated heart failure event, physicians commonly increase the dose of the patient’s oral diuretic or add another oral diuretic in an effort to eliminate excess fluid.   If this dosing strategy fails and the progressive accumulation of fluid overwhelms the failing heart, the patient is eventually admitted to the hospital for treatment of the decompensated heart failure with IV diuretics.  
 Congestion due to sodium retention leading to decompensation is the primary cause for patient admission to the acute care setting among adult patients with heart failure. An analysis of 585 heart failure admissions published in the American Journal of Critical Care found that 59% of admissions are attributed to excessive sodium retention leading to volume overload. Patients suffering from an acute-decompensation event can develop worsening symptoms rapidly and a multiday hospital admission for a more aggressive and predictable diuretic treatment regimen with IV furosemide is required. 
 FUROSCIX is our novel formulation of furosemide contained in a pre-filled, Crystal Zenith® cartridge and administered subcutaneously via a single-use, disposable and wearable infusor with an automatic needle insertion and retraction mechanism for self-administration.  The user inserts the pre-filled cartridge in the wearable device, applies it to the abdomen using a medical-grade adhesive, and the device administers scFurosemide subcutaneously using a biphasic delivery profile with 30 mg administered over the first hour, followed by 12.5 mg/hour for the subsequent 4 hours (total dose is 80 mg furosemide over 5 hours).
We believe that, if approved, FUROSCIX has the potential to provide a safe and effective solution that will enable IV-strength diuresis outside of the high-cost hospital setting, thereby reducing the number of days a heart failure patient remains in the hospital. We believe we can reduce the estimated 15 million days per year that heart failure patients spend in the hospital and thus reduce overall health care costs by decreasing both admissions and readmissions.

Subcutaneous delivery has the potential to: 
  
• | Reduce hospital admission rates: We believe the use of FUROSCIX, if approved, could in certain instances avoid a hospitalization altogether, by providing IV-strength diuresis in an outpatient setting such as the physician’s office, heart failure clinic or at home. Since symptoms of congestion generally worsen over several days or weeks, there is a window of opportunity to intervene. It is estimated that 90% of patients presenting to the Emergency Department with decompensated heart failure are admitted to the hospital and approximately 50% of those patients could be safely discharged after a brief period of observation. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduce patient readmission: We believe FUROSCIX, if approved, could reduce the incidence of readmission for heart failure patients by continuing IV-strength diuresis in the home environment upon discharge. It is estimated that 30-50% of patients that are hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure that are transitioned to oral furosemide prior to being discharged from the hospital have persistent symptoms of congestion at discharge. Persistent congestion may reduce the absorption of oral furosemide reducing the diuretic effect. As a result, patients are often readmitted to the hospital to receive IV furosemide. We believe FUROSCIX can break this cycle by providing IV-strength diuresis to patients upon discharge, or shortly after discharge to reduce the rate of readmissions for decompensated heart failure. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 FUROSCIX is designed to offer an outpatient intervention to deliver IV-strength furosemide.  We believe this approach can improve patients’ quality of life by providing treatment with minimal interruption of daily living. The wearable design of the SmartDose drug delivery system to administer scFurosemide could potentially promote patient mobility by delivering the required dose while the patient resumes their normal daily activities outside of the hospital. Evidence also supports that in-home care for patients with heart failure may prolong life expectancy and improve quality of life by facilitating access to the patient’s care support system. Based on our market research, we believe that patients and physicians would embrace FUROSCIX, if approved, if it improves patient outcomes and quality of life. 
 Clinical Development of FUROSCIX 
 Our Subcutaneous Formulation of Furosemide 
 To date, 127 subjects with heart failure have received scFurosemide via subcutaneous administration in our clinical studies, where 101 subjects received scFurosemide via our previous delivery device, the sc2Wear Infusor, and 26 subjects received scFurosemide delivered via the B. Braun Perfusor Space Infusion Pump, or B. Braun Pump, a large, three-pound commercial pump used in operating rooms and emergency care settings. Based on the overall observations and outcomes of these studies, we believe that FUROSCIX has the potential to be used to treat congestion, with comparable pharmacokinetics, diuresis and natriuresis to IV furosemide, when administered by patients and their care givers outside the hospital, in clinical and home environments. To date, no clinical studies have been conducted using the next generation SmartDose drug delivery system. 
 We held a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA on June 1, 2017, and in August 2017 we submitted an NDA for our lead product candidate, FUROSCIX incorporating the sc2Wear Infusor. The FDA notified us in October 2017 that it had accepted our NDA for review and assigned us a June 23, 2018 Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, date. On June 11, 2018 we received a CRL from the FDA, which indicated that, among other things, certain device modifications to the sc2Wear Infusor were required.  We conducted a post-action meeting with the FDA on September 24, 2018 and a Type C meeting with the FDA on January 9, 2019.  Based on the outcome of our interactions with the FDA, including clarification on an additional dose validation study and proposed device modifications necessary to advance FUROSCIX using the existing delivery technology, we have decided to discontinue use of the sc2Wear Infusor developed in partnership with Sensile, and transition to our next generation infusor being developed in partnership with West with their proprietary, wearable, SmartDose subcutaneous drug delivery system.  We plan to resubmit an NDA for FUROSCIX, incorporating the next generation SmartDose drug delivery system, and we also plan to support our application for marketing approval with existing data from our clinical studies evaluating our subcutaneous formulation of furosemide administered via the sc2Wear Infusor and the B. Braun Pump.

Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) Study 
 We conducted a pivotal, randomized, open-label crossover study from April to September 2015 to assess the relative bioavailability of our novel formulation of furosemide and IV furosemide in 17 patients with heart failure who were experiencing decompensation. In this study, our subcutaneous formulation of furosemide was delivered via the B. Braun Pump. This study also evaluated diuresis and the excretion of sodium over eight hours and 24 hours post-dosing as the pharmacodynamic endpoints. 
 Treatment arms 
 In this study, our reference treatment was IV furosemide with two bolus injections of 40 mg dosed over two minutes, two hours apart. Our test treatment was subcutaneous administration of our novel furosemide formulation with 80 mg infused subcutaneously, with 30 mg over the first hour followed by 12.5 mg per hour over the subsequent four hours. 
 Comparative pharmacokinetic results 
 This study demonstrated bioequivalence in the concentration of drug delivered over time based upon the area under the curve, or AUC, between our subcutaneous formulation of furosemide and IV furosemide. Although the maximum concentration, or Cmax, of furosemide achieved was four-fold higher with IV injection compared to subcutaneous infusion, the bioavailability of subcutaneous infusion relative to intravenous injection was 99.6%, with a 90% confidence interval of 94.8% to 104.8%, thus meeting the FDA’s defined bioequivalence criteria limit of 80% to 125%. We believe that the difference in Cmax between IV injection and subcutaneous furosemide is attributable to the two bolus IV injections administered at the initiation of IV therapy. Nevertheless, the longer period of administration for our subcutaneous formulation resulted in similar bioavailability profiles of the two routes of administration over time. 
 
Comparative pharmacodynamic results 
 The total urine sodium excretion and urine output were comparable between our subcutaneous formulation of furosemide and IV furosemide. 
 Phase 3 Product Design Clinical Validation (PDCV) Study 
 In October 2016, we conducted a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, single-dose study as a clinical validation of the use of FUROSCIX with the sc2Wear Infusor in 74 adult heart failure patients at five clinical sites in the United States. Six of these patients were ultimately excluded from the study due to activator interruptions, and one patient was excluded due to truncated infusion, resulting in a modified intention to treat, or MITT, population of 67 patients that completed the five-hour infusion period. 
 In this study, our novel formulation of furosemide was subcutaneously administered using the sc2Wear Infusor with a preset dosage of 30 mg furosemide over the first hour, then 12.5 mg per hour for the subsequent four hours. 
 Primary Endpoints 
 The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the on-body performance of FUROSCIX, defined as the absence of major product and major system related failures leading to inadequate delivery of drug product (performance criteria of 95% passage rate with 95% confidence) in the MITT population. 
 In the MITT population, 63 of 67 (94%) FUROSCIX infusions were free from major system-related failure, with a 95% confidence interval of 85% to 98%. As such, this study did not meet the FDA’s prespecified performance criteria. All patients in the MITT population, however, achieved furosemide concentrations above the pre-defined target therapeutic threshold. In the four cases in which FUROSCIX administered dose fell below the predefined criteria of 80 mg (10 mL) ± 10%, only one was determined to be due to a dispensing failure, which resulted in the delivery of 67 mg of furosemide instead of the 72 mg minimum dose specification. The three other dispensing failures were determined to be caused by an undetected, incomplete filling of the sc2Wear Infusor, likely due to user errors, as the three incomplete fillings observed in these devices were not able to be reproduced during bench testing. When the sc2Wear Infusor was filled adequately, 63 of 64 (98%) FUROSCIX infusions were within the prespecified performance criteria, with a 95% confidence interval of 92% to 100%. 
 5

We discussed these data with the FDA at a pre-NDA meeting, held on June 1, 2017, and presented the results of a completed human factors study in which the frequency of undetected fill errors was 0%, as a result of our improvements to the quick reference guide and instructions for use. As part of our NDA submission, the FDA requested that a high-level safety assurance case be submitted just prior to the NDA submission and that certain updated risk analyses be submitted concurrently with our NDA. Although the PDCV study did not meet the prespecified endpoint, during the meeting, the FDA requested that our NDA include an assessment of the data generated from all of our studies. In connection with the NDA that we submitted to the FDA in August 2017, we submitted the materials that we believe are responsive to the requests that the FDA made at our pre-NDA meeting. We reported to the FDA that we believe FUROSCIX will be used as designed by patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals in the clinic and in the home, even by first-time users, as supported by our observations that risk control measures such as our training videos, customer help line, and warning labels were sufficient in reducing the possibility of user errors to an acceptable level. In addition, we represented in our submission that the FDA may deem overall residual risks acceptable because i) furosemide is generally considered safe and effective due to its long history of use in the U.S., ii) FUROSCIX will not be indicated for emergency situations, iii) any under-dosing or error in treatment would be readily detectable due to the noticeable pharmacological response of furosemide, and iv) the sources of residual risk in administering FUROSCIX are limited to non-critical tasks that we believe do not pose a serious health hazard to users or the patient. We also submitted a safety assurance case that the design of FUROSCIX may be deemed safe for its intended use based on our belief that FUROSCIX is adequately defined, its design is adequately verified and validated, the risks associated with FUROSCIX and its system hazards have been identified and mitigated, and FUROSCIX is adequately reliable to ensure safety over its use life. 
 Secondary Analysis 
 The study also included secondary tolerability endpoints, including a comfort of wear questionnaire that was completed one hour after completion of FUROSCIX infusion. The graph below reflects the overall comfort reported by the patients in the MITT population:

In addition, administration of FUROSCIX was found to have only minimal impact on participants’ daily living activities, which included walking, standing, sitting, lying down/napping, using the bathroom, or driving/riding in a car. Between 86% and 94% of participants who answered the questionnaire reported that FUROSCIX did not interfere with the activities reflected in the graph below: 
 

Safety Analysis 
 We observed no needle insertion failures, dislodgements or leaks. The most frequently observed adverse events were local skin effects, such as reddening, or erythema, bruising and pain, which were mild or moderate in severity. No patients reported infections at the infusion site. One serious adverse event was observed and determined by the investigator not to be related to FUROSCIX. The event was a single episode of ventricular tachycardia, or quickening of the patient’s heart rate, that occurred five days after completion of the study. The event occurred in a patient with a history of prior episodes of ventricular tachycardia. 
 Post-Hoc Comparative Analysis to Bridge the Pharmacokinetics from the PK/PD Study and Plasma Concentrations from the PDCV Study 
 The B. Braun Pump was used for subcutaneous administration of our subcutaneous formulation of furosemide in the PK/PD study and the sc2Wear Infusor was used to administer our subcutaneous formulation of furosemide in the PDCV study. Based on a pharmacokinetic bridging analysis conducted between the PK/PD and PDCV studies, comparable furosemide systemic exposures and subsequently comparable diuresis would be expected to be achieved when our subcutaneous furosemide formulation is administered via the sc2Wear Infusor compared to the B. Braun Pump. 
 7

The same 80 mg dose and dosing regimen of 30 mg dosed over the first hour followed by 12.5 mg/hour for the subsequent four hours, was used in both studies. Mean furosemide concentrations and the representative 95% confidence intervals obtained during the five-hour infusion from the two studies are represented in the figure below: 
 

Overall, between the first and fifth hours, the plasma furosemide concentrations were higher and more variable in the PDCV study compared to the PK/PD study, partly due to the unmatched timepoints. However, between the second and fifth hours the furosemide concentrations were similar between the two studies. The higher concentrations observed in the PDCV study were lower than the Cmax observed in the IV doses in the PK/PD study, which we believe is relevant to regulatory safety assessments of FUROSCIX. 
 We plan to discuss with the FDA whether any additional clinical or bridging studies may be required to support approval of FUROSCIX incorporating the SmartDose drug delivery system. 
 Human Factors Summary 
 There were approximately 230 patients, caregivers and health care providers that participated in formative and summative usability testing from Fall 2015 to Fall 2018 using the sc2Wear Infusor, respectively. 
 West has conducted numerous formative and summative human factors with the SmartDose drug delivery system.  We anticipate conducting additional formative and summative studies with the SmartDose drug delivery system in our intended user population. 
Investigator Sponsored Study 
 In February 2016, an open label, randomized study of 40 patients was initiated to evaluate urine output and adverse events of our subcutaneous formulation of furosemide administered subcutaneously via B. Braun Pump compared to IV furosemide in patients with decompensated heart failure presenting to the John’s Hopkins Heart Failure Bridge Clinic. In this study, subjects randomized to receive our subcutaneous formulation of furosemide were administered a single, 80 mg dose subcutaneously over five hours and patients randomized to IV furosemide received a single dose intravenously equivalent to their oral maintenance dose up to a maximum dose of 160 mg. The mean dose of IV furosemide that was administered was 123+47 mg and 58% received the maximum 160 mg dose. The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate urine output after six hours. From the results of this study, the investigator concluded that treatment with our subcutaneous formulation of furosemide resulted in equivalent diuresis and weight loss and was well tolerated compared to IV furosemide in patients with decompensated heart failure presenting to an outpatient heart failure clinic. There was one adverse event, an episode of hypokalemia, which is a drop in a subject’s potassium levels, observed in a subject who received our subcutaneous formulation of furosemide. In this subject, the serum potassium level at baseline was 4.1 milliequivalents per liter, or mEq/L and dropped to 3.3 mEq/L after subcutaneous infusion of furosemide, which is slightly below the normal range of 3.5 mEq/L to 5.0 mEq/L. There were no serious adverse events reported.

We intend to support additional investigator sponsored studies post approval and initiate Phase 4 studies with FUROSCIX, incorporating the SmartDose drug delivery system, to evaluate the efficacy, safety, patient acceptance and health economic outcomes. 
 Commercialization 
 If we successfully obtain regulatory approval, we plan to commercialize FUROSCIX in the United States by building and utilizing our own commercial infrastructure. We currently intend to focus our commercial efforts on the United States market, which we believe represents the largest market opportunity for FUROSCIX. In addition, we plan to establish collaborations with third-party intermediaries outside of the United States to distribute our products in foreign markets, if approved by the relevant foreign regulatory authorities. 
 We believe that we can effectively commercialize FUROSCIX, if approved, in the United States with an initial specialty sales force of approximately 35-40 representatives. We intend to initially pursue a highly-concentrated target market, which consists of 350 hospitals and associated clinics that, collectively, account for 40% of all IV furosemide administered to heart failure patients based on current IMS Drug Distribution Data. We also plan to target the top ten Medicare Part D plans, which cover 80% of Medicare Part D patients. We conducted payer research on 14 payers, representing 22 to 29 million total Medicare lives. We found that reducing readmissions, increasing patient comfort were ranked as important potential attributes of FUROSCIX by the health plans and pharmacy benefit managers that were surveyed. 
 We intend to build a highly concentrated commercial infrastructure focused on distribution, promotion and customer support to physicians and specialists in our key hospital targets. Our target call points within these hospitals will include heart failure specialists, cardiologists, hospitalists, emergency room doctors and heart failure nurse practitioners. To date, our market research with 309 healthcare professionals has indicated that 93% of our target prescribers would adopt FUROSCIX, if approved, with 80% intending to adopt FUROSCIX in the first six months of product availability. Furthermore, within the prescriber group of heart failure specialists, cardiologists and nurse practitioners that we intend to target at launch, the intent to adopt is 93%, 96% and 94%, respectively, and 89%, 88% and 86%, respectively, of those prescribers intend to adopt in the first six months of product availability. Based on our market research, healthcare professionals perceive the top potential advantages of FUROSCIX, if approved, as the ability to treat in the home setting, prevention of hospitalization, and avoidance of IV placement, while the lowest perceived barriers to adoption identified in the survey were the preference to monitor in a hospital setting, current medications are sufficient and hospital guidelines or protocols. In addition, based on a last two patient exercise conducted in our quantitative market research with healthcare professionals, when given the option to change their prior treatment choice to FUROSCIX, if approved, 65% of healthcare practitioners in a clinic setting and 40% in a hospital setting would have prescribed our product candidate. We expect to supplement our sales force with representatives in the medical science, nursing, and reimbursement field personnel to support the proper training and utilization of FUROSCIX. 
 As part of our commercialization strategy, we plan to educate hospitals, healthcare practitioners, patients and caregivers of the benefits of FUROSCIX and its proper use. We plan to work with national associations, such as the American Heart Association, hospital networks, and individual hospitals to update treatment and discharge guidelines to include subcutaneous furosemide in treatment plans. These guidelines are intended to provide information to hospitals and healthcare practitioners regarding treatment of heart failure patients with subcutaneous furosemide. 
 We expect to package FUROSCIX, if approved, as individual on-body infusor packs, reimbursed through Medicare Part D. Hospital outpatient departments, clinics, and physician’s offices would be able to train and initially place FUROSCIX for the patient and may be eligible for reimbursement for these training services under Medicare Part B, so long as certain criteria are met. Inpatients transitioning out of the hospital who require additional days of treatment may obtain FUROSCIX on-body infusor packs outside of the acute care setting. In April 2016, we held a meeting with CMS, at which CMS stated that coverage and reimbursement of FUROSCIX may be available under Medicare Part D as a transition of care drug. By educating patients on the proper use of FUROSCIX shortly after discharge followed by a face-to-face visit, health care professionals can ensure proper training, initiate treatment at the point of care, and ensure that patients can receive additional days of treatment in the home setting.

Our Pipeline Programs 
 Beyond our initial focus on heart failure, our strategy is to identify and develop additional product candidates where, if approved, effective and convenient subcutaneous therapy may benefit patients, caregivers and payers. 

• | scFurosemide: Our lead product candidate, FUROSCIX, consists of our proprietary subcutaneous formulation of furosemide, previously delivered via the sc2Wear Infusor and now delivered via the SmartDose drug delivery system, for treatment of congestion in decompensated heart failure patients outside of the acute care setting. We have completed a pivotal pharmacokinetic study, a clinical design validation study, and 12 human factor studies for FUROSCIX incorporating our first generation sc2Wear Infusor. Our future regulatory filings will be based on delivery of scFurosemide using the SmartDose drug delivery system. In addition, future clinical trials that we sponsor or conduct will be conducted using the SmartDose drug delivery system.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | scCeftriaxone: We have filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, for scCeftriaxone, an antibiotic currently used intravenously for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. To date, we have completed a PK study for scCeftriaxone and plan to conduct a skin safety study in 2020 to support an expected NDA filing in 2021.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | scCarbapenem: We have completed several IND-enabling studies for our scCarbapenem program, an antibiotic currently used intravenously for the treatment of infections caused by gram-negative organisms.

Ceftriaxone 
 Many patients with an infection requiring IV antibiotics are admitted to the hospital, and a portion of these patients will require subsequent outpatient treatment with IV administration requiring insertion of a PICC line catheter. Ceftriaxone is a parenteral antibiotic commonly used to treat various types of infections, including pneumonia, bone and joint infections, blood stream infections, urinary tract infections and Lyme Disease. According to 2015 data from Arlington Medical Resources, ceftriaxone is the second most utilized antibiotic in the hospital setting and second most utilized IV antibiotic at hospital discharge. Based on Option Care data from August 2016, ceftriaxone represents the largest segment of antibiotics prescribed in the outpatient setting, accounting for 19% of all outpatient prescriptions. Each year, there are approximately 15 million outpatient days of ceftriaxone therapy in the United States based on IMS Health data, with 50% of outpatient ceftriaxone administered to Medicare patients who do not have coverage for home infusion services and frequently must drive to a hospital clinic, emergency room or physician’s office or be admitted to a skilled nursing facility or hospital to receive IV antibiotics. Subcutaneous antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, have the potential to reduce the length of hospital stay by facilitating transition of care and eliminate the risks of complications from long term IV catheters. They also would provide a level of convenience and independence to patients and caregivers with a potential reduction in the economic burden to payers, particularly in Medicare, by reducing payments for outpatient infusion services. 
 After the submission of the IND we conducted a randomized, partially blinded crossover study of 18 patients to evaluate the PK and bioavailability of a commercial formulation of ceftriaxone administered subcutaneously as compared to IV administration. In this study, we observed that the bioavailability of subcutaneous ceftriaxone was 108% of that of IV ceftriaxone. In a PD model based on subcutaneous pharmacokinetics observed in this study, the T>MIC for the first 24 hours for the ceftriaxone 1-gram subcutaneous infusion was observed to be not inferior to the 1-gram IV infusion (98.5% vs 100%). The most common adverse event observed with subcutaneous ceftriaxone administration was pain with a median pain score of two on a scale of zero to ten (with zero being no pain and ten being the worst possible pain). There were no serious adverse events reported in this study. 
 We intend to conduct additional studies to evaluate optimal delivery for ceftriaxone and to evaluate the skin safety of ceftriaxone administered subcutaneously. If results from our clinical program for subcutaneous ceftriaxone are positive, we expect to be in a position to submit an NDA for this drug-device combination product candidate in 2021.

Additional Product Programs 
 We are leveraging our know-how for use in other clinical settings where subcutaneous delivery can improve IV treatments to develop a suite of product candidates that, like FUROSCIX and ceftriaxone, we believe can decrease the cost of treatment by moving treatment out of the hospital setting and eliminating the need for IV catheters. We expect to pursue the development of a subcutaneous carbapenem to treat infections caused by gram-negative infections and have completed initial feasibility work on a potential candidate. We also intend to identify other opportunities where subcutaneous delivery can improve patient treatment and reduce healthcare costs. We intend to evaluate market criteria to systematically choose potential product programs for our pipeline. We plan to look for product candidates that we believe allow us to clearly demonstrate value to patients and the healthcare system and that have large market potential and a concentrated specialty physician prescribing base. We expect to leverage our FUROSCIX sales force to promote additional products that we develop and commercialize. 
Our FUROSCIX Infusor 
 Beginning in February 2019, our lead product candidate, FUROSCIX, incorporates the next generation SmartDose drug delivery system developed in partnership with West.  Prior to that time, FUROSCIX incorporated the sc2Wear Infusor, developed in partnership with Sensile. 
 The next generation FUROSCIX infusor is completely disposable and incorporates a pre-filled cartridge filled with the FUROSCIX drug product.  The pre-filled cartridge creates an easy-to-use system that does not require patient filling.  The system also incorporates the safety features expected by regulatory agencies and incorporates updates to West’s first-generation device.
 The FUROSCIX cartridge is placed in the delivery system and then applied to the patient’s abdomen. With the push of a button, the device is activated and an electromechanical drive pushes the medication through a fluid path and delivers the drug formulation into the patient’s subcutaneous tissue. Our subcutaneous delivery system can be worn while patients perform typical daily life activities during that time, which we believe allows patients to receive treatment with minimal interference with their daily routine. 
 
MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES 
 We use a network of qualified suppliers or contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce, manufacture, sterilize and assemble the component parts of our product candidates, including FUROSCIX. Our suppliers produce these component parts to our designs and specifications. Certain processes utilized in the manufacture and test of our product candidates have been verified and validated as required by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. The manufacturing facilities of our suppliers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and certain corresponding state agencies, and we regularly audit our suppliers’ processes to ensure conformity with the specifications, policies and procedures for our product candidates. 
 We have produced FUROSCIX for use in our clinical trials and stability studies only. Following our transition to the second generation delivery device, scFurosemide will be packaged in a proprietary cartridge from West.  We believe that our current third-party manufacturers, including West, have capacity for potential commercialization of FUROSCIX, if approved, in quantities sufficient to meet our expected commercial needs, and to accommodate the manufacturing of materials for future clinical trials of other potential product programs that we may identify for our product pipeline. 
 In order to meet projected global demand for FUROSCIX, if approved, we plan to support an increase in production capacity at West’s facilities.
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 Proprietary protection 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates, manufacturing and process discoveries and other know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. We and our partners have been building and continue to build our intellectual property portfolio relating to our product candidates and technology. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are 
 11

important to the development and implementation of our business. We also intend to rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us or our partners in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. 
 Patent rights 
 Patent life determination depends on the date of filing of the application and other factors as promulgated under the patent laws. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. 
 scFurosemide formulation 
 As of March 14, 2019, we own a patent family directed to the composition of matter of our subcutaneous formulation of furosemide and methods of treating congestion, hypertension and heart failure using the formulation of furosemide. This patent family includes U.S. Patent No. 9,884,039, directed to methods of treatment, one pending U.S. patent application directed to liquid pharmaceutical formulations, one pending U.S. patent application directed to methods of treatment and pharmaceutical formulations, one granted patent in Japan, one pending patent application in each of Canada, China, Europe and Japan, and one granted patent and eight pending patent applications in other countries outside of the United States. Patents that issue from this patent family are generally expected to expire in 2034, excluding any additional term in the United States for patent term adjustment. U.S. Patent No. 9,884,039 is scheduled to expire in April 2034.
 Other furosemide formulations
 As of March 14, 2019, we also own a U.S. provisional patent application directed to compositions of matter of liquid pharmaceutical formulations containing an increased concentration of furosemide and methods of treating congestion, fluid overload, or hypertension using these formulations of furosemide.  A provisional patent application is not eligible to become an issued patent until, among other things, we file a non‑provisional patent application within 12 months of filing of the provisional patent application. If we continue to pursue patent protection and file a non‑provisional patent application with respect to our provisional patent application, and if any patents issue based on the non-provisional application, we expect such patents, if issued, to expire in 2040.
 Trade secret and other protection 
 In addition to patented intellectual property, we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect our technology and maintain our competitive position, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. Our policy is to require each of our employees, consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality and inventions assignment agreement before beginning their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us. The agreements generally provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us except in limited circumstances. These agreements generally also provide that we shall own all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us. 
 Other intellectual property rights 
 We file trademark applications and pursue registrations in the United States and abroad when appropriate. We own U.S. Registration No. 4851675 for the mark SCPHARMACEUTICALS for pharmaceutical preparations and substances for the treatment of cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary diseases and disorders and we own U.S. Registration No. 5287573 for the mark FUROSCIX for diuretics and pharmaceutical preparations for the treatment of edema, congestive heart failures, cirrhosis, and renal disease. We also own pending trademark applications and trade names for scPharmaceuticals and FUROSCIX in the United States and the EU for use in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development and potential products. 
 From time to time, we may find it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses from third-party intellectual property holders. 
 12

Sensile License Agreement 
 In June 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Sensile Medical AG and its former affiliates, Sensile Holding AG and Sensile Patent AG, which we refer to collectively as Sensile, through which we had been granted certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Sensile, to develop, commercialize and sell a drug-device combination product for subcutaneous administration in a defined field, which included generic loop diuretics, certain generic therapies for cardiovascular indications, and certain generic infectious disease therapies, including antibiotics. Sensile also granted us an exclusive worldwide manufacturing license to permit us, or an alternative supplier, to make the drug-device combination product described above, which we outsourced to third-party manufacturers.  On January 29, 2019, we issued to Sensile a notice of termination for business reasons under the license agreement. The termination will become effective as of March 30, 2019.COMPETITION 
 Our industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face competition and potential competition from a number of sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, generic drug companies, drug delivery companies and academic and research institutions. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates include ease of administration and convenience of dosing, therapeutic efficacy, safety and tolerability profiles and cost. Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, as well as more experience in the development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products, and the commercialization of those products. Consequently, our competitors may develop similar products for the treatment of heart failure or for other indications we may pursue in the future, and such competitors’ products may be more effective, better tolerated and less costly than our product candidates. Our competitors may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products than we are. We will also face competition in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment in clinical trials. 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 United States Drug Development 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs, medical devices and combinations of drugs and devices, or combination products, under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, requests for voluntary product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 13

Our product candidates are subject to regulation as combination products, which means that they are composed of both a drug product and device product. If marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and reviewed by different Centers within the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a Center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of our product candidates, the primary mode of action is attributable to the drug component of the product, which means that the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has primary jurisdiction over the premarket development, review and approval of our product candidates. Accordingly, we plan to investigate our products through the IND framework and seek approval through the NDA pathway. Based on our discussions with the FDA to date, we do not anticipate that the FDA will require a separate medical device authorization for the device, but this could change during the course of its review of any marketing application that we may submit. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of extensive pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with an applicable IND and other clinical study related regulations, sometimes referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice requirements, or cGMP;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Once a pharmaceutical product candidate is identified for development, it enters the pre-clinical testing stage. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some pre-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance, and may be imposed on all drug products within a certain class of drugs. The FDA also can impose partial clinical holds, for example, prohibiting the initiation of clinical trials of a certain duration or for a certain dose. 
 All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trial are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical trial and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. 
 Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. 
 14

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product is suspected or known to be unavoidably toxic, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. Involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 trials. Companies that conduct certain clinical trials also are required to register them and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, such as ClinicalTrials.gov in the United States, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, findings from other studies that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to the product, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk to human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. The clinical trial sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 NDA and FDA Review Process 
 The results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug, requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program user fee; although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. For example, the agency will waive the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits for review. 
 15

The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA typically makes a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. The decision to accept the NDA for filing means that the FDA has made a threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA’s goal to complete its substantive review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant is ten months from the receipt of the NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification and may go through multiple review cycles. 
 After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMPs to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. The review and evaluation of an NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. 
 There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a product for marketing in the United States, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-market testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 clinical trials to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 16

505(b)(2) Approval Process 
 Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA provides an alternate regulatory pathway for the FDA to approve a new product and permits reliance for such approval on published literature or an FDA finding of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product. Specifically, section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant for approval were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon published literature and/or the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug. Typically, 505(b)(2) applicants must perform additional trials to support the change from the previously approved drug and to further demonstrate the new product’s safety and effectiveness. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 Our subcutaneous formulation of furosemide is based upon an already approved version of furosemide in oral and IV formulations, rather than a new chemical entity product candidate. Accordingly, we submitted a 505(b)(2) application that relied on FDA’s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for previously-approved oral and/or IV furosemide in our clinical development plans and our NDA submission. We plan to use the 505(b)(2) pathway as well for other product candidates that we may develop.
 Regulation of Combination Products in the United States 
 Certain products may be comprised of components, such as drug components and device components that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities, and frequently by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Specifically, under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product may be: 

• | a product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, or device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any investigational drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the FDCA and its implementing regulations, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. The designation of a lead center generally eliminates the need to receive approvals from more than one FDA component for combination products, although it does not preclude consultations by the lead center with other components of FDA. The determination of which center will be the lead center is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a drug-device combination product is attributable to the drug product, the FDA center responsible for premarket review of the drug product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. The FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute. 
 A combination product with a drug primary mode of action generally would be reviewed and approved pursuant to the drug approval processes under the FDCA. In reviewing the NDA or 505(b)(2) application for such a product, however, FDA reviewers in the drug center could consult with their counterparts in the device center to ensure that the device component of the combination product met applicable requirements regarding safety, effectiveness, durability and performance. In addition, under FDA regulations, combination products are subject to cGMP requirements applicable to both drugs and devices, including the Quality System, or QS, regulations applicable to medical devices. 
 17

Drug-device combination products present unique challenges for competitors seeking approval of Abbreviated New Drug Applications, or ANDA, for generic versions of combination products. Generally, FDA reviews both the drug and device constituents of a proposed generic product to determine whether it is the same as the innovator product, including whether the basic design and operating principles of the device component are the same and whether minor differences require significant differences in labeling for safe and effective use. If FDA determines that the device component of the proposed generic product is not the same in terms of performance and critical design, or that the labeling is not the same, it generally will not approve the ANDA. Likewise, if FDA determines that certain clinical studies, such as clinical usability or human factors studies, are necessary to demonstrate the safety and/or effectiveness of the device component, FDA generally will not accept or approve an ANDA for a combination product and will instead require the submission of a full NDA or 505(b)(2) application. 
 Post-Marketing Requirements 
 Any products for which we receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse events with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, and product sampling and distribution requirements in accordance with the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, a part of the FDCA. Moreover, each component of a combination product retains their regulatory status (as a drug or device, for example) and is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. 
 Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion and advertising, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. In addition, a pharmaceutical company must comply with restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers typically may not market or promote such off-label uses. 
 In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that combination products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs applicable to drugs and devices, including certain QS requirements. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMPs, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. 
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development and impact approved products already on the market. 
 18

Other Regulatory Matters 
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
 The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, voluntary recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. In addition, even if a firm complies with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or effectiveness of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way. 
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the voluntary recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. 
 Orphan Designation and Exclusivity 
 The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Alternatively, orphan drug designation may be available if the disease of the condition affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. 
 Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product is the first to receive FDA approval of the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same orphan indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity, which may permit off-label use for the orphan indication. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA for the same orphan indication or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.
 U.S. Marketing Exclusivity 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications, including 505(b)(2) applications. The FDA provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA (including a 505(b)(2) application), or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. Three-year exclusivity is typically awarded to innovative changes to a previously-approved drug product, such as new indications, dosage forms or strengths. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving applications for drugs that do not have the innovative change, such as generic copies of the original, unmodified drug product. Three-year exclusivity blocks approval of 505(b)(2) applications and ANDAs but will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Orphan drug exclusivity, as described below, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods, including exclusivity attaching to certain patent certifications. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection and patent terms, may be granted based on the voluntary completion within certain timeframes of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.

European Orphan Designation and Exclusivity 
 In the European Union, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that affect not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community, or when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of such products in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the products. Additionally, orphan drug designation is only available where no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). 
 In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Market exclusivity would not prevent the approval of a similar drug that is shown to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 In the United States, our current and future operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS (such as the Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, our clinical research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable: 

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment to, or approval by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payers if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the anti-inducement law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 20

 
• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payer (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements under the Affordable Care Act, including the provision commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additionally, we are subject to state and non-U.S. equivalents of each of the healthcare laws described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payer. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not just governmental payers, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement we could be subject to penalties. Finally, there are state and non-U.S. laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. 
 We may develop products that, if approved, may be administered by a physician. Under currently applicable U.S. law, certain products not usually self-administered (including injectable drugs) may be eligible for coverage under Medicare through Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B is part of original Medicare, the federal health care program that provides health care benefits to the aged and disabled, and covers outpatient services and supplies, including certain pharmaceutical products, that are medically necessary to treat a beneficiary’s health condition. As a condition of receiving Medicare Part B reimbursement for a manufacturer’s eligible drugs, the manufacturer is required to participate in other government healthcare programs, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities that participate in the program. 
 21

In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price, or ASP, and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payers. 
 In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 Neither the U.S. government nor the U.S. courts have provided definitive guidance on the application of fraud and abuse laws to our business. Law enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing these laws, and it is possible that some of our practices may be challenged under these laws. Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties, and our business generally, will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices, including our arrangements with physicians and other healthcare providers, some of whom receive stock options as compensation for services provided, may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including, without limitation, the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. In addition, the approval and commercialization of any of our drug candidates outside the United States will also likely subject us to non-U.S. equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other non-U.S. laws. 
 If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs, which may also adversely affect our business. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payers have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; imposed a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established the a Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending. 
 22

Some of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to be implemented, and there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain Affordable Care Act-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. In July 2018, CMS announced that it is suspending further collections and payments to and from certain Affordable Care Act qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the Affordable Care Act risk adjustment program pending the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. The Texas District Court Judge, as well as the Trump Administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, and on December 30, 2018 the Texas District Court Judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal. It is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act.
 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and, due to legislation amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint”, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019, and in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. 
 23

While a number of these and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 Further, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to request access to certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval.  There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Our ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payers. Third-party payers decide which therapeutics they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payer may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payer’s determination that use of a therapeutic is: 

• | a covered benefit under its health plan;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | safe, effective and medically necessary;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | appropriate for the specific patient;
--+--------------------------------------


• | cost-effective; and
--+--------------------


• | neither experimental nor investigational.
--+------------------------------------------

 The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payer not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products if approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 In addition, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payer to payer. One third-party payer’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payers will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payer separately and will be a time-consuming process. 
 Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with branded drugs and drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payer is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payer supporting 
 24

scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our product on a payer-by-payer basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. A third-party payer’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payers. Private third-party payers tend to follow Medicare coverage and reimbursement limitations to a substantial degree, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Therefore, one payer’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that we successfully develop. 
 Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices is subject to governmental control in many countries. For example, in the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular therapy to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Other countries may allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical devices will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures. 
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if third-party payers fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on healthcare pricing. The downward pressure on the rise in healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 23 employees, including five in research and development, 10 in clinical and medical affairs, regulatory affairs and quality assurance and eight in finance, general administrative and executive administration, of which 21 were full-time employees and two of which were part- time employees. On January 28, 2019, based on the feedback we received from the FDA in the CRL and on our Type A and Type C meetings with the FDA, we reduced our workforce to 13 employees, 11 of which are full-time employees and two of which are part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our employee relations are good. 
Facilities 
 Our principal executive offices are located in a 13,066 square foot facility in Burlington, Massachusetts. The term of the lease for our facility extends through November 2022. Our facility houses our research and development, sales, marketing, finance and administrative activities. We believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future and that suitable additional space will be available as and when needed. 
Corporate Information
 We were formed as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware in February 2013 under the name scPharmaceuticals LLC and we converted to a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware in March 2014 under the name scPharmaceuticals Inc. Our website address is www.scpharmaceuticals.com.
