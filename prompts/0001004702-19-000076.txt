Item 1. | Business

General
OceanFirst Financial Corp. (the “Company”) is incorporated under Delaware law and serves as the holding company for OceanFirst Bank N.A. (the “Bank”). At December 31, 2018, the Company had consolidated total assets of $7.5 billion and total stockholders’ equity of $1.0 billion. The Company is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “FRB”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). Currently, the Company does not transact any material business other than through its subsidiary, the Bank.
The Company has been the holding company for the Bank since it acquired the stock of the Bank upon the Bank’s conversion from a Federally-chartered mutual savings bank to a Federally-chartered capital stock savings bank in 1996 (the “Conversion”). Effective January 31, 2018, the Bank converted to a national bank charter and the Company became a bank holding company. The conversions on January 31, 2018 do not change the entities which regulate and supervise the Bank and Company. The Bank’s principal business has been, and continues to be, attracting retail and business deposits in the communities surrounding its branch offices and investing those deposits primarily in loans, consisting of commercial real estate and other commercial loans which have become a key focus of the Bank and single-family, owner-occupied residential mortgage loans. The Bank also invests in other types of loans, including residential construction and consumer loans. In addition, the Bank invests in mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), securities issued by the U.S. Government and agencies thereof, corporate securities and other investments permitted by applicable law and regulations. The Bank’s revenues are derived principally from interest on its loans, and to a lesser extent, interest on its investment and mortgage-backed securities. The Bank also receives income from fees and service charges on loan and deposit products, Bankcard services, wealth management services and the sale of alternative investment products, e.g., mutual funds, annuities and life insurance. The Bank’s primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and mortgage-backed securities, investment maturities, Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances and other borrowings.

Market Area and Competition
The Bank is a regional bank, offering a wide variety of financial services to meet the needs of the communities it serves. The Bank operates its business through its branch office and headquarters located in Toms River, its administrative office located in Red Bank, 58 additional branch offices and three deposit production facilities located throughout central and southern New Jersey. The Bank also operates commercial loan production offices in New York City, the Philadelphia area and in Atlantic, Cape May, and Mercer Counties in New Jersey.

The Bank is the largest and oldest community-based financial institution headquartered in Ocean County, New Jersey, approximately midway between New York City and Philadelphia. The economy in the Bank’s primary market area, which represents the broader central and southern New Jersey market, is based upon a mixture of service and retail trade. Other employment is provided by a variety of wholesale trade, manufacturing, Federal, state and local government, hospitals and utilities. The area is also home to commuters working in areas in and around New York City and Philadelphia. The market area includes a significant number of vacation and second homes in the communities along the New Jersey shore. 
The Bank’s future growth opportunities will be partly influenced by the growth and stability of its geographic marketplace and the competitive environment. The Bank faces significant competition both in making loans and in attracting deposits. In addition, rapid technological changes and consumer preferences may result in increased competition for the Company’s other services, while a number of well-funded technology focused companies are innovating in the payments, distributed ledger, and cryptocurrency networks to disintermediate portions of the traditional banking model. The state of New Jersey, including the Bank’s primary market areas of central and southern New Jersey, is an attractive market to many financial institutions. Many of the Bank’s competitors are branches of significantly larger institutions headquartered out-of-market which have greater financial resources than the Bank. The Bank’s competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, internet-based providers and insurance companies. Its most direct competition for deposits has historically come from commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions although the Bank also faces competition for deposits from short-term money market funds, other corporate and government securities funds, internet-only providers and from other financial service institutions such as brokerage firms and insurance companies. The Bank distinguishes itself from large banking competitors through its local presence and ability to deliver personalized service. 
Community Involvement
The Bank proudly promotes a higher quality of life in the communities it serves through employee volunteer efforts and the work of OceanFirst Foundation (the “Foundation”). Employees are continually encouraged to become leaders in their communities and use the Bank’s support to help others. Through the Foundation, established in 1996, OceanFirst has granted over $37 million to enrich the lives of local citizens by supporting initiatives in health and human services, education, affordable housing, youth development and the arts.
Acquisitions
On May 2, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Cape Bancorp, Inc. (“Cape”) which added $1.5 billion to assets, $1.2 billion to loans, and $1.2 billion to deposits. The transaction was a market extension, creating a preeminent New Jersey based community banking franchise operating throughout central and southern New Jersey while also providing a gateway into the demographically attractive Philadelphia metropolitan area.
On November 30, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Ocean Shore Holding Company (“Ocean Shore”) which added $991.3 million to assets, $773.3 million to loans, and $875.1 million to deposits. The in-market transaction solidified the Bank’s position as the premier banking franchise in central and southern New Jersey with a strong core deposit franchise and enhanced operating scale.
On January 31, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Sun Bancorp, Inc. (“Sun”) which added $2.0 billion to assets, $1.5 billion to loans, and $1.6 billion to deposits. The Sun acquisition was another in-market transaction which enhanced the Bank’s position in its central and southern New Jersey markets.
On January 31, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Capital Bank of New Jersey (“Capital Bank”). Based on the $24.01 per share closing price of the Company’s common stock on January 31, 2019, the total transaction value was $76.8 million. The acquisition added $498 million to assets, $311 million to loans, and $449 million to deposits. This in-market transaction provides the Bank with significant market share in Cumberland and Atlantic counties in New Jersey.
These acquisitions have provided the Company with the opportunity to grow business lines, expand its geographic footprint and improve financial performance. The Company will continue to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities for those that can be expected to create stockholder value.

Lending Activities
Loan Portfolio Composition. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had total loans outstanding of $5.589 billion, of which $2.764 billion, or 49.5% of total loans, were commercial real estate, multi-family and land loans. The remainder of the portfolio consisted of $2.045 billion of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, or 36.6% of total loans; $475.2 million of consumer loans, primarily home equity loans and lines of credit, or 8.5% of total loans; and, $305.0 million of commercial loans, or 5.5% of total loans. At December 31, 2018 the Bank did not have any loans available-for-sale. At that same date, 35.3% of the Bank’s total loans had adjustable interest rates.
The types of loans that the Bank may originate are subject to Federal and state laws and regulations. Interest rates charged by the Bank on loans are affected by the demand for such loans and the supply of money available for lending purposes and the rates offered by competitors. These factors are, in turn, affected by, among other things, economic conditions, monetary policies of the Federal government, including the FRB, and legislative tax policies.
The following table sets forth the composition of the Bank’s loan portfolio in dollar amounts and as a percentage of the portfolio at the dates indicated.

Commercial Real Estate, Multi-Family and Land Lending. The Bank originates commercial real estate loans that are secured by properties, or properties under construction, generally used for business purposes such as office, industrial or retail facilities. A substantial majority of the Bank’s commercial real estate loans are located in its primary market area. The Bank generally originates commercial real estate loans with terms of up to ten years and amortization schedules up to thirty years with fixed or adjustable rates. Fixed rate loans typically contain prepayment penalties over the initial term. In reaching its decision on whether to make a commercial real estate loan, the Bank considers the net operating income of the property and the borrower’s expertise, credit history and profitability among other factors.
At December 31, 2018, the Bank’s total loans outstanding were $5.589 billion, of which $2.764 billion, or 49.5% of total loans, were commercial real estate loans, as compared to $1.757 billion, or 44.2% of total loans, at December 31, 2017. The Bank continues to grow this market segment primarily through the addition of experienced commercial lenders and has commercial lending teams in various New Jersey counties including Atlantic, Cape May, Mercer, Monmouth, and Ocean as well as teams in New York City and the Philadelphia area. Of the total commercial real estate portfolio, 26.8% is considered owner-occupied, whereby the underlying business owner occupies a majority of the property.
The commercial real estate portfolio includes loans for the construction of commercial properties. Typically, these loans are underwritten based upon commercial leases in place prior to funding. In many cases, commercial construction loans are extended to owners that intend to occupy the property for business operations, in which case the loan is based upon the financial capacity of the related business and the owner of the business. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had an outstanding balance in commercial construction loans of $181.7 million, as compared to $108.0 million at December 31, 2017. 
The Bank also originates multi-family mortgage loans and land loans on a limited basis. The Bank’s multi-family loans and land loans at December 31, 2018 totaled $387.0 million and $8.7 million, respectively, as compared to $90.1 million and $10.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017.
One-to-Four Family Mortgage Lending. The Bank offers both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage (“ARM”) loans secured by one-to-four family residences with maturities up to 30 years. The majority of such loans are secured by property located in the Bank’s primary market area. Loan originations are typically generated by commissioned loan representatives in the exclusive employment of the Bank and are largely derived from contacts within the local real estate industry, members of the local communities and the Bank’s existing or past customers. On occasion the Bank purchases loans originated by other banks.
At December 31, 2018, $2.045 billion, or 36.6% of total loans, were one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, primarily single family and owner occupied. To a lesser extent and included in this activity are residential mortgage loans secured by seasonal second homes and non-owner occupied investment properties. The average size of the Bank’s one-to-four family mortgage loans was approximately $238,000 at December 31, 2018.
7

The Bank currently offers several ARM loan programs with interest rates which adjust every three, five or ten years. The Bank’s ARM loans generally provide for periodic caps of 2% or 3% and an overall cap of 6% on the increase or decrease in the interest rate at any adjustment date and over the life of the loan. The interest rate on these loans is indexed to the applicable three-, five- or ten-year U.S. Treasury constant maturity yield, with a repricing margin which ranges generally from 2.75% to 3.50% above the index. The Bank also offers three-, five-, seven- and ten-year ARM loans which operate as fixed-rate loans for the first three, five, seven or ten years and then convert to one-year ARM loans for the remainder of the term. The ARM loans are then indexed to a margin of generally 2.75% to 3.50% above the one-year U.S. Treasury constant maturity yield.
Generally, ARM loans pose credit risks different than the risks inherent in fixed-rate loans, primarily because as interest rates rise, the payments of the borrower rise, thereby increasing the potential for delinquency and default. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying property may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. In order to minimize risks, borrowers of ARM loans with an initial fixed period of five years or less must qualify based on the greater of the note rate plus 2% or the fully-indexed rate. Seven- to ten-year ARMs must qualify based on the note rate. The Bank does not originate ARM loans that can result in negative amortization. 
The Bank’s fixed-rate mortgage loans are currently made for terms from 10 to 30 years. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2014, the Bank generally retained the servicing on loans sold. Currently, servicing rights are generally sold as part of the loan sale. The Bank generally holds its residential loans for its portfolio, and may sell a portion of its longer-term, fixed-rate loans after reviewing volume and yield and after evaluating interest rate risk and capital management considerations. The retention of fixed-rate mortgage loans may increase the level of interest rate risk exposure of the Bank, as the rates on these loans will not adjust during periods of rising interest rates and the loans can be subject to substantial increases in prepayments during periods of falling interest rates. Prior to 2017, the Bank generally sold much of its 30-year, fixed-rate, one-to-four family loans in the secondary mortgage market primarily to manage interest rate risk. With the rise in market interest rates and the reduction in refinance volume, the Bank retained most of its 30-year fixed-rate loan originations in 2017 and 2018 to replace repayments on the existing residential mortgage loan portfolio.
The Bank’s policy is to originate one-to-four family residential mortgage loans in amounts up to 80% of the lower of the appraised value or the selling price of the property securing the loan and up to 95% of the appraised value or selling price if private mortgage insurance is obtained. Appraisals are obtained for loans secured by real estate properties. The weighted average loan-to-value ratio of the Bank’s one-to-four family mortgage loans was 59% at December 31, 2018 based on appraisal values at the time of origination. Title insurance is typically required for first mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans originated by the Bank include due-on-sale clauses which provide the Bank with the contractual right to declare the loan immediately due and payable in the event the borrower transfers ownership of the property without the Bank’s consent. Due-on-sale clauses are an important means of adjusting the rates on the Bank’s fixed-rate residential mortgage loan portfolio and the Bank has generally exercised its rights under these clauses.
The Bank has made, and may continue to make, residential mortgage loans that will not qualify as Qualified Mortgage Loans under the Dodd-Frank Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) regulations. See “Risk Factors – The Dodd-Frank Act imposes obligations on originators of residential mortgage loans, such as the Bank.”
Included in the Bank’s one-to-four family loan balance at December 31, 2018, were residential construction loans which totaled $55.3 million. The Bank originates residential construction loans primarily on a construction/permanent basis with such loans converting to an amortizing loan following the completion of the construction phase. Most of the Bank’s residential construction loans are made to individuals building a residence.
Construction lending, by its nature, entails additional risks compared to one-to-four family mortgage lending, attributable primarily to the fact that funds are advanced based upon a security interest in a project which is not yet complete. The Bank addresses these risks through its underwriting policies and procedures and its experienced staff.
Consumer Loans. At December 31, 2018, the Bank’s consumer loans totaled $475.2 million, or 8.5% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio. Of the total consumer loan portfolio, home equity loans comprised $158.1 million; home equity lines of credit comprised $195.5 million; student loans comprised $119.3 million; overdraft line of credit loans totaled $1.8 million; and loans on savings accounts and other consumer loans totaled $516,000.
The Bank originates home equity loans typically as fixed-rate loans with terms ranging from 5 to 20 years. The Bank also offers variable-rate home equity lines of credit. Home equity loans and lines of credit are based on the applicant’s income and their ability to repay and are secured by a mortgage on the underlying real estate, typically owner-occupied, one-to-four family residences. Generally, the loan when combined with the balance of any applicable first mortgage lien, may not exceed 80% of the appraised value of the property at the time of the loan commitment. The Bank charges an early termination fee should a home equity loan or line of credit be closed within two or three years of origination. A borrower is required to make monthly payments of principal and interest, at a minimum of $50, based upon a 10-, 15- or 20-year amortization period. Certain home equity lines of credit require the payment of interest-only during the first five years with fully-amortizing payments thereafter. At December 31, 2018, these loans totaled $26.3 million, as compared to $31.2 million at December 31, 2017.
8

Generally, the adjustable rate of interest charged is based upon the prime rate of interest (as published in the Wall Street Journal), although the range of interest rates charged may vary from 1.0% below prime to 1.5% over prime. The loans have an 18% lifetime cap on interest rate adjustments.
The student loans are targeted at high income, strong credit score borrowers in stable fields, such as doctors, nurses, dentists, lawyers and graduates of the top business schools. These loans are refinancing of other student loans and are made primarily after the borrowers have finished their education, are employed, have a strong credit score and verified income, and have demonstrated an ability and willingness to pay their student loans.
Commercial and Industrial Lending. At December 31, 2018, commercial and industrial (“C&I”) loans totaled $305.0 million, or 5.5% of the Bank’s total loans outstanding. The Bank originates commercial and industrial loans and lines of credit (including for working capital; fixed asset purchases; and acquisition, receivable and inventory financing) primarily in the Bank’s market area. In underwriting commercial and industrial loans and credit lines, the Bank reviews and analyzes financial history and capacity, collateral value, strength and character of the principals, and general payment history of the principal borrowers in coming to a credit decision. The Bank generally originates C&I loans secured by the assets of the business including accounts receivable, inventory, fixtures, etc. The Bank generally requires the personal guarantee of the principal borrowers for all commercial and industrial loans. Risk of loss on a commercial and industrial business loan is dependent largely on the borrower’s ability to remain financially able to repay the loan from ongoing operations.
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. The Board establishes the loan approval policies of the Bank based on total exposure to the individual borrower. The Board has authorized the approval of loans by a minimum of two officers of the Bank or the Management Credit Committee, on a scale which requires approval by personnel with progressively higher levels of credit approval authority as the loan amount increases. Pursuant to applicable regulations, loans to one borrower generally cannot exceed 15% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital. 
Due to the recent acquisitions, a significant portion of the loan portfolio was underwritten according to the underwriting standards and guidelines of the acquired banks. Acquired loans have been evaluated under OceanFirst’s credit risk management policies during pre-closing due diligence and during post-closing risk rating reviews.
In addition to internal credit reviews, the Bank has engaged an independent firm specializing in commercial loan reviews to examine a selection of commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans, and provide management with objective analysis regarding the quality of these loans throughout the year. The independent firm reviewed 57% of the outstanding loan balances for the Company’s commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans during 2018. Their conclusion was that the Bank’s internal credit reviews are consistent with both Bank policy and general industry practice.
Loan Servicing. Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, making inspections as required of mortgaged premises, contacting delinquent borrowers, supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of unremedied defaults, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans. The Bank also services mortgage loans for others. On October 31, 2014, the Bank sold most of the servicing rights on residential mortgage loans serviced for Federal agencies. All of the remaining loans currently being serviced for others are loans which were originated by the Bank. At December 31, 2018, the Bank was servicing $95.1 million of loans for others.
Delinquencies and Classified Assets. The steps taken by the Bank with respect to delinquencies vary depending on the nature of the loan and period of delinquency. When a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan, the Bank takes a number of steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status. The Bank sends the borrower a written notice of non-payment after the loan is first past due. In the event payment is not then received, additional letters and phone calls generally are made. The Bank may offer to modify the terms or take other forbearance actions which afford the borrower an opportunity to satisfy the loan terms. If the loan is still not brought current and it becomes necessary for the Bank to take legal action, which typically occurs after a loan is delinquent at least 120 days or more, the Bank will either; (i) commence litigation to realize on the collateral, including foreclosure proceedings against any real property that secures the loan; or (ii) sell non-performing loans where foreclosure proceedings may or may not have been initiated. If a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current, paid in full, or an acceptable workout accommodation is not agreed upon before the foreclosure sale, the real property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure. Foreclosure timelines in New Jersey are among the longest in the nation and have remained protracted over the past several years.
The Bank’s internal Asset Classification Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, reviews and classifies the Bank’s assets quarterly and reports the results of its review to the Board. As part of this process, the Chief Risk Officer compiles a quarterly list of all criticized and classified loans, and a narrative report of classified commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, multi-family, land and construction loans. The Bank classifies assets in accordance with certain regulatory guidelines and definitions. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $74.8 million of assets, including all other real estate owned (“OREO”), classified as “Substandard.” There were no assets classified as “Doubtful” or as “Loss.” At December 31, 2017, the Bank had $60.7 million of assets, including all OREO, classified as “Substandard.” There were no assets classified as “Doubtful” or as “Loss.” Assets which do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses, such as past 
9

delinquencies, are designated “Special Mention.” Special Mention assets totaled $35.8 million at December 31, 2018, as compared to $25.5 million at December 31, 2017.
Non-Accrual Loans and OREO. The following table sets forth information regarding non-accrual loans and OREO, excluding Purchase Credit Impaired (“PCI”) loans. The Bank obtained PCI loans as part of its acquisitions of Colonial American Bank (“Colonial American”), Cape, Ocean Shore and Sun. PCI loans are accounted for at fair value, based upon the present value of expected future cash flows with no related allowance for loan losses. PCI loans totaled $8.9 million and $1.7 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. It is the policy of the Bank to cease accruing interest on loans 90 days or more past due or in the process of foreclosure. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the amount of interest income that would have been recognized on non-accrual loans if such loans had continued to perform in accordance with their contractual terms was $419,000, $639,000, and $391,000, respectively.

(1) | The loans acquired from Sun, Ocean Shore, Cape, and Colonial American were recorded at fair value. The net credit mark on these loans, not reflected in the allowance for loan losses, was $31,647, $17,531, $25,973, and $2,202 at December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015 respectively. There were no net credit marks on loans at December 31, 2014. 


(2) | Non-performing assets consist of non-performing loans and OREO. Non-performing loans consist of all loans 90 days or more past due and other loans in the process of foreclosure.

Non-performing loans totaled $17.4 million at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $3.5 million, as compared to December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of one commercial loan relationship during the first quarter of 2018. Non-performing loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017 do not include $8.9 million and $1.7 million, respectively, of PCI loans acquired from Colonial American, Cape, Ocean Shore and Sun. The Company’s OREO totaled $1.4 million at December 31, 2018, a $6.8 million decrease from December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of a hotel, golf, and banquet facility.
Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on management’s evaluation of the Company’s past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and current economic conditions. Additions to the allowance arise from charges to operations through the provision for loan losses or from the recovery of amounts previously charged-off. The allowance is reduced by loan charge-offs. A description of the methodology used in establishing the allowance for loan losses is set forth in the section “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Policies, Allowance for Loan Losses.”
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Bank’s allowance for loan losses was 0.30% and 0.40% of total loans, respectively. The net credit mark on all acquired loans, not reflected in the allowance for loan losses, was $31.6 million and $17.5 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total non-performing loans was 95.19% at December 31, 2018, an increase from 75.35% in the prior year. The Bank had non-accrual loans of $17.4 million at December 31, 2018, a decrease from $20.9 million at December 31, 2017. The Bank will continue to monitor its allowance for loan losses as conditions dictate.

The increase in net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to charge-offs of $2.1 million on the bulk sales of non-performing and under-performing loans. The elevated charge-offs in 2014 were due to the bulk sale of non-performing residential and consumer loans which resulted in a charge-off of $5.0 million on these loans.

Reserve for Repurchased Loans and Loss Sharing Obligations. The reserve for repurchased loans and loss sharing obligations was established to provide for expected losses related to repurchase requests which may be received on residential mortgage loans previously sold to investors. The reserve also includes an estimate of the Bank’s obligation under a loss sharing arrangement with the FHLB relating to loans sold into their Mortgage Partnership Finance (“MPF”) program. The Company prepares a comprehensive analysis of the adequacy of the reserve for repurchased loans and loss sharing obligations at each quarter-end.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company maintained a reserve for repurchased loans and loss sharing obligations of $1.3 million and $463,000, respectively. Provisions for losses are charged to gain on sale of loans and credited to the reserve while actual losses are charged to the reserve. Losses were $0, $383,000, and $140,000, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. During 2018, the reserve increased by $1.0 million due to the acquisition of Sun. The Company evaluates the adequacy of the reserve quarterly. As a result of this review, the reserve was decreased by $200,000 during 2018, which was included in other income. Included in the losses on loans repurchased are cash settlements in lieu of repurchases. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no outstanding loan repurchase requests. 
Management believes that the Bank has established and maintained the reserve for repurchased loans and loss sharing obligations at adequate levels, however, future adjustments to the reserve may be necessary due to economic, operating or other conditions beyond the Bank’s control.

Investment Activities
The investment policy of the Bank as established by the Board attempts to provide and maintain liquidity, generate a favorable return on investments without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, and complement the Bank’s lending activities. Specifically, the Bank’s policies generally limit investments to government and Federal agency-backed securities, municipal securities and corporate debt obligations. The Bank’s policies provide that all investment purchases must be evaluated internally for creditworthiness and be approved by two officers (any two of the Senior Vice President/Treasurer, the Executive Vice President/Chief Financial Officer, and the President/Chief Executive Officer). The Company’s investment policy mirrors that of the Bank except that it allows for the purchase of equity securities in limited amounts.
Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase. If the Bank has the intent and the ability at the time of purchase to hold securities until maturity, they may be classified as held-to-maturity. Investment and mortgage-backed securities identified as held-to-maturity are carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, which are recognized as adjustments to interest income. Securities to be held for indefinite periods of time, but not necessarily to maturity are classified as available-for-sale. Such securities are carried at estimated fair value and unrealized gains and losses, net of related tax effect, are excluded from earnings, but are included as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. See “Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.”
Mortgage-backed Securities. Mortgage-backed securities represent a participation interest in a pool of single-family or multi-family mortgages, the principal and interest payments on which, in general, are passed from the mortgage originators, through intermediaries that pool and repackage the participation interests in the form of securities, to investors such as the Bank. Such intermediaries may be private issuers, or agencies including the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Company (“FHLMC”), the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”), the Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”), and the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) that guarantee the payment of principal and interest to investors. Mortgage-backed securities typically are issued with stated principal amounts, and the securities are backed by pools of mortgages that have loans with interest rates that are within a certain range and with varying maturities. The underlying pool of mortgages can be composed of either fixed-rate or ARM loans.
The actual maturity of a mortgage-backed security varies, depending on when the mortgagors repay or prepay the underlying mortgages. Prepayments of the underlying mortgages may shorten the life of the security, thereby affecting its yield to maturity and the related estimated fair value of the mortgage-backed security. The prepayments of the underlying mortgages depend on many factors, including the type of mortgages, the coupon rates, the age of the mortgages, the geographical location of the underlying real estate collateralizing the mortgages, the general levels of market interest rates, and general economic conditions. GNMA mortgage-backed securities that are backed by assumable Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) or Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) loans generally have a longer life than conventional non-assumable loans underlying FHLMC and FNMA mortgage-backed securities. During periods of falling mortgage interest rates, prepayments generally increase, as opposed to periods of increasing interest rates when prepayments generally decrease. If the interest rate of underlying mortgages significantly exceeds the prevailing market interest rates offered for mortgage loans, refinancing generally increases and accelerates the prepayment of the underlying mortgages. Prepayment experience is more difficult to estimate for adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities.
The Bank has investments in mortgage-backed securities and has utilized such investments to complement its lending activities. The Bank invests in a large variety of mortgage-backed securities, including ARM, balloon and fixed-rate securities and all were directly insured or guaranteed by either FHLMC, FNMA, GNMA or SBA.

Investment Securities. At December 31, 2018, the amortized cost of the Company’s investment securities totaled $306.3 million, and consisted of $115.5 million of U.S. agency obligations, $124.0 million of state and municipal obligations and $66.8 million of corporate debt securities. Each of the U.S. agency obligations are rated AA+ by Standard and Poor’s and Aaa by Moody’s. The state and municipal obligations are issued by government entities with current credit ratings that are considered investment grade ranging from a high of AAA to a low of A-. The corporate debt securities include two issues totaling $4.4 million issued by community banks, which are not rated by any of the credit rating services. Excluding these items, the remaining corporate debt securities are issued by various corporate entities with an amortized cost of $62.4 million. Credit ratings range from a high of AA- to a low of BB as rated by one of the internationally-recognized credit rating services. See “Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Sources of Funds
General. Deposits, repayments and prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, proceeds from sales of loans, investment maturities, cash flows generated from operations and FHLB advances and other borrowings are the primary sources of the Bank’s funds for use in lending, investing and for other general purposes.
Deposits. The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms to retail, government and business customers. The Bank’s deposits consist of money market accounts, savings accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, non-interest-bearing accounts and time deposits. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market rates, prevailing interest rates and competition. The Bank’s deposits are obtained predominantly from the areas in which its branch offices are located. The Bank relies on its community-banking focus, stressing customer service and long-standing relationships with its customers to attract and retain these deposits; however, market interest rates and rates offered by competing financial institutions could significantly affect the Bank’s ability to attract and retain deposits.
At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $124.3 million in time deposits in amounts of $250,000 or more maturing as follows:

Maturity Period | Amount | | WeightedAverageRate

Borrowings. The Bank has obtained advances from the FHLB for cash management and interest rate risk management purposes or as an alternative to deposit funds and may do so in the future as part of its operating strategy. FHLB term advances are also used to acquire certain other assets as may be deemed appropriate for investment purposes. Advances are collateralized primarily by certain of the Bank’s mortgage loans and investment and mortgage-backed securities and secondarily by the Bank’s investment in capital stock of the FHLB. The maximum amount that the FHLB will advance to member institutions, including the Bank, fluctuates from time-to-time in accordance with the policies of the FHLB. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $449.4 million in outstanding advances from the FHLB. The Bank also has outstanding municipal letters of credit issued by the FHLB used to secure government deposits. At December 31, 2018, these municipal letters of credit totaled $950.0 million.
The Bank also borrows funds using securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Under this form of borrowing specific U.S. Government agency and/or mortgage-backed securities are pledged as collateral to secure the borrowing. These pledged securities are held by a third-party custodian. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had borrowed $61.8 million through securities sold under agreements to repurchase.
The Bank can also borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (“Reserve Bank”) under the primary credit program. Primary credit is available on a short-term basis, typically overnight, at a rate above the Federal Open Market Committee’s Federal funds target rate. All extensions of credit by the Reserve Bank must be secured. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had no borrowings outstanding with the Reserve Bank.
Subsidiary Activities
At December 31, 2018, the Bank owned 8 direct subsidiaries:

• | OceanFirst REIT Holdings, Inc. was established in 2007 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank and now acts as the holding company for OceanFirst Management Corp, which was organized in 2016 for the purpose of holding and managing investment securities, including the stock of OceanFirst Realty Corp. OceanFirst Realty Corp. was established in 1997 and invests in qualifying mortgage loans and is intended to qualify as a real estate investment trust, which may, among other things, be utilized by the Company to raise capital in the future.


• | 975 Holdings, LLC, Hooper Holdings, LLC, and TRREO Holdings, LLC were established in 2010, 2015, and 2016, respectively, as wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Bank. Casaba Real Estate Holding Corporation and Cohensey Bridge, L.L.C. were acquired by the Bank as wholly-owned subsidiaries as part of its acquisition of Cape in 2016. All of these subsidiaries are maintained for the purpose of taking legal possession of certain repossessed collateral for resale to third parties.


• | Prosperis Financial, L.L.C. was acquired by the Bank as a wholly-owned subsidiary as part of its acquisition of Sun in 2018. This subsidiary offered client access to various investment and advisory services and is currently inactive.


• | OceanFirst Services, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank that is now the holding company for OFB Reinsurance, Ltd., which was established in 2002 to reinsure a percentage of the private mortgage insurance (“PMI”) risks on one-to-four family residential mortgages originated by the Bank. There are no current reinsurance contracts in force by OFB Reinsurance, Ltd.

15

In addition to the Bank, the Company has OceanFirst Risk Management, Inc. as a direct subsidiary. OceanFirst Risk Management Inc. is a captive insurance company that insures certain risks relating to the business of the Bank and the Company. 
Personnel
As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had 787 full-time employees and 105 part-time employees, for a total of 892 employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and the Bank considers its relationship with its employees to be good. 
On January 31, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Capital, which added 65 full-time and 8 part time employees, for a total of 73 employees. 
REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
General
Prior to January 2018, the Bank was a Federally-chartered savings bank, and the Company was registered as a savings and loan holding company. Effective January 31, 2018, the Bank converted to a national bank charter and the Company became a bank holding company (“BHC”) under Section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”) and is subject to the requirements of the BHC Act, including required approvals for investments in or acquisitions of banking organizations, or entities involved in activities that are deemed closely related to banking, capital adequacy standards and limitations on nonbanking activities. The Company is registered with the FRB and is required by Federal law to file reports with, and comply with the rules and regulations of the FRB. The Bank is a member of the FHLB System and, with respect to deposit insurance, of the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) managed by the FDIC. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC, as its primary Federal regulator, and the FDIC, as the deposit insurer. The Bank must file reports with the OCC and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to consummating certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other insured depository institutions. The OCC conducts periodic examinations to test the Bank’s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors and to ensure the safe and sound operation of the Bank. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. 
In addition, the Company elected to become a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act amendments to the BHC Act (the “GLBA”). A financial holding company, and the nonbank companies under its control, are permitted to engage in activities considered financial in nature or incidental to financial activities and, if the FRB determines that they pose no risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system in general, activities are considered complementary to financial activities.
The banking industry is highly regulated. Statutory and regulatory controls increase a BHC’s cost of doing business and limit the options of its management to deploy assets and maximize income. The following discussion is not intended to be a complete list of all the activities regulated by the banking laws or of the impact of such laws and regulations on the Company or the Bank. It is intended only to briefly summarize some material provisions.
The description of statutory provisions and regulations applicable to national banks and BHCs set forth in this Form 10-K does not purport to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and the Company, is subject to change and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations involved.
The Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affects the lending, deposit, investment, compliance and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various Federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The Federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act are still not yet known. In addition, as a result of the 2016 election, there is some chance that certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may be repealed or amended.
The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets. Institutions such as the Bank with $10 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators (the OCC in the case of the Bank), although the CFPB will have back-up authority over such institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act also weakens the Federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and Federal savings associations, and gives state attorney generals the ability to enforce Federal consumer protection laws.
16

Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act includes a series of provisions covering mortgage loan origination standards affecting, among other things, originator compensation, minimum repayment standards and prepayments. The Dodd-Frank Act requires originators to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on documented information that a borrower has a reasonable ability to repay a particular mortgage loan over the long term. If the originator cannot meet this standard, the burden is on the lender to demonstrate the appropriateness of its policies and the strength of its controls. The Dodd-Frank Act contains an exception from this Ability-To-Repay rule for “Qualified Mortgages.” The rule sets forth specific underwriting criteria for a loan to qualify as a Qualified Mortgage. The criteria generally exclude loans that (1) are interest-only, (2) have excessive upfront points or fees, or (3) have negative amortization features, balloon payments, or terms in excess of 30 years. To be defined as an Ability-To-Repay Qualified Mortgage, the underwriting criteria also impose a maximum debt to income ratio of 43%, based upon documented and verifiable information. If a loan meets these criteria and is not a “higher priced loan” as defined in FRB regulations, the CFPB rule establishes a safe harbor preventing a consumer from asserting the failure of the originator to establish the consumer’s Ability-To-Repay. Additionally, conforming fixed-rate loans with a debt-to-income ratio greater than 43% would also qualify as an Ability-To-Repay Qualified Mortgage based upon an automated loan approval from one of the government sponsored mortgage entities. However, a consumer may assert the lender’s failure to comply with the Ability-To-Repay rule for all residential mortgage loans other than Qualified Mortgages, and may challenge a lender’s determination that a loan was in fact a Qualified Mortgage. The qualified mortgage rule has yet to be fully addressed by the foreclosure courts and depending on the interpretation of these rules, collectability of non-qualifying mortgages could be subject to future action by the courts. See “Risk Factors – The Dodd-Frank Act imposes obligations on originators of residential mortgage loans, such as the Bank.” 
The Dodd-Frank Act also directed the FRB to issue rules to limit debit card interchange fees (the fees that issuing banks charge merchants each time a consumer uses a debit card) collected by banks with assets of $10 billion or more. The FRB issued a final rule which caps an issuer’s debit card interchange base fee at twenty-one cents ($0.21) per transaction and allows an additional 5 basis point charge per transaction to cover fraud losses. The FRB also issued an interim final rule that allows a fraud-prevention adjustment of one cent ($0.01) per transaction conditioned upon an issuer adopting effective fraud prevention policies and procedures. The Bank’s average interchange fee per transaction is forty cents ($0.40). The Dodd-Frank Act exempts from the FRB’s rule banks with assets less than $10 billion, such as the Bank. Although exempt from the rule, market forces in future periods may result in reduced fees charged by all issuers, regardless of asset size, which may result in reduced revenues for the Bank. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Bank’s revenues from interchange fees was $8.5 million, an increase of $2.2 million from 2017.
The Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly-traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments, and allows greater access by stockholders to the company’s proxy material by authorizing the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a company’s proxy materials. The legislation also directs the Federal banking agencies to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded. The SEC has not yet implemented rules giving stockholders access to company proxy statements, and the banking agency rules primarily address incentive compensation. The rules prohibit incentive-based compensation that would encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that would expose the bank to inappropriate risks by providing compensation that could lead to a material financial loss.
It is still uncertain to what extent and how full implementation of and promulgation of rules under the Dodd-Frank Act, will occur and affect the Bank.
Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRGCPA”), adopted in May of 2018, was intended to provide regulatory relief to midsized and regional banks. While many of its provisions are aimed at larger institutions, such as raising the threshold to be considered a systemically important financial institution to $250 billion in assets from $50 billion in assets, many of its provisions will provide regulatory relief to those institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Among other things, the EGRGPA increased the asset threshold for depository institutions and holding companies to perform stress tests required under Dodd Frank from $10 billion to $250 billion, exempted institutions with less than $10 billion in consolidated assets from the Volker Rule, raised the threshold for the requirement that publicly traded holding companies have a risk committee from $10 billion in consolidated assets to $50 billion in consolidated assets, directed the federal banking agencies to adopt a “community bank leverage ratio,” applicable to institutions and holding companies with less than $10 billion in assets, and to provide that compliance with the new ratio would be deemed compliance with all capital requirements applicable to the institution or holding company, and provided that residential mortgage loans meeting certain criteria and originated by institutions with less than $10 billion in total assets will be deemed to meet the “ability to repay rule” under the Truth in Lending Act. In addition, the EGRGCPA limited the definition of loans that would be subject to the higher risk weighting applicable to High Volatility Commercial Real Estate.
Many of the regulations needed to implement the EGRGCPA have yet to be promulgated by the federal banking agencies, and so it is still uncertain how full implementation of the EGRGCPA will affect the Company and the Bank.

Bank Holding Company Regulation
The Company is a BHC and is supervised by the FRB and is required to file reports with the FRB and provide such additional information as the FRB may require. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to examination by the FRB.
The BHC Act prohibits the companies which do not elect to become financial holding companies, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to subsidiary banks, except that a BHC may, upon application, engage in, and may own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the FRB to be so closely related to banking “as to be a proper incident thereto.” The BHC Act requires prior approval by the FRB of the acquisition by bank holding companies of more than 5% of the voting stock of any other entity, including another bank. Satisfactory capital ratios and Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) ratings and anti-money laundering policies are generally prerequisites to obtaining federal regulatory approval to make acquisitions. FRB regulations provide that a BHC is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank in circumstances in which it might not do so absent those regulations.
Holding Company Capital Requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act requires capital rules and the application of the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies. In addition to making bank holding companies subject to the same capital requirements as their bank subsidiaries, these provisions (often referred to as the Collins Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act) were also intended to eliminate or significantly reduce the use of hybrid capital instruments, especially trust preferred securities, as regulatory capital. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires banking regulators to seek to make capital standards countercyclical, so that the required levels of capital increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction. 
At December 31, 2018, the Company exceeded all regulatory capital requirements currently applicable. The following table presents the Company’s capital position at December 31, 2018:

 | | | | | | | Capital 
As of December 31, 2018 | Actual Capital | | Required Capital | | Excess Amount | | Actual Percent | Required Percent | 
OceanFirst Financial Corp: | (dollars in thousands) | | | | | 
Tier 1 capital (to average assets) | $ | 709,972 | | | $ | 285,199 | | $ | 424,773 | 9.96 | % | | 4.000 | %

Dividends. The FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory pressures to reclassify and charge off loans and to establish additional loan loss reserves can have the effect of reducing current operating earnings and thus impacting an institution’s ability to pay dividends. Further, regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory review of capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the Company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the Company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the Company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also states that a holding company should inform the FRB supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction in the amount of such instruments outstanding from the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred compared with the end of such quarter. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
Acquisition of the Company. Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act (“CBCA”) and applicable regulations, a notice must be submitted to the FRB if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire 10% or more of the Company’s outstanding voting stock, unless the FRB has found that the acquisition will not result in a change of control of the Company. Under CBCA, the FRB has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the anti-trust effects of the acquisition. Any company that so acquires control would then be subject to regulation as a BHC.
18

Financial Holding Company Status
When the Bank converted to a national bank charter and the Company became a BHC, the Company elected to become a financial holding company. Financial holding companies may engage in a broader scope of activities than a BHC. In addition, financial holding companies may undertake certain activities without prior FRB approval. 
A financial holding company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. "Financial in nature" activities include securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and insurance agency activities; merchant banking; and activities that the FRB determines to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity or which are complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk. 
A financial holding company that engages in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity but not previously authorized by the FRB must obtain approval from the FRB before engaging in such activity. Also, a financial holding company may seek FRB approval to engage in an activity that is complementary to a financial activity, if it shows, among other things, that the activity does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of its insured depository institutions or the financial system.
A financial holding company generally may acquire a company (other than a bank holding company, bank or savings association) engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature without prior approval from the FRB. Prior FRB approval is required, however, before the financial holding company may acquire control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a BHC, bank or savings association. In addition, under the FRB's merchant banking regulations, a financial holding company is authorized to invest in companies that engage in activities that are not financial in nature, as long as the financial holding company makes its investment with the intention of limiting the duration of the investment, does not manage the company on a day-to-day basis, and the company does not cross-market its products or services with any of the financial holding company's controlled depository institutions.
If any subsidiary bank of a financial holding company ceases to be “well-capitalized” or “well-managed” and fails to correct its condition within the time period that the FRB specifies, the FRB has authority to order the financial holding company to divest its subsidiary banks. Alternatively, the financial holding company may elect to limit its activities and the activities of its subsidiaries to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not a financial holding company. If any subsidiary bank of a financial holding company receives a rating under the CRA of less than “satisfactory,” then the financial holding company is prohibited from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies, banks or savings associations until the rating is raised to “satisfactory” or better.
Regulation of Bank Subsidiary
Business Activities. The operations of the Bank are subject to requirements and restrictions under Federal law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted, and limitations on the types of investments that may be made and the types of services which may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the Bank. Approval of the OCC is required for branching, bank mergers in which the continuing bank is a national bank and in connection with certain fundamental corporate changes affecting the Bank. There are various legal limitations, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, as implemented by Regulation W which govern the extent to which a bank subsidiary may finance or otherwise supply funds to its holding company or its holding company’s non-bank subsidiaries. 
Capital Requirements. FDIC regulations require banks to maintain minimum levels of capital including: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.0%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. These capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.
As noted, the risk-based capital standards for banks require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6%, and 8%, respectively. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. Unrealized gains and losses on certain “available-for-sale” securities are included for purposes of calculating 
19

regulatory capital unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. The Bank has exercised the opt-out. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, federal regulators take into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and have the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual banks where necessary.
In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in over four years beginning January 1, 2016. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in incrementally, which started at 0.625% on January 1, 2016, and increased to 1.25% on January 1, 2017, 1.875% on January 1, 2018, and 2.50% on January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer requirement became effective. Both the Bank and the Company are in compliance with the capital conservation buffer requirements applicable to them.
The Federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have also adopted regulations to require an assessment of an institution’s exposure to declines in the economic value of a bank’s capital due to changes in interest rates when assessing the bank’s capital adequacy. Under such a risk assessment, examiners evaluate a bank’s capital for interest rate risk on a case-by-case basis, with consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors. Institutions with significant interest rate risk may be required to hold additional capital. According to the Federal banking agencies, applicable considerations include: quality of the bank’s interest rate risk management process; the overall financial condition of the bank; and the level of other risks at the bank for which capital is needed.
At December 31, 2018, the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements currently applicable. The following table presents the Bank’s capital position at December 31, 2018:

 | | | | | | | Capital 
As of December 31, 2018 | ActualCapital | | RequiredCapital | | ExcessAmount | | ActualPercent | RequiredPercent |

Prompt Corrective Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that the Federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The FDIC’s regulations define the five categories as follows:
An institution is classified as “well capitalized” if:

• | its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 5%, and it is not subject to any order or directive by the FDIC to meet a specific capital level; and


• | its ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 6.5%; and


• | its ratio to Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 8%; and


• | its ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 10%.

An institution is classified as “adequately capitalized” if:

• | its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 4%; and


• | its ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 6.375%; and


• | its ratio to Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 7.875%; and


• | its ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 9.875%.

An institution is classified as “undercapitalized” if:

• | its leverage ratio is less than 4%; and


• | its ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is less than 6.375%; and


• | its ratio to Tier 1 risk based capital is at less than 7.875%; and


• | its ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 9.875%.

An institution is classified as “significantly undercapitalized” if:

• | its leverage ratio is less than 3%; or

20


• | its ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is less than 4.875%; or


• | its ratio to Tier 1 risk based capital is at less than 5.875%; or


• | its total risk-based capital is less than 7.875%.

An institution that has a tangible capital to total assets ratio equal to or less than 2% is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized.”
The FDIC is required, with some exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured bank if that bank is “critically undercapitalized.” The FDIC may also appoint a conservator or receiver for a state bank on the basis of the institution’s financial condition or upon the occurrence of certain events, including:

• | insolvency, or when the assets of the bank are less than its liabilities to depositors and others;


• | substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices;


• | existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business;


• | likelihood that the bank will be unable to meet the demands of its depositors or to pay its obligations in the normal course of business; and


• | insufficient capital, or the incurring or likely incurring of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution’s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment of capital without Federal assistance.

Based on the regulatory guidelines, the Bank satisfies the criteria to be “well-capitalized.” 
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Deposit accounts at the Bank are insured by the DIF of the FDIC. The Bank is therefore subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments which are determined using a risk-based system.
In 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule required by the Dodd-Frank Act, that changed the assessment base from domestic deposits to average assets minus average tangible equity, adopted a new large-bank pricing assessment scheme, and set a target size for the DIF. The rule finalized a target size for the DIF at 2% of insured deposits. It also implemented a lower assessment rate schedule when the fund reaches 1.15% (so that the average rate over time should be about 8.5 basis points) and, in lieu of dividends, provided for a lower rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 2% and 2.5%. The rule lowered overall assessment rates in order to generate the same approximate amount of revenue under the new larger base as was raised under the old base. The assessment rates in total are between 2.5 and 9 basis points on the broader base for banks in the lowest risk category, and 30 to 45 basis points for banks in the highest risk category. Deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor.
The FDIC may terminate the insurance of an institution’s deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The management of the Bank does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.
In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”), formed in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, is authorized to impose and collect, through the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019.
The total expense incurred in 2018 and 2017 for the deposit insurance assessment and the FICO payments were $2.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively.
Loans to One Borrower. Subject to certain exceptions, a banking institution may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of its unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if secured by specified readily-marketable collateral. 
Limitation on Capital Distributions. Applicable regulations impose limitations upon all capital distributions by a banking institution, including cash dividends, payments to repurchase its shares and payments to stockholders of another institution in a cash-out merger. Under the regulations, an application to and the approval of the OCC, is required prior to any capital distribution if the total capital distributions for the calendar year exceeds net income for that year plus the amount of retained net income for the preceding two years, the institution would be undercapitalized following the distribution or the distribution would otherwise be contrary to a statute, regulation or agreement with the OCC. In the event the Bank’s capital fell below its regulatory requirements or the FRB or OCC notified it that it was in need of more than normal supervision, the Bank’s ability to make capital distributions could be restricted. In addition, the FRB or OCC could prohibit a proposed capital distribution by any institution, which would otherwise be permitted by the regulation, if the FRB or OCC determine that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. If the Bank is unable for any reason to pay a dividend to the Company, the Company may not have the liquidity necessary to pay a dividend in the future, pay a dividend at the same rate as historically paid, be able to repurchase stock, or to meet current debt obligations. In

addition, capital requirements made applicable to the Company as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III may limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock in the future.
Assessments. Banking institutions are required to pay assessments to fund regulatory operations. The assessments, paid on a semi-annual basis, are based upon the institution’s total assets, including consolidated subsidiaries as reported in the Bank’s latest quarterly regulatory report, as well as the institution’s regulatory rating and complexity component. The assessments paid by the Bank for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 totaled $1.3 million and $923,000, respectively.
Transactions with Related Parties. The Bank’s authority to engage in transactions with “affiliates” (e.g., any company that controls or is under common control with an institution, including the Company and its non-bank subsidiaries) is limited by Federal law. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate is limited to 10% of the capital and surplus of the bank. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the bank’s capital and surplus. Certain transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type described in Federal law. The purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. The transactions with affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances, that are at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. In addition, banks are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no bank may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary.
Federal Home Loan Bank System
The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional FHLBs. Each FHLB provides member institutions with a central credit facility. The Bank, as a member of the FHLB-NY is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in that FHLB in an amount at least equal to 0.20% of mortgage-related assets and 4.5% of the specified value of certain transactions with the FHLB. The Bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in FHLB-NY stock at December 31, 2018 of $28.8 million.
Federal Reserve System
The Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily interest-bearing checking and regular checking accounts). The regulations generally provide that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: a 3% reserve ratio is assessed on net transaction accounts up to and including $122.3 million; a 10% reserve ratio is applied above $122.3 million. The first $16.0 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the FRB) are exempt from the reserve requirements. The amounts are adjusted annually. The Bank complies with the foregoing requirements. For 2019, the FRB has set the 3% reserve limit at $124.2 million and the exemption at $16.3 million.
In addition, as a national bank, the Bank is required to hold capital stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The required shares may be adjusted up or down based on changes to the Bank's common stock and paid-in surplus. The Bank is in compliance with these requirements, with a total investment in Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia stock of $28.0 million at December 31, 2018. 
FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION
Federal Taxation
General. The Company and the Bank report their income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting, and are subject to Federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly the Bank’s reserve for bad debts. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Bank or the Company. 
Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. For tax years before December 31, 2017, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) imposed a tax on alternative minimum taxable income (“AMTI”) at a rate of 20%. Only 90% of AMTI can be offset by net operating loss carryovers. AMTI is increased by an amount equal to 75% of the amount by which the Bank’s adjusted current earnings exceeds its AMTI (determined without regard to this preference and prior to reduction for net operating losses). On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”) was enacted resulting in significant modifications to existing laws, including elimination of the corporate alternative tax. 
Dividends Received Deduction and Other Matters. The Company may exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. The corporate dividends received deduction is generally 70% in the case of dividends received from unaffiliated corporations with which the Company and the Bank will not file a consolidated tax return, except that if the Company or the Bank own more than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend then 80% of any dividends received may be deducted.

Tax Reform. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”) was enacted resulting in significant modifications to existing law, including a reduction in the statutory rate from 35% in 2017, to 21% in 2018. As a result of the Tax Reform, the Company was required to revalue its deferred tax asset, resulting in a tax benefit of $1.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2018, and a tax expense of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
State and Local Taxation
New Jersey Taxation. The Bank files New Jersey income tax returns. For New Jersey income tax purposes, the Bank is subject to a tax rate of 9% of taxable income. For this purpose, “taxable income” generally means Federal taxable income, subject to certain adjustments (including addition of interest income on state and municipal obligations).
The Company is required to file a New Jersey income tax return because it does business in New Jersey. For New Jersey tax purposes, regular corporations are presently taxed at a rate equal to 9% of taxable income. New Jersey also imposes a temporary surtax of 2.5% for 2018 and 2019, and 1.5% for 2020 and 2021. For calendar year-end corporations prior to 2019, if the Company meets certain requirements, it was eligible to elect to be taxed as a New Jersey Investment Company at a tax rate presently equal to 3.60% (40% of 9%) of taxable income. The Company did not qualify as a New Jersey Investment Company. In addition, recent changes to New Jersey law require combined filing for members of an affiliated group for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2019, changing New Jersey’s current status as a separate return state. This change may increase the Company’s New Jersey state tax expense in future periods.
OceanFirst REIT Holdings, Inc. files a New Jersey income tax return and qualifies as a New Jersey Investment Company which is taxed at a rate presently equal to 3.60% of taxable income.
New York Taxation. Due to an increase in loan activity both organically and through acquisition, the Bank is required to file a New York State and MTA tax return. The New York return requires consolidation of all entities, including OceanFirst Realty, and New York taxable income, consistent with other states, generally means Federal taxable income subject to certain adjustments. The allocation and apportionment of taxable income to New York state may positively affect the overall tax rate.
Delaware Taxation. As a Delaware holding company not earning income in Delaware, the Company is exempted from Delaware corporate income tax but is required to file an annual report with and pay an annual franchise tax to the State of Delaware.
