 As used in this annual report on Form 10-K, the terms we, us our, the Company and Alkaline refer to The Alkaline Water Company Inc., a Nevada corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries A88 Infused Beverage Division, Inc. (a Nevada Corporation hereinafter referred to as A88 Infused), A88 International, Inc. (a Nevada Corporation), and Alkaline 88, LLC (an Arizona Limited Liability Company), unless otherwise specified. 
 Corporate Overview
We offer retail consumers bottled alkaline water in 500-milliliter, 700-milliliter, 1-liter, 1.5 -liter, 3-liter and 1-gallon sizes under the trade name Alkaline88®. Our product is produced through an electrolysis process that uses specialized electronic cells coated with a variety of rare earth minerals to produce our 8.8 pH drinking water without the use of any manmade chemicals. Our product also incorporates 84 trace minerals from Himalayan pink rock salt. Our product is designed to have a clean smooth taste using only purified water and the Himalayan pink rock salt. We believe consumers drink our water because of the taste profile and the preconceived health benefits (although we do not market our products as having any potential health benefits), as well as because of our brand and trademark, which we believe is one of the most easily identifiable in the category. Measured by sales volume in 2018, we believe we are now one of the largest alkaline water companies in the United States.

Our product is presently available in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, although over 50% of our current sales are concentrated in the Southwest and Texas. We distribute our product through several channels. We sell through large national distributors, including UNFI, KeHE, C&S, and Core-Mark. We also sell our product to retail clients, including convenience stores, natural food products stores, large ethnic markets and national retailers. Examples of our retail clients include Walmart, Food Lion, Albertsons, Safeway, Kroger, Schnucks, Smart & Final, Jewel-Osco, Sprouts, Bashas, Stater Bros. Markets, Unified Grocers, Bristol Farms, Publix, Vallarta, Superior Foods, Ingles, HEB and Brookshires. The majority of our sales to retail clients are through brokers and distributors, however, sales to our larger retail clients are often direct to the clients own warehouse distribution network. 
 Our operating subsidiary, Alkaline 88, LLC, operates primarily as a marketing, distribution, and manufacturing company. It has entered into co-packing agreements with eight different bottling companies located in Virginia, Georgia, California, Texas, Nevada and Arizona to act as co-packers for our product. Our current capacity at all plants exceeds approximately $8.3 million per month wholesale. 
 Our component materials are readily available through multiple vendors. Our principal suppliers are Vav Plastics Inc., Amcor Inc. and Packaging Corporation of America.
 A88 Infused Beverage Division, Inc.
In August 2018, we formed A88 Infused Beverage Division, Inc., or A88 Infused, a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company. A88 Infused's focus is brand extension and product innovations in the wellness water category. We formed A88 Infused to meet what we believe is increasing consumer demand for enhanced and functional (value-added) beverages. We expect A88 Infused to capitalize on this and potential consumer demand with the development and launch of new products focused on growing trends in the beverage space. 
 To prepare for the launch of products by A88 Infused, we have expanded our packaging capabilities. We announced in January, 2019 that Nevada-based Western Group Packing has agreed to produce A88 Infused's flavored Alkaline88® water products and its planned hemp extract-infused water product at its 150,000+ square foot facility located in North Las Vegas, NV. We have received verbal confirmation from many of our current retail clients of their interest in purchasing our flavored Alkaline88®waters. The production of A88 Infused's planned hemp extract product is contingent on U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, and state laws, regulations, and guidance. While the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 removed hemp from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, the law did not change the FDA's authorities with respect to food or drugs. As of June 28, 2019, the FDA has not made a determination that the use of hemp extract in food is safe.The FDA has evaluated Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) notices for three hemp seed-derived food ingredients and determined that the agency has no questions that those ingredients are GRAS under their intended conditions of use. 
 In early February 2019, at the Convenience EPPS trade show in Chicago, Illinois and in May, 2019 at the Western Association of Food Chains Convention, we sampled and offered up for sale "Alkaline88® Flavored," which is available in four different, all natural, sugar-free flavors. We believe "Alkaline88® Flavored" is the first flavored bottled alkaline water to be sold in the United States. 
 A88 Infused is also developing and preparing for the initial launch of its planned hemp extract product, which will be marketed under the trademark Soothe. In the event the FDA issues appropriate regulations or guidance or determines that it has no questions that hemp extract is GRAS under intended conditions of use that would permit A88 Infused to market hemp extract in water without food additive approval, we expect to produce and sell Soothe as still water in bottles. We may also decide to market Soothe in any states, districts or territories if applicable laws allow for such sale or if a supplier meets and complies with the FDA's GRAS regulations with respect to a self-certification regarding the safety and GRAS status of the use of hemp extract. We expect to produce Soothe as a low calorie or no calorie, hemp extract-infused water in three flavors. We may change the composition of our planned hemp-extract-infused product as necessary to comply with federal, state or local laws, regulations or guidance.
 We intend to comply in full with all federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations as we develop our hemp extract alkaline water and other product lines. We will not pursue the production or sale of hemp extract-infused products until legally permitted.

Plan of Operations
In order for us to implement our business plan over the next 12 months, we have identified the following milestones that we expect to achieve:
 

Expansion of Broker Network  We expect to continue to develop our
 working relationship with our national broker network. We continually meet,
 train, and go on sales call with our national broker network in order to take
 advantage of the momentum currently being created by their efforts. We
 anticipate a considerable amount of travel and ongoing expenses to be incurred
 as part of this expansion. 

Increase Manufacturing Capacity  (i) Flagship Alkaline88 product:
 we expect to add one to two new co-packer facilities, strategically located to
 reduce freight costs and meet current volumes and future growth objectives;
 and (ii) A88 Infused: we expect to add three to five new co-packer facilities
 strategically located to meet anticipated volumes by product type and future
 growth objectives. 

Expand Retail Distribution  We continue to expand our retail
 presence. 

Addition of Support Staff  In order to support expansion efforts
 and to continue the training and support of our broker network, we anticipate
 that we will need to hire approximately four more people on the corporate
 level for the specific purpose of supporting the broker, distributor and
 retailers and their logistical and accounting requirements. We continue to
 seek and interview candidates to fill our growing need for additional
 staffing. 

Capital Considerations  Our business plan can be adjusted based on
 the available capital to the business. In March, 2019, we raised net proceeds
 of $10,450,900 via a public offering of our common stock. We believe the
 proceeds from this offering, plus anticipated warrant exercises (we have
 received $1,180,486 from warrant exercises since March 31, 2019) will
 adequately fund our operations and capital needs for the next 12 months.
 
 The milestones set forth above reflect our current judgment and belief regarding the direction of our business. Actual events, expenditures and results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections or assumptions suggested herein. 
 If our own financial resources and future cash-flows from operations are insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness will result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that could restrict our operations or modify our plans to grow the business. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, will limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects. 
 Distribution Method for Our Products
Our distribution network is a broker-distributor-retailer network, whereby brokers represent our products to distributors and retailers. Our target retail markets are: (a) chain and independent health food stores; (b) grocery stores; (c) convenience stores; (d) drug stores; and (e) the mass retail market. We have recently gained broker representation through Advantage Solutions for the continued expansion into our target retail markets. 
 We have distribution agreements with large national distributors (UNFI, KeHe, CoreMark, and C&S), representing over 150,000 retail establishments. Our current retailers include convenience stores, natural food products stores, large ethnic markets and national retailers. Currently, we sell all of our products to our retailers through brokers and distributors. Our larger retail clients bring the water in through their own warehouse distribution network. Our current retail clients are made up of a variety of the following; convenience stores, including 7-11s; large national retailers, including Walmart, CVS, Albertsons/Safeway, Kroger companies, and regional grocery chains such as Schnucks, Smart & Final, Jewel-Osco, Sprouts, Bashas, Bristol Farms, Stater Brothers, Publix, Vallarta, Superior Foods, Brookshires, HEB and other companies throughout the United States. In total we are now in more than half of the top 75 grocery retailers in the United States. 
 We have engaged a producer of private labeled bottled water to assist in the manufacturing, procurement and logistical aspects of our business. Their specialized water production capabilities are expected to allow us to support the growing demand for our products. We believe this arrangement will enable us to further scale production and distribution as the Alkaline88®brand continues to gain market share.

Dependence on Few Customers
We have 2 major customers that together account for 46% (28% and 18%, respectively) of accounts receivable at March 31, 2019, and 2 customers that together account for 43% (25% and 18%, respectively) of the total revenues earned for the year ended March 31, 2019. 
 There can be no assurance that such customers will continue to order our products in the same level or at all. A reduction or delay in orders from such customers, including reductions or delays due to market, economic or competitive conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 Marketing
We intend to continue to market our product through our broker network and to avail ourselves to the promotional activities of other companies and competitors regarding the benefits of alkaline water. We anticipate that our initial marketing thrust will be to support the retailers and distribution network with point of sales displays and other marketing materials, strategically adding an extensive public relations program and other marketing as the markets dictate. 
 We have engaged a business and marketing consulting firm and sales broker to assist our company in all aspects of our marketing, trade promotion, public relations and brand development. Their expertise in all aspects of consumer goods brand development, marketing and promotional programs is expected to help us meet the growing consumer demand for both our flagship Alkaline88® product and our upcoming A88 Infused product line. We have also engaged a sales and merchandising broker to implement a unique Van Program (where sales representatives sell products directly from vans to the retailers) throughout Texas and California which is intended to bring both our flagship Alkaline88® products and, once launched, A88 Infuseds products to over 13,000 independently owned convenience stores in those markets. We expect to be able to expand the program to an additional nine US markets over the next few years.
 Competition
The commercial retail beverage industry, and in particular its non-alcoholic beverage segment, is highly competitive. Market participants are of various sizes, with various market shares and geographical reach, some of whom have access to substantially more sources of capital. 
 We compete generally with all liquid refreshments, including bottled water and numerous specialty beverages, such as: CORE® Hydration, SOBE®, Snapple®, AriZona® Iced Tea, Vitaminwater®, Gatorade Perform®, and POWERADE®. 
 We compete indirectly with major international beverage companies including but not limited to: The Coca-Cola Company®, PepsiCo, Inc., The Nestlé Group, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc, Danone S.A., The Kraft Heinz Company, and Unilever PLC. These companies have established market presence in the United States and globally, and offer a variety of beverages that are competitors to our products. We face potential direct competition from such companies, because they have the financial resources, and access to manufacturing and distribution channels to rapidly enter the alkaline water market. 
 We will compete directly with other alkaline water producers and brands focused on the emerging alkaline beverage market including Eternal, Essentia, Core, Icelandic, Real Water, Aqua Hydrate, Mountain Valley, Qure, Penta, and Alka Power. Products offered by our direct competitors are sold in various volumes and prices with prices ranging from approximately $0.99 for a half-liter bottle to $4.99 for a one-gallon bottle, and volumes ranging from half-liter bottles to one-gallon bottles. We currently offer our product in a one-gallon bottle for a suggested resale price or an SRP of $4.99, three-liter bottle for an SRP of $3.99, 1.5 liter at an SRP of $2.49, 1 liter at an SRP of $1.99, 700 milliliter single serving at an SRP of $1.19, and a 500 milliliter at an SRP of $0.99. Our competitors may introduce larger sizes and offer them at an SRP that is lower than our products. We can provide no assurances that consumers will continue to purchase our products or that they will not prefer to purchase a competitive product.

Intellectual Property
Where available, we intend to obtain trademark protection in the United States for a number of trademarks for slogans and product designs. We intend to aggressively assert our rights under trade secret, unfair competition, trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property, including product design, product research and concepts and recognized trademarks. These rights are protected through the acquisition of patents and trademark registrations, the maintenance of trade secrets, the development of trade dress, and, where appropriate, litigation against those who are, in our opinion, infringing these rights. The trademark for Alkaline88® has been registered in the USA, Canada, Hong Kong, and has been applied for in China. 
 While there can be no assurance that registered trademarks will protect our proprietary information, we intend to assert our intellectual property rights against any infringer. Although any assertion of our rights could result in a substantial cost to, and diversion of effort by, our company, management believes that the protection of our intellectual property rights will be a key component of our sales and operating strategy. 
 The electrolysis process through which our product is produced is proprietary to us and, while the process is not patented, we seek to protect the process through the maintenance of trade secrets and know-how agreements. 
 Seasonality of Business
The sales of our products are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for our product and contribute to lower sales, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods. 
 Government Regulation
The advertising, distribution, labeling, production, safety, sale, and transportation in the United States of our product will be subject to: the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws; competition laws; federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. 
 Legal requirements apply in many jurisdictions in the United States requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing, and use of certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary and are constantly evolving. Other types of statutes and regulations relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, ecotaxes and/or product stewardship also apply in various jurisdictions in the United States. We anticipate that additional, similar legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at the local, state and federal levels in the United States. 
 Any third-party bottling facility that we may choose to utilize in the future and any other such operations will be subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. It will be our policy to comply with any and all such legal requirements. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position. 
 Employees
In addition to Richard Wright, who is our president, chief executive officer and director, David Guarino, who is our chief financial officer, secretary, treasurer and director, and Ronald DaVella, our executive vice president of finance, we currently employ 14 full time employees and 3 part-time employee. We also work with retail brokers in the United States who are paid on a contract basis. Our operations are overseen directly by management that engages our employees to carry on our business. Our management oversees all responsibilities in the areas of corporate administration, business development, and research. We intend to expand our current management to retain skilled directors, officers, and employees with experience relevant to our business focus. Our managements relationships with manufacturers, distillers, development/research companies, bottling concerns, and certain retail customers will provide the foundation through which we expect to grow our business in the future. We believe that the skill-set of our management team will be a primary asset in the development of our brands and trademarks. We also plan to form an independent network of contract sales and regional managers, a promotional support team, and several market segment specialists who will be paid on a variable basis.
