 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview
 We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel treatments for orphan endocrine diseases where current therapies do not exist or are insufficient. The endocrine system is a collection of glands that secrete hormones into the blood stream to regulate a number of functions, including appetite, metabolism, growth, development and reproduction. Diseases of the endocrine system can cause multiple and varied symptoms, including appetite dysregulation, metabolic dysfunction, obesity, cardiovascular disease, menstrual irregularity, hirsutism, and infertility. 
 We are currently advancing two product candidates to treat three indications. Our most advanced product candidate, livoletide (AZP-531), is a potential treatment for Prader-Willi syndrome, or PWS, a rare and complex genetic endocrine disease characterized by hyperphagia, or insatiable hunger, that contributes to serious complications, a significant burden on patients and caregivers and early mortality. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial in 47 patients with PWS, we observed that administration of livoletide once daily was associated with a clinically meaningful improvement in hyperphagia, as well as a reduction in appetite. In a pre-specified analysis of 38 home-resident PWS patients from the Phase 2 trial, we observed a larger and statistically significant decrease in hyperphagia following administration of livoletide as compared to placebo. In March 2019, we announced that we initiated a pivotal Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of livoletide in PWS patients, with topline results from the Phase 2b portion of the study expected in the first half of 2020. 
 We are also developing nevanimibe (ATR-101) with a primary focus on treating patients with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or CAH, a rare, monogenic adrenal disease that requires lifelong treatment with exogenous cortisol, often at high doses. These chronic high doses of cortisol can result in side effects that include diabetes, obesity, hypertension and psychological problems. When on suboptimal doses of cortisol, female CAH patients can experience hirsutism, infertility and menstrual irregularity, and male CAH patients can experience infertility and testicular tumors, making it difficult for physicians to appropriately treat CAH without causing adverse consequences. We reported results from our Phase 2 clinical trial of nevanimibe in patients with CAH in March 2018 and initiated a Phase 2b trial in the third quarter of 2018, with results expected in the first half of 2020. We are also investigating nevanimibe in a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, or CS, a rare endocrine disease characterized by excessive cortisol production from the adrenal glands. 
 Merger
 On December 7, 2018, OvaScience, Inc., or OvaScience, now known as Millendo Therapeutics, Inc., completed its reverse merger or, the Merger, with what was then known as “Millendo Therapeutics, Inc.,” or Private Millendo, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated as of August 8, 2018, as amended on September 25, 2018 and November 1, 2018.  OvaScience’s shares of common stock listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, previously trading through the close of business on Friday, December 7, 2018 under the ticker symbol “OVAS,” commenced trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market, under the ticker symbol “MLND,” on Monday, December 10, 2018.
 Immediately following the Merger, Private Millendo became a wholly-owned subsidiary of OvaScience.  Upon consummation of the Merger, OvaScience adopted the business plan of Private Millendo and discontinued the pursuit of OvaScience’s business plan pre-Closing.  
 Livoletide (AZP-531) for the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)
 We are developing livoletide for the treatment of patients with PWS, a rare and complex genetic endocrine disease affecting appetite, growth, metabolism, cognitive function and behavior. Recognized as the most common genetic cause of life-threatening childhood obesity, PWS is estimated to affect between 8,000-11,000 patients in the 

 
  4

 
United States and 13,000-18,000 in Europe. While PWS patients experience a multitude of symptoms, hyperphagia, which typically begins in early childhood, is among the most serious. When coupled with the low resting energy expenditures that also characterize PWS, hyperphagia leads to significant weight gain and obesity. Mortality occurs early in PWS patients, with death often occurring between the ages of 30 and 40 from respiratory distress, cardiovascular events and accidents, most resulting from complications associated with hyperphagia. There are currently no approved treatments for hyperphagia or the abnormal eating behaviors associated with PWS. Managing hyperphagia requires security measures to prevent access to food in cupboards, refrigerators and garbage, placing a significant burden on patients and their caregivers, often parents. While growth hormone is used in a majority of PWS patients to help optimize adult height, cognition and body composition, it has shown no convincing evidence to date that it affects hyperphagia. 
 We believe that livoletide, a cyclic peptide analogue of unacylated ghrelin, or UAG, may provide a unique approach for the treatment of PWS by addressing the underlying hormone dysregulation that causes the disease. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial in 47 patients with PWS, we observed that administration of livoletide once daily was associated with a clinically meaningful improvement in hyperphagia, as assessed by the PWS Hyperphagia Questionnaire, as well as a reduction in appetite. In a pre-specified analysis of 38 home-resident PWS patients from the Phase 2 trial, we observed a larger and statistically significant decrease in hyperphagia following administration of livoletide as compared to placebo. Based on clinical and preclinical data, we believe livoletide has the potential to decrease hyperphagia and negative food-related behaviors, with potential long-term benefits with respect to obesity and its complications. We announced in March 2019 that we initiated a pivotal Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of livoletide for the treatment of PWS patients, with topline results from the Phase 2b portion of the study expected in the first half of 2020. 
 We acquired livoletide in connection with our acquisition of Alizé Pharma SAS, or Alizé, in December 2017. We have received orphan drug designation for livoletide from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for the treatment of PWS. As of December 31, 2018, we owned four issued U.S. patents with respect to livoletide, the earliest of which is not due to expire before 2028 and the latest of which is not due to expire before 2033 without extension pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act.
 Nevanimibe for the treatment of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and endogenous Cushing’s syndrome (CS)

We are primarily focused on developing nevanimibe for the treatment of patients with CAH, a rare, monogenic adrenal disease. CAH is diagnosed at birth through universal screening, occurs in approximately one in 15,000 live births in the United States and is characterized by an inability of the body to produce cortisol naturally. CAH patients require lifelong treatment with exogenous cortisol, often at high doses, which can result in side effects that include diabetes, obesity, hypertension and psychological problems. Conversely, in the absence of suppressive cortisol levels, excess steroid precursors and androgens are generated and can result in hirsutism, infertility and menstrual irregularity in female CAH patients, and testicular atrophy and infertility in male CAH patients. In addition, as many as half of male CAH patients develop large testicular tumors. 
 We believe that nevanimibe, a potentially first-in-class acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase 1, or ACAT1, inhibitor represents a novel, adrenal-specific approach to treating CAH that will minimize the need to administer chronic high doses of exogenous cortisol. ACAT1 is a critical enzyme involved in adrenal steroid synthesis and, by inhibiting ACAT1, nevanimibe seeks to suppress the hormonal process that ultimately leads to the production of excess steroid precursors, particularly 17-hydroxyprogesterone, or 17-OHP, and androgens in CAH patients. In a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial of nevanimibe for the treatment of patients with CAH, we observed nevanimibe to be associated with clear signs of clinical activity in seven of 10 treated patients, as well as to have rapid onset of action. In this trial, we further observed that during treatment with nevanimibe at all doses, patients exhibited a mean reduction in levels of 17-OHP, the key biomarker used by physicians to guide patient treatment, while during administration of placebo, patients exhibited a mean increase in 17-OHP levels. Seventy percent of subjects experienced a decrease in 17-OHP of at least 50% during at least one nevanimibe treatment period. We initiated a Phase 2b clinical trial of nevanimibe in CAH patients in the third quarter of 2018, with results expected in the first half of 2020.

 We are also pursuing development of nevanimibe for the treatment of patients with CS, a rare endocrine disease characterized by excessive cortisol production from the adrenal glands and associated with weight gain, hypertension, diabetes, bone loss, cognitive impairment, mood disorders and a range of neurologic symptoms. We estimate that CS affects approximately 20,000 people in the United States. We are currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial of nevanimibe for the treatment of patients with CS. 
 We have received orphan drug designation for nevanimibe from the FDA for the treatment of CAH and CS, as well as from the EMA for the treatment of CAH. As of December 31, 2018, we owned two issued U.S. patents with respect to nevanimibe, which are not due to expire before 2035, and we jointly owned, with University of Michigan, three issued U.S. patents, which are each not due to expire before 2033.

 Strategy
 We are a leading endocrine company that creates distinct and transformative treatments for a wide range of endocrine diseases where there is significant unmet medical need. Key elements of our strategy are as follows:
· | Rapidly and efficiently advance development of, obtain approval for, and commercialize livoletide for the treatment of PWS. Building on our Phase 2 trial results, we believe livoletide may provide a unique, first-in-class treatment approach to address hyperphagia in PWS patients, the key concern for those with this disease and their caregivers, and where we believe there is a significant unmet medical need. We initiated a pivotal Phase 2b/3 clinical trial in PWS patients in March 2019, with topline results from the Phase 2b portion of the study expected in the first half of 2020. If this trial is successful, we plan to pursue registration of livoletide for the treatment of PWS.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pursue development of, obtain approval for, and commercialize nevanimibe for the treatment of two orphan adrenal indications-CAH and CS. We believe nevanimibe, working through a novel mechanism of action, may allow CAH patients to obtain therapeutic benefit from exogenous cortisol at lower and better-tolerated doses. In so doing, nevanimibe may enable physicians to effectively treat the disease with lower doses of exogenous cortisol, thereby reducing the effects of long-term high doses of exogenous cortisol, while simultaneously preventing androgen excess. We reported results from our Phase 2 clinical trial of nevanimibe in CAH patients in March 2018 and initiated a Phase 2b clinical trial in the third quarter of

2018, with results expected in the first half of 2020. We have also initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of nevanimibe for the treatment of CS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to expand our pipeline by leveraging our expertise in in-licensing and acquiring product candidates. We have a strong track record of licensing or acquiring novel programs to build the current pipeline and we plan to strategically pursue licensing or acquisition of novel therapeutic opportunities that complement our existing portfolio. We believe that there are many opportunities to leverage our deep endocrine expertise to develop new treatments for endocrine diseases with significant unmet medical needs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Build a specialized sales and marketing organization in the United States targeting endocrinologists. If approved by the FDA, we plan to commercialize both of our current endocrine product candidates in the United States ourselves. As we advance livoletide and nevanimibe through clinical development, we plan to grow our commercial organization in support of anticipated product launches.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maximize the value of our portfolio by strategically collaborating in selected markets. We currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights with respect to both of our product candidates. We plan to strategically consider collaboration or partnering opportunities in markets outside of the United States. We believe our strategy will allow us to efficiently allocate resources to maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates, if approved.

  Product Candidates
 Livoletide (AZP-531) for the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)
 Background
 PWS is a rare endocrine disease caused by a spontaneous genetic error that results in lack of expression of several genes on chromosome 15 and is characterized by hyperphagia, intellectual disability, short stature and incomplete sexual development. Recognized as the most common genetic cause of life-threatening childhood obesity, PWS occurs in approximately one in 15,000 births, with an estimated prevalence of 8,000 to 11,000 patients in the United States and 13,000 to 18,000 patients in Europe.
 During infancy, PWS patients often have low muscle tone, or hypotonia, and failure to thrive, which leads to early diagnosis. Early in childhood, appetite and interest in food start to increase and, by approximately five to eight years of age, patients experience an increase in hyperphagia. PWS patients typically display aggressive and obsessive food-seeking behaviors, including food storage, foraging and hoarding, all of which represent a lifelong source of distress and severely affect social adaptation, occupational performance and quality of life. In addition, hyperphagia in PWS patients is associated with significant morbidity, including weight gain and obesity often exacerbated by the low resting energy expenditure levels that characterize the disease, type 2 diabetes and related complications, stomach rupture and choking. More than half of adult PWS patients have a body mass index over 40 and one quarter of adult PWS patients have type 2 diabetes. Mortality occurs early in PWS patients, with death often occurring between the ages of 30 and 40 from respiratory distress, cardiovascular events and accidents, most resulting from complications of hyperphagia.
 Most PWS patients are unable to live independently or work and require constant supervision and care. Managing hyperphagia requires security measures to prevent access to food in cupboards, refrigerators and garbage, placing a significant burden on patients and their caregivers, often parents. Caregivers often struggle to control the aggressive food-seeking behavior of the PWS patients under their care, especially as patients age and gain weight as a result of the disease. According to the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research, 74% of caregivers identified reduced hyperphagia as the most desirable feature they would look for in an ideal PWS treatment, absent a cure. This struggle with food is compounded by the fact that a significant majority of PWS patients suffer from some form of intellectual or emotional disability, resulting in some PWS patients ultimately being transferred to a structured setting. There are currently no approved treatments for hyperphagia or the abnormal eating behaviors associated with PWS. While growth

hormone is used in a majority of PWS patients to help optimize adult height, cognition and body composition, it has no effect on hyperphagia.
 While the basis for the abnormal eating behavior in PWS patients is not yet fully understood, evidence suggests involvement of appetite hormone disturbances and dysfunction of the mechanisms of the central nervous system that regulate food intake. Acylated ghrelin, or AG, is the most potent known appetite-stimulating hormone and is commonly known as the “hunger hormone.” AG acts in the hypothalamus and plays a central role in the regulation of feeding and food seeking behavior. Signaling through the AG receptor, also known as the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, has been linked to many physiological functions, including appetite stimulation, lipid accumulation and insulin resistance. Historically, research has linked high total ghrelin concentrations (which includes AG, UAG and other peptide forms of ghrelin) to the hyperphagia and excessive eating that is characteristic of PWS. However, recent studies indicate that the ratio of AG to UAG is also elevated in PWS patients compared to aged-matched healthy subjects. UAG is a naturally occurring hormone associated with inhibition of AG-induced food intake, reduction of insulin levels and inhibition of adipose tissue deposition. UAG is also referred to as des-acyl ghrelin, or DAG. The observations from these recent studies suggest a potential role for UAG in negatively regulating hyperphagia.
 We believe that livoletide, a cyclic peptide analogue of UAG, may provide a unique, first-in-class approach for the treatment of hyperphagia in PWS patients by addressing the underlying hormone dysregulation causing the disease.
 Clinical development
 To date, our livoletide clinical program has included clinical trials with over 150 subjects, including in a Phase 1 clinical program with 44 healthy volunteers, 32 overweight or obese adults and 36 type 2 diabetes patients and in a Phase 2 clinical trial with 47 PWS patients. In these trials, livoletide was reported to be well tolerated at single doses of up to 120 µg/kg and multiple doses over 14 days of up to 60 µg/kg.
 Phase 2 trial
 Livoletide was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial conducted to study its effects in PWS. The trial enrolled 47 PWS patients and included both patients residing at home and at a single hospital-based clinical trial site. Patients residing at home were typically cared for by parents, while hospital staff generally cared for patients at the hospital-based site. All patients were administered either a 3 or 4 mg dose of livoletide (based on body weight), or placebo, subcutaneously once daily for 14 days. The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of livoletide over the course of two weeks. The main efficacy variable explored in the trial was changes in hyperphagia, as assessed using the PWS Hyperphagia Questionnaire, or HQ. The HQ is a disease-specific instrument that has been specifically designed and developed to capture food-related behaviors in PWS patients, as reported by caregivers. The FDA and EMA have accepted a nine-item version of the HQ as the primary endpoint in PWS clinical trials and this nine-item HQ is being used in our recently initiated pivotal Phase 2b/3 trial.
 In the trial, we observed a decrease in the total HQ score across all patients administered livoletide as compared to placebo (p=0.097). In a pre-specified analysis of 38 home-resident PWS patients from the Phase 2 trial, we observed a larger and statistically significant decrease in hyperphagia following administration of livoletide as compared to placebo (p=0.034). The analysis of home-resident patients excluded patients residing at the single hospital-based site, which provided a different treatment environment across a number of variables, including lack of consistency with respect to the party completing the HQ. We observed the largest treatment effect in a post-hoc analysis of 26 home-resident patients with baseline HQ scores of 10 or greater, which is reflective of the target patient population for our pivotal Phase 2b/3 trial. We believe that these changes in HQ scores reflect clinically meaningful changes in hyperphagic behaviors that affect patient and caregiver quality of life. The figure below shows the change in HQ scores relative to 

 
  8

 
baseline for patients treated with livoletide or placebo, respectively, across each of the three patient groups discussed above:

 A result is considered to be statistically significant when the probability of the result occurring by random chance, rather than from the efficacy of the treatment, is sufficiently low. The conventional method for measuring the statistical significance of a result is known as the “p-value,” which represents the probability that random chance caused the result (e.g., a p-value = 0.001 means that there is a 0.1% or less probability that the difference between the control group and the treatment group is purely due to random chance). Generally, a p-value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant, and may be supportive of a finding of efficacy by regulatory authorities. However, regulatory authorities, including the FDA and EMA, do not rely on strict statistical significance thresholds as criteria for marketing approval and maintain the flexibility to evaluate the overall risks and benefits of a treatment.
 We observed greater decreases in mean values in individual HQ item scores in the livoletide treatment group compared to placebo across each of nine individual questions in the HQ. We believe that improvements in just a few HQ items could have a profound effect on patients and caregivers, including reducing high-risk behaviors. The figure below shows the changes relative to baseline with respect to each of the nine individual items of the HQ in home-resident PWS patients treated with livoletide and placebo, respectively:

 Livoletide was reported to be well tolerated and no serious adverse events were observed. The overall number of reported adverse events were balanced between livoletide and placebo, with 60.9% of patients on livoletide and 58.3% of patients on placebo reporting adverse events. The most commonly reported adverse events in both groups were injection site reactions, which were generally mild and transient. There were no significant changes in vital signs or safety labs, nor were there any premature discontinuations from the trial due to side effects.
 Preclinical Development
 A comprehensive preclinical program for livoletide, including toxicology and pharmacology studies, has been conducted. 
 In one of a number of preclinical studies in rodents, administration of livoletide was associated with reduced AG-induced food intake. In rodent models of AG-induced food intake, rats receiving an intraperitoneal injection of AG exhibited significantly increased food intake within the first three hours post injection. Co-administration of AG with either UAG or livoletide was associated with inhibition of the stimulatory effect of AG on food uptake over this three-hour period. The figure below shows the observed effects of UAG and livoletide on AG-induced food uptake in rats:

 In longer term preclinical studies, overexpression of UAG from a transgene in mice was associated with significantly reduced food intake, fat pad mass, triglycerides and body weight at week 44 following commencement of dosing. These results are consistent with studies of shorter duration in which overexpression of UAG was associated with reduced mouse body weight beginning at age 16 weeks, as well as less development of white adipose tissue and better modulation of glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Administration of livoletide was associated with similar outcomes in a four-week preclinical study. 
 Based on clinical and preclinical data, we believe that administration of livoletide has the potential to increase functional UAG levels (level of UAG plus livoletide) and decrease hyperphagia and negative food-related behaviors in PWS patients, with potential long-term benefits with respect to obesity and its complications. 
 Clinical development plan 
 In March 2019, we announced that we initiated a pivotal Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of livoletide in PWS patients, which we often refer to as the ZEPHYR trial, with topline results from the Phase 2b portion of the study expected in the first half of 2020. 

 
  10

 

 We discussed the development strategy with both the FDA and EMA in advance of initiating the Phase 2b/3 study with livoletide. There was agreement with key elements of the development program:

· | Suitability of the validated 9-item PWS Hyperphagia Questionnaire (HQ-CT) for clinical trials survey as the primary efficacy endpoint for the study.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Phase 2b portion of our recently initiated Phase 2b/3 PWS trial may or may not be sufficient to support FDA approval depending on the data. Additionally, the FDA may require additional data (for example in children) in order to support an NDA approval in PWS in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The preference from the FDA to use fixed-exposure dosing (rather than fixed-dosing) given the wide range of body weights to be studied.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We expect that the Phase 2b portion of the randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial will enroll approximately 150 PWS patients at up to 40 sites in the United States and Europe. Patients will be administered one of two different doses of livoletide based on body weight or a placebo by once daily subcutaneous injection for three months. The primary endpoint of the trial will be an assessment of changes in hyperphagia based on the HQ-CT. Secondary endpoints include assessments of changes in total body fat mass, body mass index and body weight. Following completion of the three month placebo-controlled portion of the trial, patients will be eligible to enroll in a nine-month extension, which we anticipate will provide up to 12 months of safety and efficacy data. We believe that the three month placebo-controlled portion of the trial, if favorable, may be sufficient to support the filing of a New Drug Application, or NDA, in the U.S., or marketing authorization application in Europe, for livoletide for the treatment of PWS. 
 We expect that the Phase 3 portion of the clinical trial will enroll approximately 80 PWS patients at the same clinical sites. Patients who participated in the Phase 2b portion of the trial will not be eligible to participate in the Phase 3 portion of the trial. Patients will be administered a dose of livoletide (selected on the basis of the Phase 2b results) based on body weight, or a placebo, subcutaneously once daily for six months. The primary endpoint of the trial will be an assessment of changes in hyperphagia based on the HQ-CT. Secondary endpoints include assessments of changes in total body fat mass, body mass index and body weight, subject to change based on the outcome of the Phase 2b portion of the trial. Following completion of the six month placebo-controlled portion of the trial, patients will be eligible to enroll in a six-month extension. 
 Nevanimibe for the treatment of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)
 Background
 CAH is a rare, monogenic adrenal disease caused by patients’ inability to produce cortisol, which results in excessive production of steroid precursors and androgens, and requires lifelong treatment with exogenous cortisol. CAH occurs in approximately one in 15,000 live births in the United States and has a higher incidence in Europe, with an estimated prevalence of 15,000 to 18,000 patients in the United States and approximately 40,000 patients in Europe. CAH is diagnosed at birth through universal screening.
 The most frequent form of CAH, responsible for between 90% and 95% of cases, is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme 21-hydroxylase, which is required for the production of cortisol and other steroids in the adrenal cortex. As the hypothalamus and pituitary gland function normally in CAH patients, low or nonexistent cortisol levels stimulate the hypothalamus to produce and secrete an excess of corticotropin-releasing hormone, or CRH. Excess CRH stimulates cells in the pituitary gland to produce and secrete excess adrenocorticotropic hormone, or ACTH. In individuals without CAH, excess ACTH would lead to the over-synthesis of cortisol. However, in CAH patients, the lack of cortisol production results in increased levels of the adrenal steroid hormone precursors, including 17-OHP, with approximately 80% of CAH patients having 17-OHP levels outside of normal bounds. These excess precursors are diverted largely to the androgen pathway, resulting in elevated androgen levels, which leads to hirsutism, virilization, infertility and menstrual irregularity in women. In men, testicular tumors of adrenal gland origin are common.

 CAH requires treatment with exogenous cortisol, often at high doses, which both replaces the lack of endogenous cortisol and aims to suppress the hormonal processes that lead to excess CRH, ACTH and androgens. These chronic high doses of cortisol can result in side effects that include diabetes, obesity, hypertension and psychological problems, making it difficult for physicians to appropriately treat CAH without causing adverse consequences. Few CAH patients are able to achieve an optimal balance between exogenous cortisol dose and suppression of CRH, ACTH and androgens.
 Nevanimibe is an adrenal-selective inhibitor of ACAT1. ACAT1 is a critical enzyme that converts free cholesterol into cholesteryl esters in the adrenal glands. Cholesteryl esters are the reservoirs in which cholesterol is stored prior to its synthesis into adrenal steroids, including cortisol and androgens. By inhibiting ACAT1 in the adrenal glands, nevanimibe seeks to reduce the amount of cholesteryl esters and associated stored cholesterol available for synthesis into adrenal steroids thus reducing the levels of all adrenal steroids. By inhibiting ACAT1, we believe that nevanimibe represents a novel, adrenal-specific approach to treating CAH that will minimize the need to administer chronic high doses of exogenous cortisol to suppress the hormonal process that ultimately leads to the production of excess CRH, ACTH and androgens, including 17-OHP, in CAH patients.
 The graphic below depicts the mechanism of action of nevanimibe for the treatment of CAH:

 Clinical development 
 Phase 2 trial 
 We evaluated nevanimibe in a multicenter, single blind, intra-patient dose escalation Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of adult CAH. The trial’s objectives were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nevanimibe in this patient population.
 Following a two-week placebo lead-in period, eligible patients with baseline 17-OHP levels greater than or equal to four times the upper limit of normal, or ULN, received the lowest dose of nevanimibe for two weeks. This two-week treatment period was followed immediately by a single-blind placebo washout period of two weeks. If the primary outcome measure of reducing 17-OHP levels less than or equal to two times the ULN was not met, the patient was up-titrated to the next highest dose of nevanimibe. This process was repeated until the primary outcome measure was met or the patient reached the highest dose. A total of five nevanimibe dose levels were tested (125 mg BID, 250 mg BID, 500 mg BID, 750 mg BID and 1,000 mg BID). All patients remained on mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid replacement throughout the trial.

 
  12

 

 The trial enrolled 10 patients. The baseline 17-OHP levels of patients at screening ranged from seven to 187 times ULN, with a mean value of 52.5 times ULN. Nine patients completed the trial and one patient discontinued from the trial while on the highest dose level of nevanimibe due to a serious adverse event of enteritis.
 In the trial, we observed nevanimibe to be associated with clear signs of clinical activity in seven of 10 treated patients. We further observed that during treatment with nevanimibe at all doses, patients exhibited a mean reduction in levels of 17-OHP, while during administration of placebo, patients experienced a mean increase in 17-OHP levels. Two patients met the primary endpoint, with observed 17-OHP reductions to two times the ULN or less, and other patients had observed maximal decreases in 17-OHP of up to 72% during the two week treatment period. Overall, 70% of patients saw a 17-OHP reduction of 50% or more. During the placebo washout periods following each nevanimibe dose level, we observed that 17-OHP increased markedly, with no patients having a mean percentage decrease in 17-OHP. The bar graph below shows the change in the study population mean 17-OHP (ng/dL) values by study visit. Visits are numbered 1 to 13. Visit 1 was the screening visit and is not associated with a change in 17-OHP. The 17-OHP value presented at visit 2 shows the mean change in 17-OHP from visit 1 to the start of the single-blind, two week placebo lead-in period (visit 2). Visit 3 shows the change in 17-OHP that occurred from the start of the single-blind, two week placebo lead-in period (visit 2) to the end of that period (visit 3). We believe that the decrease in 17-OHP associated with visit 3 reflects increased compliance with concomitant medications. Visit 4 shows the decrease associated with administration of nevanimibe 125 mg BID, with the mean 17-OHP value at visit 3 serving as the baseline for the two-week nevanimibe 125 mg BID treatment period that ends at visit 4. Visit 5 shows the increase in 17-OHP associated with the two-week placebo washout period that immediately followed the nevanimibe 125 mg BID dosing period, with the mean 17-OHP value at visit 4 serving as the baseline for the two-week placebo period that ends at visit 5. Visits 5 and 6 (where nevanimibe, 250 mg BID was assessed), visits 7 and 8 (where nevanimibe 500 mg BID was assessed), visits 9 and 10 (where nevanimibe, 750 mg BID was assessed) and visits 11 and 12 (where nevanimibe 1000 mg BID was assessed) followed the same paradigm.
 Data with respect to one patient who completed the trial is excluded from the graphic below because that patient was administered high doses of exogenous cortisol in response to a serious adverse event (viral gastroenteritis), which would confound the results of the trial. In addition, one patient met the primary endpoint of the trial following visit 7 and therefore did not receive additional doses of nevanimibe. Accordingly, the graphics below includes data with respect to nine patients through visit seven and eight patients through all 13 visits.
 The graphic below illustrates the mean change in 17-OHP levels in patients at the indicated points in time.

 We believe the observed decreases in 17-OHP associated with each nevanimibe dose level and the corresponding observed increases in 17-OHP during the placebo wash-out periods demonstrate a treatment effect. We believe signs of clinical activity observed in seven of 10 patients, with two patients meeting the primary endpoint, provide sufficient evidence for the use of nevanimibe in the treatment of CAH to support further development. The primary efficacy endpoint assessed the percentage of patients meeting the primary outcome measure (17-OHP levels less than two times ULN); however the relatively small sample size and open-label, intra-subject dose escalation design of the trial precluded the use of formal statistical analyses (e.g., p-values) for either the primary efficacy endpoint or 

 
  13

 
secondary objectives, which included assessments of changes in levels of adrenal cortical steroids and steroid intermediates, changes in levels of ACTH and pharmacokinetics.
 Nevanimibe was reported to be well tolerated at all dose levels. Two serious adverse events were reported in the trial, both occurring in the same patient: one case of viral gastroenteritis, which was deemed not to be drug related, and one case of enteritis, which was deemed to be drug related. Both serious adverse events were treated with higher than usual doses of exogenous cortisol. The overall number of reported adverse events was balanced between nevanimibe and placebo. The most commonly reported adverse events in both groups were gastrointestinal disorders, nasopharyngitis and headaches, which were generally mild and transient. There were no observed dose-related trends in adverse events or safety laboratory results.
 Phase 1 trials
 We previously studied nevanimibe in a Phase 1 clinical trial in 63 patients with adrenocortical carcinoma across 14 dose-ranging cohorts. In the trial, we observed nevanimibe to be well tolerated at doses up to 158.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 12,000 mg/day for a 75 kg individual). The longest duration of treatment was 13 months (97.9 mg/kg/day). Forty-eight of the patients received a nevanimibe dose similar to or greater than the dose range in our Phase 2b CAH clinical trial.
 Preclinical development
 A comprehensive preclinical program for nevanimibe, including chronic toxicology and pharmacology studies, has been conducted.
 In one of a number of preclinical studies in dogs, we observed that administration of nevanimibe was associated with decreases in levels of adrenal steroids and steroid precursors. Nevanimibe was observed to be associated with dose and time-dependent decreases in basal and ACTH-stimulated levels of all adrenal steroids and steroid precursors tested after 14 days of treatment as shown in the figure below. Notably, both basal and ACTH-stimulated levels of 17-OHP were reduced by 100%.

 Clinical development plan
 We initiated a Phase 2b clinical trial of nevanimibe for the treatment of CAH in the third quarter of 2018, with results expected in the first half of 2020.
 We expect that the open-label, intra-subject dose-escalation trial will enroll a total of 20 to 24 CAH patients across approximately ten sites with either (1) 17-OHP levels greater than or equal to four times ULN or (2) 17-OHP levels less than four times ULN while on a high dose of exogenous cortisol. With respect to patients in the latter group, exogenous cortisol dosing will be reduced such that patients will have 17-OHP levels greater than or equal to four times ULN prior to administration of nevanimibe. Patients will receive nevanimibe for a total of 12 consecutive weeks starting at a dose of 1,000 mg BID. Dose escalation to 1,500 mg BID or 2,000 mg BID will be based on the primary outcome measure: 17-OHP levels. The primary endpoint will be an assessment of the percentage of patients that achieve 17-OHP levels less than or equal to two times ULN. Secondary endpoints include assessments of levels of other adrenal hormones, including androgens.
 Nevanimibe for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome (CS)
 CS is a rare endocrine disease characterized by excessive cortisol production from the adrenal glands. The chronic cortisol excess in CS can cause weight gain, hypertension, diabetes, bone loss and a range of neurologic symptoms. With chronic exposure to higher than normal levels of cortisol, patients may also exhibit cognitive impairment and mood disorders. The cumulative impact of these symptoms can significantly decrease both the quality of life and life expectancy of patients, with one study showing that CS patients have a comparable quality of life to patients suffering from cancer and multiple sclerosis. In some cases, untreated CS can be life-threatening. We estimate that CS affects approximately 20,000 people in the United States, with the medically managed target market being between 5,000 and 6,000 patients in the United States. CS most commonly affects people who are 20 to 50 years of age and women are affected three times more often than men.
 CS may be caused by benign pituitary, primary adrenal gland or non-adrenal cortisol secreting tumors, as well as by non-pituitary tumors (such as in the lung, thyroid and pancreas) that produce ACTH and lead to excess stimulation of steroid synthesis in the adrenal cortex. Approximately 70% of CS patients have pituitary tumors, 20% have adrenal tumors and the balance have ectopic tumors. Many cases of CS can be cured through surgery, but for those cases where the tumor is inoperable or where surgery is unsuccessful, medical management can be challenging.
 Our approach to the treatment of CS is based on the same mechanism of action of nevanimibe, at similar dosing levels, that we are exploring for the treatment of CAH. In preclinical studies, nevanimibe was observed to be associated with dose and time-dependent decreases in basal and ACTH stimulated cortisol levels. Additionally, in canines with naturally-occurring CS, nevanimibe treatment was observed to result in the decrease of ACTH-stimulated cortisol levels 

 
  15

 
in 90% of the subjects treated regardless of the cause. The figure below shows the effects of nevanimibe on cortisol levels in dogs with naturally-occurring CS treated with nevanimibe for 14 days:

 We are currently conducting a Phase 2 trial of nevanimibe for the treatment of patients with CS. This trial, including both an open-label portion and a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled portion, is being conducted in up to 16 adults and is designed to provide dosing and efficacy information. Enrollment in the trial is ongoing. In the open-label portion, patients will be dose escalated until they achieve the goal of cortisol control or the dose escalation period ends. Patients will then progress to a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled withdrawal period. The primary endpoint of this trial is the proportion of subjects with either a normal 24-hour urinary free cortisol, or UFC, or a reduction in UFC of greater than 50% relative to baseline values at the end of the randomized, double-blind withdrawal period. Secondary endpoints include effects on other steroid measurements, pharmacokinetic measurements and safety assessments.
 If we are successful in receiving regulatory approval, nevanimibe has the potential to be a first-in-class agent that directly reduces cortisol levels in CS patients. Nevanimibe has received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of CS.
 Sales and Marketing
 We have worldwide development and commercialization rights with respect to both of our current product candidates. 
 If approved by the FDA, we plan to commercialize both of our current product candidates in the United States ourselves. As we advance livoletide and nevanimibe through clinical development, we plan to grow our commercial organization in support of anticipated product launches. We intend to build a small, specialized sales force to market livoletide and nevanimibe targeting endocrinologists. We intend to focus on patient support and reimbursement assistance in order to facilitate patient access, uptake and compliance for all indications. We also intend to develop health economic models demonstrating the value of livoletide and nevanimibe to third-party payors.
 Outside of the United States, we plan to strategically consider collaboration or partnering opportunities to allow us to efficiently allocate resources to maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates, if approved.
 Research and Development
 We believe that there are many opportunities to leverage our deep endocrine expertise to develop new treatments for endocrine diseases with significant unmet medical needs. We will also continue to seek research and 

 
  16

 
development synergies across all our programs and indications. However, we also plan to aggressively pursue licensing or acquisitions of novel therapeutic opportunities exploiting biological discoveries that can transform the treatment of endocrine diseases. In this way, we expect to expand our portfolio as we continue to build our pipeline as a leading endocrine company.
 License Agreement with the University of Michigan
 In June 2013, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Michigan, or the UM License Agreement, for a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable license to the University of Michigan’s interest in certain patent rights jointly owned with us, covering, among other things, the use of nevanimibe to treat CAH and CS. Such license rights allow us to make, have made, import, export, use, market, offer for sale and sell products containing nevanimibe for such uses in the United States. Under the UM License Agreement, the University of Michigan reserved the right to practice the licensed patent rights for its own internal research, public service and internal educational purposes and to grant such rights to other non-profit research institutions solely for its internal use.
 The UM License Agreement requires that products containing nevanimibe that are used or sold in the United States must be manufactured substantially in the United States. The UM License Agreement further obligates us to use commercially reasonable efforts to bring at least one product containing nevanimibe subject to the licensed rights to market, and to continue active, diligent marketing efforts using commercially reasonable efforts for any such product that achieves regulatory approval throughout the term of the UM License Agreement. We are further obligated under the UM License Agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and retain any necessary governmental approvals that are required to manufacture and/or sell products containing nevanimibe that are subject to the licensed patents.
 We agreed under the UM License Agreement to use commercially reasonably efforts to reach certain commercialization, research and development milestones by certain dates. We have the right to extend by a specified period the time it takes to achieve such commercialization, research and development milestones upon notice and payment to the University of Michigan of a low six figure fee. We may exercise such right up to a specified number of times during the term of the UM License Agreement. To date, we have not exercised such option.
 As consideration for the rights granted to us under the UM License Agreement, we agreed to pay the University of Michigan a flat, low single figure royalty on net sales of product containing nevanimibe that are covered by the claims of the licensed patents, with minimum royalties per year ranging between $10,000 and $20,000 through 2023 and minimum royalties per year of $0.2 million beginning in 2024 through expiration of the term of the UM License Agreement. We also agreed to make payments to the University of Michigan totaling up to $2.5 million upon the achievement of certain development and commercial milestones, of which $0.1 million was paid during the year ended December 31, 2017. No amounts were paid in 2018 related to the achievement of development or commercial milestones.
 We have also agreed to pay a tiered percentage of revenues, other than revenues based on net sales, received under a sublicense of the rights granted under the UM License Agreement. Such revenue percentages range from a mid-single digit to low double digits depending on the stage of development of nevanimibe at the time of the applicable sublicense, with the lower percentages applicable to sublicenses granted at later stages of development.
 The UM License Agreement will expire upon expiration of the last to expire of the issued patents that are the subject of the UM License Agreement that would be infringed by our making, having made, using, marketing, importing, exporting, offering to sell and selling of products containing nevanimibe. We may terminate the UM License Agreement upon 90 days’ notice. The University of Michigan may terminate the UM License Agreement for any uncured failure to pay amounts due the University of Michigan or for any other uncured material breach, which includes our failure to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to meet research and development milestones by certain deadlines, and if we challenge the validity or enforceability of the licensed patents.

 Assignment Agreement with Erasmus University Medical Center and the University of Turin
 We have an assignment agreement with Erasmus University Medical Center, the University of Turin and certain individuals, which we refer to collectively as the assignors, for certain patents and patent applications relating to livoletide.
 In connection with the assignment agreement, we agreed to pay the assignors a flat, low single digit royalty on net commercial sales of products containing livoletide that are covered by the claims of the assigned intellectual property. Further, upon approval of livoletide by the FDA or EMA, we are required to pay the assignors CDN$100,000, which amount will be deducted from any future royalty payments due to the assignors. We also agreed to pay the assignors a low single digit percentage of any amounts received in connection with our license of the assigned intellectual property or products containing livoletide that are covered by the claims of the assigned intellectual property.
 The assignors have a right to repurchase the assigned intellectual property at a certain price in the event we do not, upon receiving notice, use reasonable efforts to develop, introduce for sale and promote products derived from the assigned intellectual property. Such reasonable efforts involve spending an annual amount of at least CDN$100,000 in research and development related to livoletide, actively pursuing the registration, licenses and permits necessary to market livoletide, and the actual commercialization of livoletide, if approved. In addition, pursuant to the assignment agreement, certain individuals at the Erasmus University Medical Center and the University of Turin were granted non-exclusive rights to use the assigned intellectual property for non-commercial research with our prior written consent.
 Competition
 The commercialization of new drugs is competitive, and we may face worldwide competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and ultimately generic companies. Our competitors may develop or market therapies that are more effective, safer or less costly than any that we are commercializing, or may obtain regulatory or reimbursement approval for their therapies more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours.
 With respect to ours efforts to treat patients with PWS, livoletide is the only UAG analogue in development. Compounds with several different mechanisms are in clinical development by others for the treatment of PWS. Soleno Therapeutics, Inc. is currently developing diazoxide choline controlled release, an ATP-sensitive potassium channel agonist, and Levo Therapeutics, Inc. is pursuing development of carbetocin, a long-acting analogue of oxytocin. Each of Saniona AB, GLWL Research Inc. and Insys Therapeutics, Inc. have also announced or initiated smaller trials in PWS for the treatment of hyperphagia. There are also a number of compounds in preclinical development.
 With respect to nevanimibe to treat patients with CAH, we believe that there are a limited number of products in development that are focused on the indication. Diurnal Group PLC is developing an exogenous cortisol treatment with a modified release intended to more closely match the physiological release profile of cortisol but recently announced a failed Phase 3 study and placed their U.S. development activities on hold. Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. has an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial targeting CRF 1, and Spruce Biosciences, Inc. is developing a CRF 1 antagonist in a Phase 2 clinical trial. Novartis AG is currently marketing Signifor and Corcept Therapeutics Inc. is currently marketing Korlym, both for the treatment of subsets of CS patients. There are several other product candidates currently in clinical development for CS, including by Novartis, Corcept, HRA Pharma, SA and StrongBridge BioPharma plc.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success will significantly depend upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for our drug candidates in the United States and internationally, including composition-of-matter, dosage and formulation patents, as well as patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for our novel biological discoveries and other important technology inventions and know-how. In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our 

 
  18

 
employees as well as selected commercial partners and consultants. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages. In addition, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 We seek patent protection in significant markets and/or countries for each drug in development. We also seek to maximize patent term. The patent exclusivity period for a drug will prevent generic drugs from entering the market. Patent exclusivity depends on a number of factors including the initial patent term, patent term adjustments and available patent term extensions based upon delays caused by the regulatory approval process.
 The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our product candidates. As of December 31, 2018, with respect to livoletide patent rights, we owned four issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application, and a number of patents and pending patent applications in other jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2018, with respect to nevanimibe patent rights, we owned two issued U.S. patents, two pending U.S. patent applications, and a number of pending patent applications in other jurisdictions, and we jointly owned, with University of Michigan, three issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application, and a number of patent applications in other jurisdictions. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we pursue will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide any proprietary protection from competitors. The patent portfolios for our leading product candidates as of December 31, 2018 are summarized below.
 Livoletide
 With respect to livoletide patent rights, as of December 31, 2018, we owned four issued U.S. patents, which are not due to expire before 2028, 2028, 2029, and 2033, respectively, excluding any additional term for patent term extension pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act; one pending U.S. patent application, which is not due to expire before 2034, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or extension; and a number of patent applications in other jurisdictions. The foregoing patents and patent applications cover a form of and methods of making and using livoletide or its analogs. Related international patent applications have issued in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, and Mexico and are pending in a number of other countries, including Canada, Europe, and India. Nevanimibe
 With respect to nevanimibe patent rights, as of December 31, 2018, we owned two issued U.S. patents, which are not due to expire before 2035, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or extension; two pending U.S. patent applications, which, if issued, are not due to expire before 2035 and 2036, respectively, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or extension; and a number of patent applications in other jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2018, we jointly owned, with University of Michigan, three issued U.S. patents, which are each not due to expire before 2033, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or extensions; one pending U.S. patent application, which, if issued, is not due to expire before 2033, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or extension; and a number of patent applications in other jurisdictions. The foregoing patents and patent applications cover a form of and methods of making and using nevanimibe or its analogs. Related international patent applications have issued in China and New Zealand and are pending in a number of other countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and Mexico. Manufacturing
 We rely on contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce drug candidates in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations for use in our clinical trials. The manufacture of pharmaceuticals is subject to extensive cGMP regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation 

 
  19

 
requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control. Our peptide and small molecule drug candidates, livoletide and nevanimibe, are manufactured using common chemical engineering and synthetic processes from readily available raw materials.
 To meet our projected needs for clinical supplies to support its activities through regulatory approval and commercial manufacturing, the CMOs with whom we currently work may need to increase the scale of production or we will need to secure alternate suppliers. We believe that there are multiple potential sources for our contract manufacturing, but we have not engaged alternate suppliers in the event that its current CMOs are unable to scale production. Our relationships with CMOs are managed by internal personnel with extensive experience in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing.
 If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of drug candidates or receive raw materials in a timely manner, we could be required to delay its ongoing clinical trials and seek alternative manufacturers, which would be costly and time-consuming.
 Government Regulation and Approval
 United States-FDA process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of drugs. To obtain regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, and subsequently comply with applicable statutes and regulations, we will need to spend substantial time and financial resources.
 Approval process
 The FDA must approve any new drug or a drug with certain changes to a previously approved drug before a manufacturer can market it in the United States. If a company does not comply with applicable United States requirements it may be subject to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending applications, warning or untitled letters, clinical holds, drug recalls, drug seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. The steps we must complete before we can market a drug include:

· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical studies start. The sponsor must update the IND annually;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval of the study by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical study begins;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication to the FDA’s satisfaction;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


· | potential review of the drug application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, cGMP, or regulations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 
 
  20

 

 It generally takes companies many years to satisfy the FDA approval requirements, but this varies substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the drug or disease. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of a drug’s chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the drug. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. The company submits the results of the preclinical testing to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about the product drug’s chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical study protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, are generally conducted after submitting the initial IND.
 The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND before the company can begin clinical testing in humans in the United States. The FDA may, within the 30-day time period, raise concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical studies and place the study on a clinical hold. In such a case, the company and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the company begins the clinical study. Accordingly, the content of an IND submission may or may not be sufficient for the FDA to permit the sponsor to start a clinical study. The company must also make a separate submission to an existing IND for each successive clinical study conducted in the U.S. during drug development.
 Clinical studies
 Clinical studies involve administering the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. The company must conduct clinical studies:

· | in compliance with federal regulations;
--+----------------------------------------


· | in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical study sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the safety monitoring parameters, and the effectiveness criteria.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The company must submit each protocol involving testing on United States patients and subsequent protocol amendments to the FDA as part of the IND. The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical study at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the sponsor is not conducting the clinical study in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical study patients. The sponsor must also submit the study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical studies to an institutional review board for approval. An IRB may halt the clinical study, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 Companies generally divide the clinical investigation of a drug into three or four phases. While companies usually conduct these phases sequentially, they are sometimes overlapped or combined.

· | Phase 1. The company evaluates the drug in healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies typically evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational new drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2. The company administers the drug to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3. The company administers the drug to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites, to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a drug on the company’s agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  21

 

conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. We typically refer to such post-approval studies as Phase 4 clinical studies.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A pivotal study is a clinical study that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements to evaluate a drug’s efficacy and safety to justify the approval of the drug. Generally, pivotal studies are Phase 3 studies, but the FDA may accept results from Phase 2 studies if the study design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations in which there is an unmet medical need and the results are sufficiently robust. 
 The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical study sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, may oversee some clinical studies. This group provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical study based on evolving business objectives and the competitive climate. 
 Submission of an NDA
 After a company completes the required clinical testing, it can prepare and submit an NDA to the FDA, who must approve the NDA before it can start marketing the drug in the United States. An NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the drug’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies on a drug, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators or studies not conducted under a U.S. IND. To support marketing authorization, the data we submit must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug to the FDA’s satisfaction.
 The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved new drug application are also subject to annual program user fees. The FDA typically increases these fees annually. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether it will accept the application for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the FDA accepts the filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of responding to standard review NDAs within ten months after the 60-day filing review period, but this timeframe may be extended. The FDA reviews most applications for standard review drugs within ten to 12 months and most applications for priority review drugs within six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists.
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee. This is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts that will review, evaluate, and recommend whether the FDA should approve the application. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP, and will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the drug unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 The FDA’s decision on an NDA
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter indicates that the FDA has completed its review of the application, and the agency has determined that it will not approve the application in its present form. A complete response letter

generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional clinical data and/or other significant, expensive, and time-consuming requirements related to clinical studies, preclinical studies and/or manufacturing. The FDA has committed to reviewing resubmissions of the NDA addressing such deficiencies in two or six months, depending on the type of information included. Even if we submit such data, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Also, the government may establish additional requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our drugs under development.
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include communication plans for healthcare professionals, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, the FDA may condition approval on substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, the FDA may withdraw drug approvals if the company fails to comply with regulatory standards or identifies problems following initial marketing.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before we can implement the change. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing new NDAs. As with new NDAs, the FDA often significantly extends the review process with requests for additional information or clarification.
 Post-approval requirements
 The FDA regulates drugs that are manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals and has specific requirements pertaining to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, drug sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. After approval, the FDA must provide review and approval for most changes to the approved drug, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed drugs and the establishments who manufacture its drugs, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 Drug manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. There are strict regulations regarding changes to the manufacturing process, and, depending on the significance of the change, it may require prior FDA approval before we can implement it. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if a company does not comply with regulatory requirements and maintain standards or if problems occur after the drug reaches the market. If a company or the FDA discovers previously unknown problems with a drug, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, issues with manufacturing processes, or the company’s failure to comply with regulatory requirements, the FDA may revise the approved labeling to add new safety information; impose post-marketing studies or other clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or impose distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences may include:

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the drug, complete withdrawal of the drug from the market or drug recalls;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  23

 


· | the FDA refusing to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspending or revoking of drug license approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | drug seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of drugs; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

  The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of drugs that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. We could be subject to significant liability if we violated these laws and regulations.
 Orphan drug designation
 The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to sponsors of drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States.
 Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a drug receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the drug may be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the drug with orphan exclusivity.
 Pediatric information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which the FDA has granted an orphan designation.
 Healthcare reform
 In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect the future results of our operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reform the way in which healthcare is funded and reduce healthcare costs. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively PPACA, was enacted, which includes measures that have significantly changed health care financing by both governmental and private insurers. The provisions of PPACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are, among others, the following:

· | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  24

 

their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, unless the drug is subject to discounts under the 340B drug discount program;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | new requirements under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act for drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | new requirement to annually report certain drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to licensed practitioners, or to pharmacies of hospitals or other healthcare entities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Some of the provisions of the PPACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the PPACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, included a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain PPACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the PPACA to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. More recently, in July 2018, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain PPACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the PPACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the PPACA will impact the PPACA.
 In addition, other health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the United States since PPACA was enacted. For example, as a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, providers are subject to Medicare payment reductions of 2% per fiscal year through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments from providers from three to five years.
 More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and 

 
  25

 
enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contained further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. On January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General, proposed modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute discount safe harbor for the purpose of reducing the cost of drug products to consumers which, among other things, if finalized, will affect discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers working with these organizations. While some proposed measures may require additional authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 European Union-EMA process
 In the European Union, our product candidates are also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization, or MA, from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Clinical trials of medicinal products in the European Union must be conducted in accordance with European Union and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on Good Clinical Practices, or GCP. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the European Union clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the Member State regimes. To improve the current system, Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, which repealed Directive 2001/20/EC, was adopted on April 16, 2014 and published in the European Official Journal on May 27, 2014. The Regulation aims to harmonize and streamline the clinical trials authorization process, simplify adverse event reporting procedures, improve the supervision of clinical trials, and increase their transparency. Although the Regulation entered into force on June 16, 2014, it will not be applicable until six months after the full functionality of the IT portal and database envisaged in the Regulation is confirmed. This is not expected to occur until the course of 2019. Until then the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC will still apply.
 Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU Member States where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, or SUSARs, to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred  and would also be reported in all countries where the drug is being used in a clinical trial.

 Approval Process
 Under the centralized procedure, after the EMA issues an opinion, the European Commission issues a single marketing authorization valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering; contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders diseases or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions; advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines; and officially designated orphan drugs. For drugs that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the drug concerned contains a new active substance; is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation,; or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
 There are also three other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in the European Union, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:

· | National procedure. National MAs, issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA, are available however these only cover their respective territory;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in any European Union country; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Thereafter, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We do not foresee that any of our current product candidates will be suitable for a National MA as they fall within the mandatory criteria for the Centralized Procedure. Therefore, our product candidates will be reviewed and approved through Centralized Procedure.
 Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, all applications for marketing authorization for new medicines must include the results of all studies performed and details of all information collected in compliance with as described in a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed between regulatory authorities, the EMA’s Paediatric Committee, and the applicant, unless the medicine is exempt because of a deferral or waiver (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults). Applicants are encourage to submit pediatric investigation plans early during product development, in time for studies to be conducted in the pediatric population, where appropriate, before marketing authorization applications are submitted.  Before the EMA is able to begin its assessment of a centralized procedure MA application, it will validate that the applicant has complied with an agreed pediatric investigation plan, or an application for a waiver has been submitted. The applicant and the EMA may, where such a step is adequately justified, agree to modify a pediatric investigation plan to assist validation. Modifications are not always possible; may take longer to agree than the period of validation permits; and may still require the applicant to withdraw its marketing authorization application, or MA, and to conduct additional non-clinical and clinical studies.  Products that are granted a MA on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate or a patent qualifying for a supplementary protection (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or certificate or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.

 Orphan drug designation
 In the European Union, Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, as amended, states that a drug will be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish:

· | that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union when the application is made, or that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, that the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Regulation (EC) No 847/2000 sets out further provisions for implementation of the criteria for designation of a drug as an orphan drug. An application for the designation of a drug as an orphan drug may be submitted at any stage of development of the drug before submission of a MA application.  However, an application for designation as an orphan drug may be submitted for a new therapeutic indication for an already authorized medicinal product.
 If a centralized procedure MA in respect of an orphan drug is granted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, regulatory authorities will not, for a period of 10 years, accept another application for a MA, or grant a MA or accept an application to extend an existing MA, for the same therapeutic indication, in respect of a similar drug. This period may however be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established, in respect of the drug concerned, that the criteria for orphan drug designation are no longer met, for example, when it is shown on the basis of available evidence that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. The exclusivity period may increase to 12 years if, among other things, the MA includes the results of studies from an agreed pediatric investigation plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a MA may be granted for the same therapeutic indication to a similar drug if:

· | the holder of the MA for the original orphan drug has given its consent to the second applicant;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the holder of the MA for the original orphan drug is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the drug; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the second applicant can establish in the application that the second drug, although similar to the orphan drug already authorized, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Regulation (EC) No 847/2000 lays down definitions of the concepts ‘similar drug’ and ‘clinical superiority’. Other incentives available to orphan drugs in the European Union include financial incentives such as a reduction of fees or fee waivers and protocol assistance. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 Good manufacturing practices
 Like the FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States and other regulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacturing of drugs intended for the EU market to ensure that certain minimum standards are met. These requirements apply, no matter where in the world the manufacturing process takes place and are designed to ensure that products intended for the EU market are of consistent high quality, are appropriate for their intended use and meet the requirements of the marketing authorization or clinical trial authorization.  If, after receiving clearance from regulatory agencies, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. We and our partners will be required to continue to comply with cGMP, and drug-specific regulations enforced by, the European Commission, the EMA and the competent authorities of European Union Member States following drug approval. Also like the FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States and other regulatory agencies also conduct regular, periodic visits to reinspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a 

 
  28

 
drug. If, as a result of these inspections, the regulatory agencies determine that we or our partners’ equipment, facilities, or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of drug approval, they may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of its manufacturing operations or the withdrawal of our drug from the market.
 Post-Approval Controls
 The holder of a European MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, or QPPV, who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
 All new MAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place, recording the product’s safety profile and documenting the effectiveness of risk-minimization measures. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each EU Member State and can differ from one country to another.
 Data and market exclusivity
 Similar to the United States, there is a process to authorize generic versions of innovative drugs in the European Union. Generic competitors can, where data exclusivity has expired, submit abridged applications to authorize generic versions of drugs authorized by the EMA through the centralized procedure referencing the innovator’s data and demonstrating bioequivalence to the reference drug, among other things. If a marketing authorization is granted for a medicinal product containing a new active substance, that product benefits from eight years of data exclusivity, during which generic marketing authorization applications referring to the data of that product may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities, and a further two years of market exclusivity, during which such generic products may not be placed on the market. The two-year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved. This system is usually referred to as “8+2”. There is also a special regime for biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal product but that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product, for example, because of differences in raw materials or manufacturing processes. For such products, the results of appropriate preclinical or clinical trials must be provided, and guidelines from the EMA detail the type of quantity of supplementary data to be provided for different types of biological product.  In addition, there are certain circumstances, such as where the innovator company is granted a marketing authorization for a significant new indication for the relevant medicinal product, where an additional one year of marketing exclusivity may be granted.   As referenced above, orphan medicinal products are subject to separate marketing exclusivity arrangements.
 Other international markets-drug approval process
 In some international markets (such as China or Japan), although data generated in United States or European Union trials may be submitted in support of a marketing authorization application, regulators may require additional clinical studies conducted in the host territory, or studying people of the ethnicity of the host territory, prior to the filing or approval of marketing applications within the country.

 
  29

 

 Pricing and reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drugs for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any drugs for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drugs on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drugs can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular drug does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on its investment in drug development.
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of drugs and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. To obtain coverage and reimbursement for any drug that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of its drug. These studies will be in addition to the studies required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a drug to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the drug after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its drugs at a profit.
 The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic drugs for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, PPACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drugs, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for our drugs.
 In the European Community, governments influence the price of drugs through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those drugs to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which drugs may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical studies that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new drugs. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any drugs for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if government and other third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. In addition, the focus on cost containment measures in the United States and other countries has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time.
 Other healthcare laws impacting sales, marketing, and other company activities
 Numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the U.S. Department of Justice, and similar foreign, state, and local government authorities, regulate and enforce laws and regulations applicable to sales, promotion and other activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers. These laws and regulations may impact, among other things, our 

 
  30

 
clinical research programs, proposed sales and marketing and education activities, and financial and business relationships with future prescribers of our product candidates, once approved. These laws and regulations include U.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign anti-kickback, false claims, and data privacy and security laws, which are described below, among other legal requirements that may affect our current and future operations.
 The FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities for drugs under its jurisdiction both prior to and after approval. Only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that the FDA has approved may be used in labeling once the drug is approved. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug’s labeling and that differ from those we tested and the FDA approved. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties, and often reflect a physician’s belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for the patients. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. If we do not comply with applicable FDA requirements we may face adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA. Promotion of off-label uses of drugs can also implicate the false claims laws described below.
 Anti-kickback laws including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute that applies to items and services reimbursable under governmental healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, make it illegal for a person or entity to, among other things, knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item, or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions, limited statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, and the scarcity of guidance in the form of regulations, agency advisory opinions, sub-regulatory guidance and judicial decisions addressing industry practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. Moreover, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, PPACA among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain other criminal healthcare fraud statutes to clarify that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a crime. In addition, PPACA clarifies that the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
 False claims laws, including, without limitation, the federal civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws prohibit, among other things, anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment, to the federal government (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursement for, among other things, drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sales and marketing of its drugs may be subject to scrutiny under these laws, as well as civil monetary penalties laws and the criminal healthcare fraud provisions enacted as part of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA.
 HIPAA imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and imposes requirements with respect to safeguarding the security and privacy of protected health information on HIPAA covered entities and their business associates who provide services involving HIPAA protected health information to such covered entities.
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health

Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to the government ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members.
 In addition, we may be subject to state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback, self-referral, and false claims laws which may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and submitting claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to file reports with states regarding marketing information, such as the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing; state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales and medical representatives; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Violations of these laws may result in significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm and the imposition of corporate integrity agreements or other similar agreements with governmental entities, which may impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties, as well as individual imprisonment, also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees, including criminal sanctions against executive officers under the so-called “responsible corporate officer” doctrine, even in situations where the executive officer did not intend to violate the law and was unaware of any wrongdoing. Given the significant penalties and fines that can be imposed on companies and individuals if convicted, allegations of such violations often result in settlements even if the company or individual being investigated admits no wrongdoing. Settlements often include significant civil sanctions and additional corporate integrity obligations. If the government were to allege or convict us or our executive officers of violating these laws, our business could be harmed.
 Similar rigid restrictions are imposed on the promotion and marketing of drugs in the European Union and other countries. Even in those countries where we may not be directly responsible for the promotion and marketing of our drugs, if our potential international distribution partners engage in inappropriate activity it can have adverse implications for us.
