Corporate Structure
 
The following is an organizational chart setting forth our corporate structure as of the date of this Annual Report.
 


Industry Overview
 
Solid Waste Recycling Equipment Industry
 
According to The 2018 Annual Report On The Prevention And Control Of Environmental Pollution By Large And Medium-Sized Municipal Solid Waste published by the Ministry of Ecology And Environment of The People’s Republic of China in December 2018 , in 2017, approximately 1.31 billion tons of industrial solid waste and 40.101 million tons of Industrial hazardous waste were generated by large and medium-sized cities in the PRC; Meanwhile , according to the status from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the PRC published on May 30, 2018, China's accumulative storage of industrial solid waste exceeds 60 billion tons, covering an area of over 2 million hectares. In the PRC, industrial solid waste is generally handled by one of the following methods:

● | storage in special facilities or sites;
--+----------------------------------------


● | disposal in landfills, incineration or related means; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | recycling or comprehensive utilization, such as the process utilized by Shengrong, consisting of extracting or converting valuable raw materials from industrial solid waste;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Storage is the most popular method in China which is widely used in all over the country. Approximately 95% of industrial solid waste in the PRC is stored in special facilities and sites, including warehouses for mining slags or tails.
 
However, the cost of storage, disposal and incineration of industrial solid wastes is high. It is estimated by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China that during the next several years, the expense for environmental protection will increase by approximately RMB 200 billion annually, with total expenses for environmental protection from 2013 to 2023 expected to be RMB 1.7 trillion, twice the total expenses for environmental protection from 2002 to 2012. In additional, storage and disposal of industrial waste creates numerous challenges because significant land mass is required and disposal causes pollution to the environment.
 
Shengrong WFOE is addressing this significant unmet need by provide end users in these markets with a clean alternative to traditional waste disposal by significantly reducing of solid waste discharge into the environment and enables such users to extract value from valuable metals and other industrial waste materials.
 
Solid waste recycling equipment manufacturers typically situated in the upstream supply chain. In China, a broad of range of solid waste processing and recycling equipment hit the market in recent years including solid waste pretreatment equipment, hazardous waste recycling equipment and solid waste incinerators.
 
Although solid waste recycling equipment industry has an excellent growth potential, it is still a small-scale industry with few full-fledged players. Solid waste recycling and utilization, unlike many western countries, is a relatively new concept in China. As a result, most solid waste recycling equipment manufacturers are currently in their development stage with rudimentary production capabilities. We believe few of them has the capacity to produce a full set of solid waste recycling equipment covering all the industrial needs. These manufacturers are small and medium enterprises plagued by lack of technical support and creativity. Some equipment, such as landfill leachate treatment equipment, large-scale incineration plant, and online environmental monitoring system must be imported almost exclusively from other countries. Because of their lack of research and development capabilities, most solid waste recycling equipment manufacturers have to engage in joint venture with foreign companies. For example, more than 80% of Chinese incineration plant manufacturers have no choice but to partner with foreign companies in order to manufacture their products. Given that these solid waste recycling equipment manufacturers are low-end manufacturers, they frequently operate at lower profit margin than those in the western countries.
 
As more mandatory energy conservation and emission reduction target-setting policies on the horizon, we believe there will be an increasing demand for high-quality and technologically-advanced solid waste recycling equipment in China, and competition in the solid waste recycling equipment industry will continue to intensify. Solid waste recycling equipment sales will compete not only on price, but also on quality, technology, service and brand.

Chinese Coating Trading Market
 
According to the preliminary statistics of the bureau of statistics, in 2017, the annual output of 1,380 industrial enterprises above designated size in the coating industry reached 20.364,000 tons, up 12.38% year on year, exceeding the expected output. The main business income of 2,057 industrial enterprises above designated size reached 417.289 billion yuan, up 5.0% year on year. The total output of coatings industry, the main business revenue growth since 2016, continued to grow, in the case of a part of the upstream raw material prices continue to rise still maintained a good growth relative to the chemical industry, in "much starker choices-and graver consequences-in" period, the decisive phase of the well-off society, all kinds of engineering, manufacturing is still a huge demand for coating, will be a period of time in the future continue to maintain high growth.
 
The main products of Wuhan Host are anticorrosive coatings and water-based anticorrosive coatings. Heavy anticorrosive coating has excellent acid resistance, corrosion resistance, moisture and heat resistance, at the same time, high solid content, low volatile organic, environmentally friendly; the water-based coating has the advantages of good salt spray resistance, good fullness and glossiness, excellent decorative properties, safety, health and environmental protection. Accord with the development direction of Chinese coating.
 
Chinese Coal Trading Market
 
Global coal is still the main energy source. According to the International Energy Agency's Global Coal Market Report (2018-2103) on February 25, 2019, global demand for coal will remain stable in the next five years. China will remain the world's biggest consumer of coal. In particular, the clean and efficient development of China's coal industry, as well as the strengthening of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and soot emission control, has made coal once again a very attractive energy source. In addition, due to its affordable price, abundant reserves and convenient transportation, coal remains the main energy source in many other countries besides China. Therefore, the coal market in China remains strong.

Competition among providers of low grade hematite separation systems in China can be characterized as niche market. Our primary competitors for these systems are Ganzhou Jinhuan Magnetic Separation Equipment Co., Ltd., which is a supplier, producer, manufacturer of high gradient magnetic separators (HGMS) and wet high intensity magnetic separators (WHIMS). It designs, develops, manufactures and markets magnetic separation equipment for beneficiating weakly magnetic minerals, and for purifying non-metallic minerals.), Shenyang Longji Electromagnetic Science and Technology Co., Ltd., which is a supplier of steam condensed water iron removing filter, condensed water iron removing filter, high temperature condensed water iron removing filter), Yueyang Dalishen Electromagnetic Mechanical and Electrical Co., Ltd. and Guangzhou Nonferrous Metals Research Institute. Shengrong WFOE believes it competes favorably with them because it has a series of self-owned unique patents in China which have already been utilized in the production of the environmental protection equipment. Some of Shengrong WFOE’s patents were also registered in the U   .S. We believe that our technology are superior because our proprietary processing method does not result in the high cost electromagnetic high gradient magnetic separation process with hematite involved in the use of chemical methods used by our competitor.

Based on collective extensive experience in the industry, Shengrong WOFE management believes that it is one of the leading enterprise in China in the design and sale of solid waste recycling systems for the mining and industrial sectors in the PRC. However, there can be no assurance that our initial competitive advantage will be retained and that one or more competitors will not develop systems that are equal or superior to ours or are better priced than our systems.
 
Competition for Wuhan Host’s business
 
According to the preliminary statistics of the Bureau of Statistics, in 2017, the annual output of 1,380 industrial enterprises above designated size in the coating industry reached 20.364,000 tons, a 12.38% year on year increase, exceeding the expected output. The main business income of 2,057 industrial enterprises above designated size reached 417.289 billion yuan, up 5.0% year on year. The total output of coatings industry, the main business revenue growth since 2016, continued to grow, in the case of a part of the upstream raw material prices continue to rise still maintained a good growth relative to the chemical industry, in "much starker choices-and graver consequences-in" period, the decisive phase of the well-off society, all kinds of engineering, manufacturing is still a huge demand for coating, will be a period of time in the future continue to maintain high growth.
 
After 2016, the pressure of environmental protection has increased but not decreased. The severe pressure of environmental protection has led to the upgrading of products, industries and production lines, and the overall cost has increased rapidly within a short time. Although the environmental protection pressure high strength in recent one or two years to paint coating enterprise caused a certain economic loss, but overall, these losses are worth it, is also must, under high pressure, forcing coating, coating enterprise seek survival, prompting investment environment friendly coatings products and coating technology and equipment research and development, is advantageous to the industry to develop in the direction of high-end in green.
 
According to the ecological civilization construction and green development road map formulated at the 19th CPC national congress, the requirements of green development will certainly promote coating enterprises to accelerate the pace of product transformation to green and environment-friendly direction. The transformation process will bring new development space and opportunities to enterprises, and China's coating industry will usher in a new development period.
 
Wuhan HOST always focus on the coating industry, new materials technology accumulation, product innovation, industrial chain synergy and brand core competitive advantages, such as with the client's leading enterprises, brand enterprises established long-term stable cooperative relations, no matter from the enterprise scale and comprehensive strength, the company is still in the domestic industry leader.
 
Wuhan HOST adheres to market-oriented, based on the main industry, vigorously innovate, improve the level of research and development, and share new technology with customers to bring market appreciation. It has not only trained the company's own scientific research team, but also established a set of scientific research and development system. While focusing on independent research and development, it has enhanced the company's advantages in the industry through cooperative development and introduction and digestion.
 
Competition for Jiangsu Ronghai
 
The local competition is fierce. Our principal competitor is Nantong Huagang Materials Trading Co., Ltd.. However, as we have strengths in processing, transportation and reputation, we have been maintaining a favorable position against our competitor and earn loyalty from our largest customer.

Environmental Matters
 
The Environmental Protection Law, promulgated by the National People’s Congress on December 26, 1989, is the primary law for environmental protection in China. The law establishes basic principles for coordinated advancement of economic growth, social progress and environmental protection, and defines the rights and duties of governments at all levels. Local environmental protection bureaus may set stricter local standards than the national standards and enterprises are required to comply with the stricter of the two sets of standards. Due to the nature of our business, we may produce certain amounts of waste water and solid waste materials during the course of our production. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable PRC laws and regulations. All of our products in all material respects meet the relevant environmental requirements under PRC laws and during the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we were not subject to any fines or legal action involving non-compliance with any relevant environmental regulation, nor are we aware of any threatened or pending action, including by any environmental regulatory authority.
 
Wuhan Host received Letter of Acceptance Opinions on Environmental Protection for The Completion of The 4000t/a New Industrial Coating Material Production Project of Wuhan Host Coating Material Co., LTD., issued by the Administrative Examination and Approval Bureau of E Zhou Gedian Economic and Technological Development Zone on June 27, 2017.As of December 31, 2018, Wuhan Host was not subject to any fines or legal action involving non-compliance with any relevant environmental regulation, nor are we aware of any threatened or pending action, including by any environmental regulatory authority.
 
As of December 31, 2018, Jiangsu Ronghai was not subject to any fines or legal action involving non-compliance with any relevant environmental regulation, nor are we aware of any threatened or pending action, including by any environmental regulatory authority.
 
Governmental Regulations
 
Business license
 
Any company that conducts business in the PRC must have a business license that covers a particular type of work. Our business license covers our present business of manufacturing, sale and lease of environment protection equipment, development of environment protection technologies and related technology and consulting services. Prior to expanding our business beyond that of our business license, we are required to apply and receive approval from the PRC government.
 
Employment laws
 
We are subject to laws and regulations governing our relationship with our employees, including: wage and hour requirements, working and safety conditions, citizenship requirements, work permits and travel restrictions. These include local labor laws and regulations, which may require substantial resources for compliance. China’s National Labor Law, which became effective on January 1, 1995, and amended on August 27, 2009, and China’s National Labor Contract Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008, and amended on December 28, 2012, permit workers in both state and private enterprises in China to bargain collectively. The National Labor Law and the National Labor Contract Law provide for collective contracts to be developed through collaboration between the labor union (or worker representatives in the absence of a union) and management that specify such matters as working conditions, wage scales, and hours of work. The laws also permit workers and employers in all types of enterprises to sign individual contracts, which are to be drawn up in accordance with the collective contract.
 
Intellectual property protection in China
 
Patent. The PRC has domestic laws for the protection of copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets. The PRC is also signatory to some of the world’s major intellectual property conventions, including:
 

● | Convention establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO Convention) (June 4, 1980);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (March 19, 1985);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patent Cooperation Treaty (January 1, 1994); and
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) (November 11, 2001).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Patents in the PRC are governed by the China Patent Law and its Implementing Regulations, each of which went into effect in 1985. Amended versions of the China Patent Law and its Implementing Regulations came into effect in 1993, 2001 and 2009, respectively.
 
13

 

The PRC is signatory to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, in accordance with which any person who has duly filed an application for a patent in one signatory country shall enjoy, for the purposes of filing in the other countries, a right of priority during the period fixed in the convention (12 months for inventions and utility models, and 6 months for industrial designs).
 
The Patent Law covers three kinds of patents — patents for inventions, utility models and designs. The Chinese patent system adopts the principle of first to file, which means that a patent may be granted only to the person who first files an application. Consistent with international practice, the PRC allows the patenting of inventions or utility models that possess the characteristics of novelty, inventiveness and practical applicability only. For a design to be patentable it cannot be identical with, or similar to, any design which, before the date of filing, has been publicly disclosed in publications in the country or abroad or has been publicly used in the country, and should not be in conflict with any prior right of another.
 
Copyright. Copyright in the PRC, including copyrighted software, is principally protected under the Copyright Law of the PRC and related rules and regulations. Under the Copyright Law, the term of protection for copyrighted software is 50 years.
 
Trademark. Registered trademarks are protected under the Trademark Law of the PRC and related rules and regulations. Trademarks are registered with the Trademark Office of the SAIC. Where registration is sought for a trademark that is identical or similar to another trademark which has already been registered or given preliminary examination and approval for use in the same or similar category of commodities or services, the application for registration of such trademark may be rejected. Trademark registrations are effective for a renewable ten-year period, unless otherwise revoked. The duration of a trademark is 10 years from the date of registration.
 
Domain names. Domain name registrations are handled through domain name service agencies established under the relevant regulations, and applicants become domain name holders upon successful registration.
 
Regulations on Tax
 
PRC Corporate Income Tax
 
The PRC corporate income tax, or CIT, is calculated based on the taxable income determined under the applicable CIT Law and its implementation rules, which became effective on January 1, 2008 and amended on February 24, 2017. The CIT Law imposes a uniform corporate income tax rate of 25% on all resident enterprises in China, including foreign-invested enterprises.
 
Uncertainties exist with respect to how the CIT Law applies to the tax residence status of The Company and our offshore subsidiaries. Under the CIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with a “de facto management body” within China is considered a “resident enterprise,” which means that it is treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for corporate income tax purposes. Although the implementation rules of the CIT Law define “de facto management body” as a managing body that exercises substantive and overall management and control over the production and business, personnel, accounting books and assets of an enterprise, the only official guidance for this definition currently available is set forth in Circular 82 issued by the State Administration of Taxation, which provides guidance on the determination of the tax residence status of a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise, defined as an enterprise that is incorporated under the laws of a foreign country or territory and that has a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as its primary controlling shareholder. Although the Company does not have a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as our primary controlling shareholder and is therefore not a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise within the meaning of Circular 82, in the absence of guidance specifically applicable to us, we have applied the guidance set forth in Circular 82 to evaluate the tax residence status of The Company and our subsidiaries organized outside the PRC.
 
According to Circular 82, a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having a “de facto management body” in China and will be subject to PRC corporate income tax on its worldwide income only if all of the following criteria are met:
 

● | the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
14

 


● | decisions relating to the enterprise’s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the enterprise’s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholders meeting minutes are located or maintained in the PRC; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 50% or more of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We do not believe that we meet any of the conditions outlined in the immediately preceding paragraph.
 
We believe none of our entities outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term “de facto management body.” As all of our management members are based in China, it remains unclear how the tax residency rule will apply to our case. If the PRC tax authorities determine that we or any of our subsidiaries outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, then we or such subsidiary could be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 25% on its world-wide income, which could materially reduce our net income. In addition, we will also be subject to PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. Furthermore, if the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, gains realized on the sale or other disposition of our ordinary shares may be subject to PRC tax, at a rate of 10% in the case of non-PRC enterprises or 20% in the case of non-PRC individuals (in each case, subject to the provisions of any applicable tax treaty), if such gains are deemed to be from PRC sources. It is unclear whether non-PRC shareholders of our company would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise. Any such tax may reduce the returns on your investment in our ordinary shares.
 
Value-Added Tax and Business Tax
 
In November 2011, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the Pilot Plan for Imposition of Value-Added Tax to Replace Business Tax. In May and December 2013 and April 2014, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation promulgated Circular 37, Circular 106 and Circular 43 to further expand the scope of services which are to be subject to Value-Added Tax, or VAT, instead of business tax. Pursuant to these tax rules, from August 1, 2013, VAT will be imposed to replace the business tax in certain service industries, including technology services and advertising services, on a nationwide basis. The VAT rate shall be 17% for sale or importation of goods by a taxpayer. But, unlike business tax, a taxpayer is allowed to offset the qualified input VAT paid on taxable purchases against the output VAT chargeable on the revenue from services provided.
 
Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange and Dividend Distribution
 
Foreign Exchange Regulation
 
The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations. Under the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, may be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. By contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans or foreign currency is to be remitted into China under the capital account, such as a capital increase or foreign currency loans to our PRC subsidiaries.
 
15

 

In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment. Pursuant to this circular, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts, such as pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts, the reinvestment of RMB proceeds by foreign investors in the PRC, and remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval or verification of SAFE, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not possible previously. In addition, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over direct investment by foreign investors in the PRC shall be conducted by way of registration and banks shall process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in the PRC based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches.
 
We typically do not need to use our offshore foreign currency to fund our PRC operations. In the event we need to do so, we will apply to obtain the relevant approvals of SAFE and other PRC government authorities as necessary.
 
SAFE Circular 37
 
SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, on July 4, 2014, which replaced the former circular commonly known as “SAFE Circular 75” promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents’ legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a “special purpose vehicle.” SAFE Circular 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Furthermore, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange controls.
 
We have notified substantial beneficial owners of ordinary shares who we know are PRC residents of their filing obligation. However, we may not be aware of the identities of all our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. In addition, we do not have control over our beneficial owners and cannot assure you that all of our PRC resident beneficial owners will comply with SAFE Circular 37. The failure of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents to register or amend their SAFE registrations in a timely manner pursuant to SAFE Circular 37 or the failure of future beneficial owners of our company who are PRC residents to comply with the registration procedures set forth in SAFE Circular 37 may subject such beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiaries to fines and legal sanctions. Failure to register or amend the registration may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital to our PRC subsidiaries or receive dividends or other distributions from our PRC subsidiaries or other proceeds from disposal of our PRC subsidiaries, or we may be penalized by SAFE.
 
Share Option Rules
 
Under the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control issued by the PBOC on December 25, 2006, all foreign exchange matters involved in employee share ownership plans and share option plans in which PRC citizens participate require approval from SAFE or its authorized branch. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who participate in share incentive plans in overseas non-publicly-listed companies may submit applications to SAFE or its local branches for the foreign exchange registration with respect to offshore special purpose companies. In addition, under the Notices on Issues concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Share Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly-Listed Companies, or the Share Option Rules, issued by SAFE on February 15, 2012, PRC residents who are granted shares or share options by companies listed on overseas stock exchanges under share incentive plans are required to (i) register with SAFE or its local branches, (ii) retain a qualified PRC agent, which may be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas listed company or another qualified institution selected by the PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the share incentive plans on behalf of the participants, and (iii) retain an overseas institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of share options, purchase and sale of shares or interests and funds transfers. We will make efforts to comply with these requirements upon completion of our initial public offering.

Regulation of Dividend Distribution
 
The principal laws, rules and regulations governing dividend distribution by foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC are the Company Law of the PRC, as amended, the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law and its implementation regulations and the Chinese-foreign Equity Joint Venture Law and its implementation regulations. Under these laws, rules and regulations, foreign-invested enterprises may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Both PRC domestic companies and wholly-foreign owned PRC enterprises are required to set aside as general reserves at least 10% of their after-tax profit, until the cumulative amount of such reserves reaches 50% of their registered capital. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year.
Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, Sunlong may be involved in various claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Neither Wuhan Host nor Jiangsu Ronghai is currently a party to any such claims or proceedings which, if decided adversely to the Company, would either, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2019, Shengrong WFOE, Wuhan Host and Jiangsu Ronghai had 35, 42, 11, respectively, full-time employees.
 
We have not experienced any significant labor disputes and consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement.
 
We have established an employee welfare plan in accordance with the relevant PRC laws and regulations. Our total expenses for this plan were approximately $19,566 and $13,339 in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
As we continue to expand our business, we believe it is critical to hire and retain top talent, especially in the areas of marketing and technology engineering. We believe we have the ability to attract and retain high quality engineering talent in China based on our competitive salaries, annual performance-based bonus system, and equity incentive program for senior employees and executives. In addition, we have a training program for entry-level engineers that allows them to work closely with an experienced mentor to gain valuable hands-on experience and provide other professional development opportunities, including seminars where experienced engineers give lectures on specific engineering topics and new methods that can be applied to various projects.
