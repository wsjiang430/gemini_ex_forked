OVERVIEW
We are a biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing novel gene and cell therapies and vaccines that improve health and offer hope for patients across the globe.
Our cutting-edge technology pipeline includes:
•Modifier Gene Therapy Platform — Based on the use of nuclear hormone receptors ("NHRs"), we believe our modifier gene therapy platform has the potential to address many retinal diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa ("RP"), Leber congenital amaurosis ("LCA"), dry age-related macular degeneration ("AMD"), and Stargardt disease, with a single mutation-agnostic therapy.
•Regenerative Medicine Cell Therapy Platform — Our Phase 3-ready regenerative medicine cell therapy platform technology, NeoCart (autologous chondrocyte-derived neocartilage), is being developed for the repair of knee cartilage injuries in adults.
•Vaccines — COVAXIN is our whole-virion inactivated intramuscular COVID-19 vaccine candidate, which we are developing for the North American market. We are also developing a novel inhaled mucosal vaccine platform, which includes OCU500, a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine; OCU510, a seasonal quadrivalent flu vaccine; and OCU520, a combination quadrivalent seasonal flu and bivalent COVID-19 vaccine.
•Novel Biologic Therapy for Retinal Diseases — OCU200 is a novel fusion protein containing parts of human tumstatin and transferrin. OCU200 is designed to treat diabetic macular edema ("DME"), diabetic retinopathy ("DR"), and wet AMD.
Modifier Gene Therapy Platform
We are developing a modifier gene therapy platform designed to fulfill unmet medical needs related to retinal diseases, including inherited retinal diseases ("IRDs"), such as RP, LCA, and Stargardt disease, as well as dry AMD. Our modifier gene therapy platform is based on the use of NHRs, which have the potential to restore homeostasis — the basic biological processes in the retina. Unlike single-gene replacement therapies, which only target one genetic mutation, we believe that our modifier gene therapy platform, through its use of NHRs, represents a novel approach that has the potential to address multiple retinal diseases caused by mutations in multiple genes with one product, and potentially address complex diseases that are potentially caused by imbalances in multiple gene networks. OCU400, our first product candidate in our modifier gene therapy platform, has received Orphan Drug Designation ("ODD") from the FDA for nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group E member 3 ("NR2E3")-related RP and LCA and Orphan Medicinal Product Designation ("OMPD") from the European Commission ("EC"), based on the recommendation of the European Medicines Agency ("EMA"), for RP and LCA. These ODD and OMPD designations represent gene-agnostic broad coverage for RP and LCA, and are not mutation-specific designations.
We are conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to assess the safety of unilateral subretinal administration of OCU400 in patients with NR2E3 and rhodopsin ("RHO")-related RP and centrosomal protein 290 ("CEP290")-related LCA in the United States. We have completed dosing patients with RP in the dose-escalation portion of the clinical trial, which enrolled 10 subjects to receive a low, medium, or high dose of OCU400 in the subretinal space. We are continuing to enroll subjects with RP and LCA in this clinical trial to receive the high dose, which was determined to be the maximum tolerable dose from the dose-escalation portion of the clinical trial. We intend to initiate a Phase 1/2 pediatric clinical trial for OCU400 for the treatment of RP and LCA in the second quarter of 2023 and a Phase 3 clinical trial for OCU400 for the treatment of RP and LCA near the end of 2023, subject to discussions with the FDA.
We are also developing OCU410 and OCU410ST to utilize the nuclear receptor genes RAR-related orphan receptor A ("RORA") for the treatment of dry AMD and Stargardt disease, respectively. We are currently executing IND-enabling studies and we intend to submit IND applications in the second quarter of 2023 to initiate Phase 1/2 clinical trials.
Regenerative Medicine Cell Therapy Platform
NeoCart is a Phase 3-ready, regenerative medicine cell therapy technology that combines breakthroughs in bioengineering and cell processing to enhance the autologous cartilage repair process. NeoCart is a three-dimensional tissue-engineered disc of new cartilage that is manufactured by growing chondrocytes, the cells responsible for maintaining cartilage health. The chondrocytes

are derived from the patient on a unique scaffold. In this therapy, healthy cartilage tissue is grown and implanted in the patient. We believe NeoCart has the potential to accelerate healing and reduce pain by reconstructing a patient's previously damaged knee cartilage. It is designed to treat pain at the source, improve function, and potentially prevent a patient's progression to osteoarthritis ("OA"). The FDA granted a regenerative medicine advanced therapy ("RMAT") designation to NeoCart for the repair of full-thickness lesions of knee cartilage injuries in adults. We have received concurrence from the FDA on the confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial design. We are renovating an existing facility into a current GMP facility in accordance with the FDA's regulations in support of NeoCart manufacturing for Phase 3 clinical trial material. We intend to initiate the Phase 3 clinical trial in the first half of 2024, subject to discussions with the FDA.
Vaccines
Intramuscular COVID-19 Vaccine
We have a Co-Development, Supply and Commercialization Agreement with Bharat Biotech (as amended, the "Covaxin Agreement"), pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive right and license under certain of Bharat Biotech's intellectual property rights, with the right to grant sublicenses, to develop, manufacture, and commercialize COVAXIN for the prevention of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, in the United States, its territories, and possessions, Canada, and Mexico (the "Ocugen Covaxin Territory"). COVAXIN is intended for administration into the deltoid muscle of the upper arm, in two doses occurring 28 days apart. 
A Phase 3 clinical trial conducted by Bharat Biotech in India in 25,798 adults, ages 18 years and older, who were healthy or had stable chronic medical conditions reported an overall estimated vaccine efficacy of COVAXIN against COVID-19 of 77.8%, with efficacy against severe COVID-19 of 93.4%. In January 2023, we announced top-line results from our Phase 2/3 immuno-bridging and broadening clinical trial in the United States evaluating COVAXIN for adults ages 18 years and older. The clinical trial was designed to evaluate whether the immune response observed in participants in Bharat Biotech's Phase 3 clinical trial in India is similar to a demographically representative, adult population in the United States. The clinical trial met both co-primary immunogenicity endpoints and no serious adverse events ("SAEs") related to COVAXIN were identified. We additionally plan to work with government agencies in the United States to obtain funding in order to comply with the requirements of a Biologics License Application ("BLA") submission, including funding to initiate an adult safety clinical trial subject to discussions with the FDA.
In July 2021, we completed our rolling submission to Health Canada for COVAXIN. The rolling submission process, which was conducted through our Canadian subsidiary, Vaccigen Ltd. ("Vaccigen"), was recommended and accepted under the Minister of Health's Interim Order Respecting the Importation, Sale and Advertising of Drugs for Use in Relation to COVID-19 ("Interim Order") and transitioned to a New Drug Submission ("NDS") for COVID-19. In August 2022, we withdrew our NDS based on discussions with Health Canada and are evaluating the requirements for resubmitting an updated NDS. In Mexico, the Comisión Federal para la Protección contra Riesgos Sanitarios ("COFEPRIS") authorized emergency use for COVAXIN for adults ages 18 years and older, which remains active. We are in discussions with Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología in Mexico ("CONACYT") regarding our submission for emergency use authorization ("EUA") for COVAXIN for pediatric use in ages five to 18 years.
Inhaled Mucosal Vaccines
In September 2022, we entered into an exclusive license agreement ("WU License Agreement") with The Washington University in St. Louis ("Washington University"), pursuant to which we obtained the rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize an inhaled mucosal COVID-19 vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 in the United States, Europe, and Japan. The WU License Agreement was amended in January 2023 to add the countries of South Korea, Australia, and China to the territory rights (together with the United States, Europe, and Japan, the "Mucosal Vaccine Territory"). Utilizing these rights, we are developing a novel inhaled mucosal vaccine platform, which includes OCU500, a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine; OCU510, a seasonal quadrivalent flu vaccine; and OCU520, a combination quadrivalent seasonal flu and bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. As these vaccine candidates are being developed to be administered through inhalation, we believe they have the potential to generate rapid local immunity in the upper airways and lungs where viruses enter and infect the body, which we believe may help reduce or prevent infection and transmission as well as provide protection against new virus variants. OCU510 is being developed for the global market. We intend to initiate IND-enabling studies and work closely with government agencies to obtain funding for the development of these inhaled mucosal vaccines.

Novel Biologic Therapy for Retinal Diseases
We are developing OCU200, which is a novel fusion protein containing parts of human tumstatin and transferrin. OCU200 is designed to treat DME, DR, and wet AMD. We have completed the technology transfer of manufacturing processes to our contract development and manufacturing organization ("CDMO") and have produced clinical trial materials to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial. We submitted an IND application to the FDA in February 2023 to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial targeting DME.
OUR STRATEGY
We are developing novel solutions to medical challenges and approaching healthcare innovation with purpose and agility to deliver new options for people facing serious diseases and conditions. Our product candidates have the potential to cure blindness diseases, treat serious conditions such as articular cartilage lesions, reduce the transmission of COVID-19, and make a significant impact in the ever-evolving COVID-19 landscape. Key elements of the strategy we employ to accomplish this mission include:
•Continuing to advance our modifier gene therapy platform into and through clinical development.
We are developing our modifier gene therapy platform, inclusive of OCU400, OCU410, and OCU410ST, for the treatment of multiple IRDs, including RP, LCA, and Stargardt disease, as well as dry AMD. We are continuing to enroll patients in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for OCU400 for the treatment of RP and LCA and have completed dosing patients in the dose-escalation portion of this clinical trial. We intend to initiate a Phase 1/2 pediatric clinical trial for OCU400 for the treatment of RP and LCA in the second quarter of 2023 and a Phase 3 clinical trial for OCU400 for the treatment of RP and LCA near the end of 2023, subject to discussions with the FDA. We are executing IND-enabling studies for OCU410 and OCU410ST and we intend to submit IND applications in the second quarter of 2023 to initiate Phase 1/2 clinical trials.
•Expanding and exploring partnerships with current and future key collaborators and commercial partners to maximize patient access, global reach, and the value of our product candidates.
We intend to explore strategic licensing, acquisition, and collaboration opportunities with qualified partners to maximize the potential benefit of our product candidates on patients globally and to expand our product candidate pipeline to support our future growth.
•Obtaining government funding to advance our vaccine programs towards commercialization.
We are developing a novel inhaled mucosal vaccine platform, which includes OCU500, a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine; OCU510, a seasonal quadrivalent flu vaccine; and OCU520, a combination quadrivalent seasonal flu and bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. We obtained the rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize an inhaled mucosal COVID-19 vaccine in the Mucosal Vaccine Territory from Washington University. We are developing the seasonal flu component of this inhaled mucosal vaccine platform internally. As these mucosal vaccine candidates are being developed to be administered through inhalation, we believe they have the potential to generate rapid local immunity in the upper airways and lungs where viruses enter and infect the body, which is particularly important during times of peak transmission. OCU520, our combination quadrivalent seasonal flu and bivalent COVID-19 vaccine, is designed to provide the unique ease of getting both an annual COVID-19 booster vaccine and an annual seasonal flu vaccine in one vaccine.
We also announced top-line results from our Phase 2/3 immuno-bridging and broadening clinical trial in the United States evaluating COVAXIN for adults ages 18 years and older. The Phase 2/3 clinical trial met both co-primary immunogenicity endpoints and no SAEs related to COVAXIN were identified. COVAXIN is formulated with the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus, an antigen, and an adjuvant, which is a common approach to vaccine design. Accordingly, COVAXIN represents an important additional vaccine option for individuals that are looking for a well-established approach to vaccine development and manufacturing as well as a vaccine that elicits robust cellular immune memory to SARS-CoV-2.
We intend to work closely with government agencies to obtain funding to initiate clinical trials to support the regulatory submissions for these vaccines in their respective territories.
•Advancing the clinical development of our regenerative medicine platform towards market authorization and developing in-house manufacturing capability.
We are developing NeoCart, our regenerative medicine platform technology for the repair of knee cartilage injuries in adults. We have received concurrence from the FDA on the confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial design. We are renovating an existing facility into a current GMP facility in accordance with the FDA's regulations in support of

OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATE PIPELINE
Our product candidate pipeline is summarized in the following chart:
OUR MODIFIER GENE THERAPY PLATFORM AND GENE THERAPY PRODUCT CANDIDATES
We are developing our modifier gene therapy platform, inclusive of OCU400, OCU410, and OCU410ST for the treatment of multiple IRDs, such as RP, LCA, and Stargardt disease, as well as dry AMD. Our modifier gene therapy platform is a cutting-edge technology licensed from SERI, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School, and involves the targeted delivery and expression of one or more NHRs in the disease tissues and is designed to introduce a functional gene to modify the expression of multiple genes and gene-networks, which potentially enables it to address multiple retinal diseases with one product.
Modifier Gene Therapy Platform Based on the Use of NHRs
NHRs are intracellular receptors that regulate gene expression, acting as master regulator genes in the retina. NHRs play a vital role in regulating retinal cell development, maturation, metabolism, visual cycle function, survival, and maintaining the cellular and molecular homeostasis in retinal tissues. Our modifier gene therapy platform is designed to target NHRs to potentially provide therapeutic benefit to patients suffering from genetically diverse IRDs. The use of genetic modifiers represent a broadened means of potentially treating a variety of retinal degenerative diseases, as compared to single-gene replacement therapy. While single-gene replacement therapies have shown tremendous promise in rare retinal diseases, they are highly specific and cannot improve a multitude of disease-causing genetic defects. Our modifier gene therapy platform has the potential to restore retinal integrity and function across a range of genetically diverse IRDs and other degenerative retinal diseases providing us with significant potential long-term value.
Our modifier gene therapy platform encompasses the targeted delivery and expression of certain NHRs that are expressed naturally in retinal tissue. Preclinical studies have shown that NR2E3, a member of the NHR family, is a dual activator and repressor that, with other transcription factors, modulates cell fate and differentiation of rod and cone photoreceptor cells, specialized cells for detecting light, in the eye. Disease outcome is a result of a primary mutation as well as modifier alleles. NR2E3 is a master regulator of several key pathways in retinal development and function. NR2E3 potentially prevents and rescues degenerating retina by resetting the homeostatic state of key gene networks in the presence of a primary mutation.
The delivery of Nr2e3 in a mouse lacking a functional Nr2e3 gene restored the retina structure and function. We believe that NR2E3 may partially or fully rescue photoreceptors from degeneration in patients with IRDs and improve patients' vision. It 
Table of Contents

was also demonstrated preclinically that RORA offers a protective allele in AMD where the loss of photoreceptor cells leads to blindness. NR2E3 regulates the expression of both Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1 Group D Member 1 ("NR1D1") and RORA. Thus, the nuclear receptors work in overlapping networks to modulate normal retinal development and function. These receptors impact gene expression of hundreds of genes and numerous networks and, as such, may be potent modifiers of retinal disease and degeneration.
Results of Preclinical Studies Support the Potential Efficacy of NR2E3 Modifier Gene Therapy
The efficacy of Nr2e3 was evaluated in five unique mouse models of IRDs in which treatment with the adeno-associated viral ("AAV")8-Nr2e3 gene by subretinal injection effectively rescued multiple genetically diverse IRDs by protecting photoreceptors from further damage after disease onset. These models represent a heterogeneous group of diseases in humans and are relevant in establishing the modifier role of NR2E3. The five IRD models evaluated were: FVB-Pde6ß rd1/NJ ("rd1"), Rhodopsin null allele ("Rho−/−"), B6.129S6(Cg)-Rhotm1.1Kpal/J ("RhoP23H"), BXD24/TyJ-Cep290rd16/J ("rd16"), and Nr2e3rd7/J ("rd7"). rd1 is PDE6β-associated RP, Rho−/− and RhoP23H are both RHO-associated RP, rd16 is LCA, and rd7 is enhanced S-cone syndrome. C57BL6/J ("B6") in these models represents the control. The results were evaluated using fundus imaging, electroretinogram ("ERG"), histology, and immunostaining of retinal layers. This preclinical data was published in Nature Gene Therapy.
This study showed that the administration of AAV8-Nr2e3 therapy improved clinical, histological, functional, and molecular disease outcomes in each of the five models of IRDs. These studies demonstrated that the mechanism of Nr2e3 therapy involves resetting key retinal transcription factors and key biological networks that work in concert with Nr2e3 to modulate the homeostatic state of the retina. The study is based on the principle that disease outcome is rarely due to a single gene mutation; rather, it is a result of the combinatorial mutational load on the biological system, which is often strongly influenced by other factors such as modifier genes. The models demonstrate the potential potency of a novel modifier gene therapy to elicit broad-spectrum therapeutic benefits in early (Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 4) and advanced stages (Figure 1, Figure 3, and Figure 5) of IRDs and serve as a broad-spectrum gene therapy to reduce retinal degeneration.
Figure 1: AAV8-Nr2e3 outer nuclear layer ("ONL") cell layer number in early stage rescue and advanced stage rescue in IRD mouse models.
Figure 1 displays the cell layer numbers of the ONL from AAV8-Nr2e3 treated and untreated mice in different early stage and advanced stage IRD models. These ONL photoreceptors induce phototransduction in the retina and thereby initiate the vision

process. The normal mouse retina is comprised of 10 to 12 layers of rod and cone photoreceptor nuclei in the ONL. rd1 retinas showed a profound rescue of photoreceptor cells (six to eight layers of ONL in early stage rescue IRD models) compared to the untreated eyes. Rho−/−, RhoP23H, and rd16 mice showed a more moderate increase (three to six layers of ONL in early stage rescue IRD models) compared to the untreated eyes of each model. ONL cell layer numbers in the rd7 model do not start degenerating until four to five months of age and as such is excluded from Figure 1 above. Although only partial rescue was observed in these models, results of research conducted by third parties suggests that retention of only a single layer of photoreceptor cells can maintain minimal visual function suggesting that an increase of even 20% is significant. In the advanced stage rescue IRD models, the results of which are depicted in the bottom half of Figure 1, improvement varied from ~30 to 80% of the retina in the Rho−/−, RhoP23H, and rd16 AAV8-Nr2e3 treated mice, depending on distribution efficiency throughout the retina. Approximately three to five layers of ONL cells were preserved in Nr2e3 treated mice compared with untreated mice that show less than or equal to one layer of ONL remaining. We believe Nr2e3 therapy has great promise in potentially restoring retinal development.
Figure 2: Fundus imaging of AAV8-Nr2e3 early-stage rescues in IRD mouse models.
Figure 2 displays the fundus imaging results from AAV8-Nr2e3 treated and untreated mice in different early stage IRD models. Although not all models have a clinical phenotype, considerable improvements were observed in the fundus of RhoP23H, rd16, and rd7 mice. The rd16 mice were observed to have a red fundus with increased and pronounced vessels and this fundus observation resolves with Nr2e3 administration. Improvement was observed in the rd7 phenotype, with reduction of retinal spots in AAV8-Nr2e3 treated eyes compared with untreated eyes.
Figure 3: Fundus imaging of AAV8-Nr2e3 advanced stage rescues in IRD mouse models.
Figure 3 displays the fundus imaging results from AAV8-Nr2e3 treated and untreated mice in different advanced stage IRD models. The fundus imaging shows the reduction of retinal degeneration in the AAV8-Nr2e3 treated eyes compared with untreated eyes.

Figure 4 displays the H/E staining results from AAV8-Nr2e3 treated and untreated mice in different early-stage IRD models. The H/E staining revealed that subretinal delivery of AAV8-Nr2e3 rescued photoreceptor cells and helped maintain retinal integrity of IRD retinas in all models. Additionally, the rd7 model presents with increased cone cells with whorls and rosettes in the ONL. These retinal whorls and rosettes, that are characteristics of the rd7 phenotype, resolved following Nr2e3 treatment, suggesting that the delivery of Nr2e3 can restore normal retinal development.
Figure 5: H/E staining of AAV8-Nr2e3 advanced stage rescues in IRD mouse models.
Figure 5 displays the H/E staining results from AAV8-Nr2e3 treated and untreated mice in different advanced stage IRD models. The H/E staining shows the reduction of retinal degeneration by Nr2e3 therapy in each model.
Improved ERG results were also observed in AAV8-Nr2e3 treated IRD retinas in addition to the above results that displayed the rescue of ONL layers, improvement in fundus imaging, and improvement in H/E staining. Human vision is enabled by three primary modes: scotopic vision, photopic vision, and mesopic vision. Scotopic vision is monochromatic vision in very low light, which functions primarily due to rod cells in the eye. Photopic vision is vision under well-lit conditions, which provides for color perception and functions primarily due to cone cells in the eye. Mesopic vision is a combination of scotopic and photopic vision in low lighting, which functions due to a combination of rod and cone cells in the eye. IRD disease progression results in the loss of rod and cone function that is assessed by abnormal ERG responses. In the below study, the visual function of Nr2e3 treated IRD retinas was examined in four out of five IRD strains, excluding rd7, by recording scotopic and photopic ERGs to evaluate rod- and cone-driven responses. Treated mice showed improvement in retinal ERG signal, both in scotopic and photopic conditions (Figure 6).

Analysis B above displays the percent increase in ERG B-wave responses in the treated IRD models.
Results of Preclinical Studies Support the Safety of NR2E3
The safety of Nr2e3 was evaluated in healthy mice following subretinal administration. B6 mice were treated with AAV8-Nr2e3-green fluorescent protein ("GFP") fusion construct at post-natal day zero and evaluated after both seven days and one month for any toxic effect as well as expression of Nr2e3-GFP fusion protein in the retina. The expression of the Nr2e3 protein in a mouse retina did not show any detrimental effect on retinal cells, including photoreceptors (Figure 7). Also, there was no difference in retinal anatomy as indicated by fundus, histology (the cell layers), expression of opsin and rhodopsin proteins (immunohistochemistry), and retinal function (as indicated by ERG recording) between treated and untreated mice (Figure 7). Expression of enhanced GFP-Nr2e3 fusion protein was observed at post-natal day 30 in treated animals. In this preclinical study, overexpression of the Nr2e3 protein following subretinal injection of AAV8-Nr2e3 was well-tolerated.

The analysis in Figure 7 above utilized a population size of five mice and displays the B6 control AAV8-Nr2e3 treated mice showing no abnormalities.

Analysis C above

displays the GFP label of AAV8-Nr2e3-GFP injected at post-natal zero with GFP expression assessed at both post-natal day seven and post-natal day 30.
Additionally, Nr2e3 has also been shown to function with other transcription factors such as Nr1d1, neural retinal leucine zipper ("Nrl"), Cone-rod homeobox ("Crx"), Rora, and thyroid receptor beta ("Thrb") to modulate photoreceptor cell fate and retinal function as an activator or suppressor of gene expression. The expression level of five other essential retinal transcription factors (Nr1d1, Nrl, Crx, Rora, and Thrb) were determined in Nr2e3 treated and untreated retinas. Overall, a significant decrease in expression of key retinal transcription factors was reversed following Nr2e3 therapy (Figure 8).

The analysis in Figure 8 above shows the relative expression levels of Nr2e3, Nrl, Rora, Thrb, Nr1d1, and Crx at post-natal day 30 Nr2e3 treated mutant strains (rd7, Rho−/−, RhoP23H, and rd16) and rd1 at post-natal day 7 compared with the corresponding untreated controls and normalized to beta-actin.
Overview of RP and LCA and Current Treatment Options
IRDs are caused by genetic mutations that are passed down within families and lead to progressive disease, severe visual impairment, and blindness. They are a diverse disease class with large phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. IRDs are a common cause of irreversible blindness due to retinal cell degeneration. Treating these conditions has been a significant challenge due to the sheer volume of potential therapeutic gene targets. Gene replacement therapy is a promising approach to provide sustained restoration of normal retinal function for a mutated gene, but such therapies can only address one gene at a time, limiting their potential therapeutic use. Developing a custom gene therapy for each of the more than 125 mutated genes linked to RP and LCA would not only be expensive but also may not be possible due to size, class, or localization that will impact delivery of the gene. Not all genes and disease expressions are amenable to gene therapy. For example, the genetic mutations of approximately 40% of RP patients remain unknown with few or no known therapeutic options available. Modifier gene therapy to ameliorate multiple forms of RP and LCA without requiring knowledge of the mutated gene, may provide a potentially robust and feasible treatment for RP and LCA.
RP and LCA are the most common IRDs involving photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium ("RPE"). RP is a group of rare, genetic disorders that involve a breakdown and loss of cells in the retina. RP affects approximately 110,000 and 190,000 individuals in the United States and Europe, respectively. In RP, progressive retinal degeneration starts in the mid-periphery and advances toward the macula and the fovea. The fovea is the part of the retina that is responsible for sharp central vision. Common symptoms of RP include difficulty seeing in poor lighting or in the dark, loss of central vision or side (peripheral) vision, and difficulty reading print and deciphering detailed images. RP is associated with over 100 mutated genes that affect 
Table of Contents

1.5 million individuals worldwide. RP is heterogeneous and varies greatly in age of onset, rate of progression, and even genetic etiology, yet a common pathology of photoreceptor cell degeneration develops.
There is currently no approved treatment that slows or stops the progression of multiple forms of RP. Proposed treatments for RP include gene-replacement therapy, retinal implant devices, retinal transplantation, stem cells, vitamin therapy, and other pharmacological treatments. While gene-replacement therapies may provide a new functional gene, they do not necessarily eliminate the underlying genetic defect, which may still cause stress and toxic effects. Therefore, the development of gene specific replacement therapy is highly challenging, especially when multiple and unknown genes are involved.
Similar to RP, minimal treatment options are available for LCA, which is a group of IRDs characterized by severe impairment of vision or blindness at birth. LCA affects approximately 15,000 and 18,000 individuals in the United States and Europe, respectively. It is an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, wherein both parents, called carriers, have one mutated copy of the gene and one normal gene. They are unaffected carriers of LCA. However, each of their children has a 25% chance of inheriting the two LCA gene copies (one from each parent) needed to cause the disorder. LCA is caused by a degeneration and/or dysfunction of photoreceptor rod cells and cone cells in the eye. This affects the processing of electrical signals. The electrical signals travel from the retina through the optic nerve to the brain. The brain then turns the signals into images that are seen. The less electrical activity there is, the less sight one will have. Electroretinography is used to measure the electrical signals in the retina. Common symptoms of LCA include a child habitually pressing their eyes, formations of cataracts, thinning and gradual decline of the cornea which bulges outward into a cone shape. In some cases, the eyes of individuals with LCA can appear sunken. LCA is associated with over 25 mutated genes and affects approximately 160,000 individuals worldwide. Luxturna, developed by Spark Therapeutics, Inc., has been approved by the FDA to treat IRDs caused by retinoid isomerohydrolase ("RPE65") gene mutations. The RPE65 gene represents just one of more than 125 mutated genes linked to RP and LCA. No treatment options have been approved by the FDA for RP and LCA caused by mutations in other RP and LCA causing genes.
OCU400 for IRDs
OCU400 is our first product candidate being developed with our modifier gene therapy platform. OCU400 has the potential to restore retinal integrity and function across a range of genetically diverse IRDs. OCU400 consists of a functional copy of the retina-specific NHR gene, NR2E3, delivered to target cells in the retina using an AAV5 vector that has the potential to be used as a gene therapeutic not only for the treatment of retinal diseases associated with mutations in genes such as NR2E3, RHO, CEP290, and PDE6ß, but also other gene mutations associated with IRDs, including RP and LCA. As a potent modifier gene, expression of NR2E3 may help reset retinal cell homeostasis, metabolism, and visual cycle function (Figure 9). OCU400 has received ODD for NR2E3-related RP and LCA and OMPD from the EC, based on the recommendation of the EMA, for RP and LCA. We believe these broad ODD and OMPD designations demonstrate that OCU400 has the potential to be a broad-spectrum therapeutic to treat multiple IRDs. These ODD and OMPD designations represent gene-agnostic broad coverage for RP and LCA, and are not mutation-specific designations. OCU400 had previously received ODDs from the FDA for the treatment of the following disease genotypes: NR2E3, RHO, CEP290, and PDE6ß mutation-associated inherited retinal degenerations.
Figure 9: Mechanism of our modifier gene therapy.
Figure 9 demonstrates the mechanism of our modifier gene therapy. In single-gene replacement therapies such as gene augmentation, only the non-functional gene is targeted. and accordingly, this therapy cannot improve a multitude of disease-causing genetic defects. In our modifier gene therapy platform, a functional gene of the retina-specific NHR gene, NR2E3, is introduced to modify the expression of many genes and gene networks and restore homeostasis.

As previously described, in five unique mouse models of IRDs, treatment with AAV8-Nr2e3 by subretinal injection rescued multiple genetically diverse IRDs by protecting photoreceptors from further damage after disease onset. This result demonstrates the potential potency of a novel modifier gene therapy to elicit broad-spectrum therapeutic benefits in early and advanced stages of IRDs. We are conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, a multicenter, open-label, dose ranging study to assess the safety of unilateral subretinal administration of OCU400 in patients with NR2E3 and RHO-related RP and CEP290-related LCA in the United States. We have completed dosing patients with RP in the dose-escalation portion of the clinical trial, which enrolled 10 subjects to receive a low, medium, or high dose of OCU400 in the subretinal space. We are continuing to enroll subjects with RP and LCA in this clinical trial to receive the high dose, which was determined to be the maximum tolerable dose from the dose-escalation portion of the clinical trial. We intend to initiate a Phase 1/2 pediatric clinical trial for OCU400 for the treatment of RP and LCA in the second quarter of 2023 and a Phase 3 clinical trial for OCU400 for the treatment of RP and LCA near the end of 2023, subject to discussions with the FDA.
Overview of Dry AMD and Stargardt Disease and Current Treatment Options
AMD is attributed to the thinning of the macula of the retina, which leads to impairment and loss of central vision. The macula is the part of the retina responsible for clear vision in one's direct line of sight. AMD is characterized by the thickening and loss of normal architecture within the Bruch's membrane, lipofuscin accumulation in the RPE, and drusen formation beneath the RPE in the Bruch's membrane. These deposits consist of complement components, other inflammatory molecules, lipids, lipoproteins B and E, and glycoproteins. Common risk factors for AMD include genetics, smoking, nutrition and vitamin deficiency, and heart disease. Dry AMD, which affects over 266 million individuals worldwide, involves the slow deterioration of the retina with submacular drusen (small white or yellow dots on the retina), atrophy, loss of macular function, and central vision impairment. Common symptoms of dry AMD include visual distortions, reduced central vision in one or both eyes, increased difficulty adapting to low levels of light, and a well-defined blind spot in one's field of vision. 
Similarly, Stargardt disease is a rare genetic eye disorder that causes retinal degeneration and ultimately leads to loss of central vision. It is the most common form of inherited macular degeneration, affecting approximately 0.8 million individuals worldwide. Stargardt disease happens when lipofuscin, a fatty yellow pigment, accumulates on the macula, which leads to the degeneration of the photoreceptor cells in the macula and ultimately leads to progressive central vision loss. The photoreceptor cells convert light into electrical signals, which are then sent to the brain where they are processed to create the images we see. Stargardt disease is usually caused by mutations in the ABCA4 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This gene affects how one's body uses vitamin A. The body uses vitamin A to make cells in the retina. Common symptoms of Stargardt disease include gray, black, or hazy spots in one's central vision, sensitivity to light, increased time for eyes to adjust between light and dark places, color blindness, and gradual central vision loss in both eyes. Currently no treatment options exist to address dry AMD or reverse or slow the progression of Stargardt disease and accordingly, there remains a significant unmet medical need for these ocular diseases.
OCU410 and OCU410ST for the Treatment of Dry AMD and Stargardt Disease
We are developing OCU410 and OCU410ST for the treatment of dry AMD and Stargardt disease, respectively. OCU410 and OCU410ST utilize an AAV delivery platform for the retinal delivery of the RORA gene. RORA regulated gene networks are relevant in the treatment of dry AMD and Stargardt disease. RORA reduces oxidative stress, limits lipofuscin deposits, reduces chronic inflammation, and improves choroidal blood flow. Gene variants of the ABCA4 gene are associated with both AMD and Stargardt disease. Stargardt disease is usually caused by mutations in the ABCA4 gene. This gene transports oxidized retinol compounds from photoreceptors to RPE cells for detoxification. In mice models, ABCA4 -/- displayed low levels of CD59. A cell-surface glycoprotein, CD59, prevents the formation of the complement membrane attack complex. We are currently executing IND-enabling studies and we intend to submit IND applications in the second quarter of 2023 to initiate Phase 1/2 clinical trials.
NEOCART (AUTOLOGOUS CHONDROCYTE-DERIVED NEOCARTILAGE) CELL THERAPY PLATFORM
We diversified our innovative pipeline in 2022 by introducing NeoCart (autologous chondrocyte-derived neocartilage), a Phase 3-ready, regenerative medicine cell therapy technology that combines breakthroughs in bioengineering and cell processing to enhance the autologous cartilage repair process. We believe NeoCart has the potential to accelerate healing and reduce pain by reconstructing a patient's previously damaged knee cartilage. In May 2022, the FDA granted an RMAT designation to NeoCart for the repair of full-thickness lesions of knee cartilage injuries in adults.
The cartilage is a complex tissue which protects the various joints and bones in the human body. It acts as a shock absorber throughout the body withstanding significant pressure and allowing for joints to glide smoothly with minimal friction. Cartilage damage can be caused by acute trauma, such as a bad fall or a sports-related injury, or by repetitive trauma, such as general

wear over time. Unlike other tissues in the body, cartilage in the joints has no innate ability to repair itself, making any injury permanent. If left untreated, even a small defect can expand in size and progress to debilitating OA, ultimately requiring a joint replacement procedure. Over 528 million individuals worldwide are diagnosed with OA. This number is expected to increase as the population of aging yet active individuals and the rates of obesity increase.
We believe the current therapies available to treat cartilage damage in the knee are suboptimal with varying outcomes due to variable cellular responses. Chondroplasty is often recommended in patients with small cartilage lesions (between one and three cm2). This procedure is performed through small incisions on the sides of the knee with the aid of an arthroscope. During this procedure, the damaged cartilage is trimmed, and the remaining surface is smoothed. Microfracture surgery is a frequently used procedure for severe cartilage damage which yields varying outcomes from patient to patient. This surgery consists of the creation of tiny holes or "fractures" in the bone underneath the injured cartilage, leading to the formation of a blood clot in the affected area. The blood and bone marrow that form the blood clot contain stem cells, which are expected to grow into cartilage-building cells, as well as growth factors to support cell function and development of replacement cartilage matrix. Approximately 30% of patients that have undergone microfracture surgery continue to have pain and reduced knee function. Additionally, current therapies require extensive recovery time. They are often ineffective in the long term as they do not adequately address cartilage damage, which leads to additional corrective surgeries. Autologous culture chondrocytes on porcine collagen membrane (MACI) is used for the repair of symptomatic, single, or multiple full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee with or without bone involvement in adults less than 55 years of age. It is a three-by-five centimeter cellular sheet with a density of 500,000 cells per cm2.
The other options for cartilage repair include osteochondral autograft transplantation ("OAT"), osteochondral allograft resurfacing ("OCA"), and autologous chondrocyte implantation ("ACI"). During OAT, damaged cartilage is removed and replaced with healthy cartilage from a non-weight-bearing area of the joint. OAT is recommended for small to medium sized lesions (between 1.5 and four cm2) and is limited by the amount of donor tissue available, the need for open surgery, and donor site morbidity. OCA is a similar process to OAT except that the tissue is sourced from cadaveric donor bone and cartilage. OCA is recommended for large lesions (between four and 10 cm2) and can be performed in a single procedure but is limited by the availability of cadaveric tissue. ACI is a process where cartilage cells are harvested from a non-weight bearing part of the knee and are cultured in a laboratory. They are subsequently implanted into the injured area.
Over one million arthroscopies are performed annually as a procedure to diagnose and treat issues of the joint. Patients and physicians are in need of treatment options that offer more rapid and durable recovery compared to the current treatment options. The attributes of an optimal treatment for a damaged knee cartilage involve the reduction in pain, repair of the knee cartilage, rapid return to daily activities, durable response, and a non-opioid approach. We believe NeoCart would represent a better solution to treat cartilage damage in the knee as it has the potential to solve for the limitations of the current therapies and has the potential to provide improved efficacy, long-term patient benefits, accelerated patient recovery, and predictable patient outcomes.
NeoCart is designed to treat pain at the source, improve function, and potentially prevent a patient's progression to OA. NeoCart is a three-dimensional tissue-engineered disc of new cartilage that is manufactured by growing chondrocytes, the cells responsible for maintaining cartilage health. The chondrocytes are derived from the patient on a unique scaffold. In this therapy, the patient's cells are separated from a tissue biopsy specimen and multiplied in a manufacturing facility. The cells are then infused into the scaffold, which is a three-dimensional structure that enables the proper delivery, distribution, and organization of cells in their natural environment to support tissue formation. Before NeoCart is implanted in a patient, the patient's cells and the scaffold undergo a bioengineering process in a Tissue Engineering Processor ("TEP"). The TEP is designed to mimic the conditions inside a functional joint so that the tissue is prepared to begin functioning like normal healthy cartilage prior to implantation. Once NeoCart is ready to be implanted, a bioadhesive is used to anchor NeoCart at the site of cartilage injury and seal the implant to the surrounding native cartilage. The bioadhesive is a natural, biocompatible material which acts as adhesives for biological tissue, thereby eliminating the need for complicated suturing (Figure 10).

Figure 10: Mechanism of the regenerative medicine cell therapy technology, NeoCart.
Figure 10 demonstrates the mechanism of our regenerative medicine cell therapy technology, NeoCart. We believe NeoCart has the potential to accelerate healing and reduce pain by reconstructing a patient's previously damaged knee cartilage. In this therapy, healthy cartilage tissue is grown and implanted in the patient.
NeoCart was acquired in our reverse merger in 2019 with Histogenics Corporation ("Histogenics"). Prior to 2019, Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials were conducted to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of NeoCart. These clinical trials reported a decrease in pain and improved function of the knee. Additionally, per the results of the Phase 2 clinical trial, more patients responded to NeoCart than microfracture surgery. No SAEs were reported. A Phase 3 clinical trial was conducted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of NeoCart as compared to microfracture surgery to treat cartilage defects in the knee. This clinical trial enrolled 249 subjects between the ages of 18 and 59. The Phase 3 clinical trial of NeoCart narrowly missed the primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in pain and function in a dual threshold responder analysis one year after the treatment as compared to microfracture surgery.
We have received concurrence from the FDA on the confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial design. This study will be a randomized, controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NeoCart in comparison to the current standard of care, chondroplasty, in subjects with articular cartilage defects. We intend to initiate the Phase 3 clinical trial in the first half of 2024, subject to discussions with the FDA. Our Phase 3 clinical trial will use chondroplasty as the control instead of microfracture, which was used in the Phase 3 clinical trial conducted by Histogenics. Additionally, the Phase 3 clinical trial conducted by Histogenics used a responder analysis for the co-primary endpoint (as opposed to microfracture) that included an improvement of at least 12 points in outcome compared to baseline at one year on the knee injury and OA outcome score pain assessment test and an improvement of at least 20 points in outcome compared to baseline on the International Knee Documentation Committee subjective test. In contrast, our Phase 3 clinical trial will use a co-primary efficacy endpoint defined as the mean change from baseline (as opposed to chondroplasty) to two years for the patients' Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Pain and Function (Activities of Daily Living) subscale scales. Additionally, the Phase 3 clinical trial conducted by Histogenics enrolled patients with a total lesion size of less than six cm2, while our Phase 3 clinical trial will enroll patients with total lesion sizes between one to three cm2.
VACCINES
We are developing COVAXIN for the prevention of COVID-19 in the Ocugen Covaxin Territory. COVAXIN is a whole-virion inactivated, intramuscular COVID-19 vaccine candidate that is manufactured using a Vero cell manufacturing platform. COVAXIN was granted an Emergency Use Listing by the WHO in November 2021, has been authorized or approved for use in over 25 countries, and is accepted for travel purposes in over 85 countries. Additionally, COVAXIN has received EUA in India for children ages six to 18 years.

We are also developing a novel inhaled mucosal vaccine platform, which includes OCU500, a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine; OCU510, a seasonal quadrivalent flu vaccine; and OCU520, a combination quadrivalent seasonal flu and bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. OCU510 is being developed for the global market.
Overview of COVID-19
COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was first reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and was declared a global pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. COVID-19 is a highly transmissible disease that spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. In some circumstances, these respiratory droplets may contaminate surfaces they land on. Common symptoms of COVID-19 include cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever or chills, muscle or body aches, sore throat, congestion, or loss of taste or smell. Certain people are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 infection including those over the age of 65 and with underlying medical conditions, including cancer, diabetes, heart conditions, and obesity, along with many other underlying conditions. Those at increased risk for severe COVID-19 are more likely to be hospitalized, need intensive care, require a ventilator to help them breathe, or die. Since being discovered, new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged. New variants of a virus emerge when a mutation to the virus' genes occurs. SARS-CoV-2 and its variants have caused approximately over 756.5 million cases of COVID-19 and 6.8 million deaths, with the United States alone accounting for over 101.4 million cases and 1.1 million deaths. The Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) was identified in November 2021 and has continued to be deemed a variant of concern by the WHO due to at least one of the following characteristics: increase in transmissibility or detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology, an increase in virulence or change in clinical disease presentation, or a decrease in effectiveness of public health and social measures or available diagnostics, vaccines, or therapeutics. Since being identified, several sub-variants of the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) have been observed as the virus circulated at intense levels worldwide. Research suggests that the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) is more contagious and increases the risk of reinfection when compared to variants that were previously deemed to be variants of concern.
COVAXIN for the Prevention of COVID-19
COVAXIN is formulated with the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus, an antigen, and an adjuvant, which is a common approach to vaccine design. COVAXIN is designed to utilize the whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus to trigger the immune response to create antibodies against multiple antigens. Inactivated vaccines do not replicate and are therefore unlikely to revert and cause pathological effects. COVAXIN has an antigen concentration of six micrograms and utilizes a toll-like receptor ("TLR")7/8 agonist molecule, IMDG adsorbed to alum (Algel) as adjuvants which generates a Th1-biased immune response (cell-mediated immunity) that induces high neutralization efficacy against different variants and robust long-term memory B cell and T cell responses. The adjuvant used in the formulation of COVAXIN was developed in the United States with funding from the National Institutes of Health ("NIH") and is the first adjuvant in an authorized or approved vaccine against an infectious disease to activate TLR7/8. The alum in the adjuvant stimulates the immune system to search for an invading pathogen. Molecules that activate TLR7/8 provide a powerful stimulation of the immune system. COVAXIN is intended for administration into the deltoid muscle of the upper arm, in two doses occurring 28 days apart, and has an expected shelf life of 24 months from the date of manufacture at 2-8°C and a six-month stability at room temperature (25°C).
The rise of COVID-19 genetic variants has raised concerns that these variants may be able to escape neutralization by vaccines. The data from clinical trials conducted in India suggest that COVAXIN elicits a broad-spectrum immune response (including S and nucleocapsid proteins) and induces both humoral and cellular responses. In addition, COVAXIN is designed to generate memory B cell and T cell responses for its multiple epitopes, potentially indicating longevity of response and a rapid antibody response to future infections. Furthermore, data suggests that COVAXIN may potentially generate robust immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and certain of its variants, including the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529), for at least six months after vaccination. We believe COVAXIN has certain characteristics that may be beneficial as compared to other currently authorized or approved messenger RNA ("mRNA"), adenovirus-based vaccines, and protein subunit vaccines. COVAXIN represents an important additional vaccine option for individuals who are looking for a well-established approach to vaccine development and manufacturing.
The inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus in COVAXIN is inactivated using β-propiolactone treatment at a low temperature. As an inactivated virus vaccine, we believe COVAXIN can use all the proteins in the virus to elicit an immune response, rather than targeting the S protein alone, which is a characteristic of the mRNA and adenovirus-based vaccines. We believe an inactivated whole-virion vaccine can produce a more robust response that can elicit memory and cross-react with mutated strains. We believe that, once vaccinated with COVAXIN, the immune system can respond to a live infection of SARS-CoV-2.

Bharat Biotech Clinical Trials
Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials were conducted by Bharat Biotech in India to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of COVAXIN. These clinical trials reported a favorable safety profile and strong Immunoglobulin G ("IgG") responses against the S protein, the receptor-binding domain, and the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 along with strong cellular responses. Strong cellular responses are necessary for memory and long-term durability of vaccines. No SAEs were reported in these clinical trials.
A Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted by Bharat Biotech in India to evaluate the efficacy of COVAXIN. The Phase 3 clinical trial enrolled 25,798 adults, ages 18 years and older, who were healthy or had stable chronic medical conditions, including 10.7% of participants over the age of 60 and 27.5% of participants with at least one coexisting condition, including cardio-vascular, diabetes, or any other chronic stable condition. Participants with no serological evidence of previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 received two doses of either COVAXIN or the placebo administered four weeks apart. The Phase 3 clinical trial reported an overall estimated vaccine efficacy of COVAXIN against COVID-19 of 77.8%, with efficacy against severe COVID-19 of 93.4%, and efficacy against asymptomatic COVID-19 of 63.6%. Individuals with asymptomatic infection have a detectable viral load in nasal and saliva swabs and therefore are considered carriers of COVID-19. Cross variant protection was also demonstrated with a vaccine efficacy of 65.2% against the Delta variant (B.1.617.2). The aforementioned efficacy results represent point estimates of vaccine efficacy with a 95% confidence interval ("CI"), which is above the success criteria of 50%. Adverse events in the COVAXIN and control arms of the Phase 3 clinical trial were observed in 12.4% of subjects, with less than 0.5% of subjects experiencing SAEs. Data from the clinical trials and from research conducted by third parties has shown that COVAXIN has neutralizing potential against multiple variants, including the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant, which is a variant of concern. Further, recent studies have shown that individuals receiving a COVAXIN booster dose six months following the second dose of COVAXIN saw a significant increase in neutralizing titers, an important predictor of vaccine efficacy. The increase in neutralizing titers was higher than that achieved after the primary two-dose series.
A Phase 2/3 immuno-bridging clinical trial was conducted by Bharat Biotech in India to assess the immunity of COVAXIN in children ages two to 18 years. COVAXIN is formulated such that the same dosage can be administered to adults and children alike. The results demonstrated a robust neutralizing antibody response comparable to that of the adults studied in the Phase 2 clinical trial conducted by Bharat Biotech in India, and that COVAXIN was generally well tolerated. Among the 526 study subjects in the Phase 2/3 pediatric clinical trial, no SAEs were reported.
Regulatory Pathway in the Ocugen Covaxin Territory
In January 2023, we announced top-line results from our Phase 2/3 immuno-bridging and broadening clinical trial in the United States evaluating COVAXIN for adults ages 18 years and older. The clinical trial was designed to evaluate whether the immune response observed in participants in Bharat Biotech's completed Phase 3 clinical trial in India is similar to a demographically representative, adult population in the United States. The clinical trial enrolled 419 adult participants that were randomized to receive either two doses of COVAXIN or a placebo, 28 days apart. Immune responses were adjusted for differences between the U.S. and Indian cohorts in baseline neutralizing antibody, body mass index, gender, and age. Both co-primary immunogenicity endpoints were met, with the 95% CI for the propensity score-adjusted geometric mean titer ratio being well above the non-inferiority limit of 0.667. The 95% CI for the propensity score-adjusted difference in seroconversion rates were well above the non-inferiority limit of (10)%. There were no deaths, related potential immune mediated medical conditions, or related adverse events of special interest. Additionally, there were no cases of myocarditis, pericarditis, thrombotic events, or Guillain-Barré syndrome. There were no cases of adverse events and SAEs related to the vaccination. 30 medically attended adverse events in 18 subjects and two SAEs in one subject were reported, all of which were considered unrelated to the vaccination. We plan to work with government agencies in the United States to obtain funding in order to comply with the requirements of a BLA submission, including funding to initiate an adult safety clinical trial subject to discussions with the FDA.
We also have rights to commercialize COVAXIN in Canada and Mexico. In July 2021, we completed our rolling submission to Health Canada for COVAXIN. The rolling submission process, which was conducted through our Canadian subsidiary, Vaccigen, was recommended and accepted under the Minister of Health's Interim Order and transitioned to a NDS for COVID-19. In August 2022, we withdrew our NDS based on discussions with Health Canada and are evaluating the requirements for resubmitting an updated NDS. In Mexico, the COFEPRIS authorized emergency use for COVAXIN for adults ages 18 years and older, which remains active. We are in discussions with CONACYT in Mexico regarding our submission for EUA for COVAXIN for pediatric use in ages five to 18 years.

Overview of the Seasonal Flu
The seasonal flu, or seasonal influenza, is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses circulating globally. In temperate climates, seasonal epidemics occur mainly during the winter, while in other regions, transmission may occur throughout the year, causing outbreaks more irregularly. The seasonal flu causes illnesses that range in severity and may lead to hospitalization and death in certain cases. The seasonal flu is characterized by the sudden onset of the following: fever, dry cough (typically), headache, muscle and joint pain, severe malaise, sore throat, and runny nose. Most people infected with the seasonal flu recover from the fever and other symptoms within a week without requiring medical attention, but the cough can be more severe and last two weeks or more. Although most people recover quickly from the seasonal flu, severe illness and death can occur particularly among high risk groups including children, the elderly, pregnant women, health care workers, and those with serious underlying medical conditions. Worldwide, the seasonal flu is estimated to result in 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and 0.3 million to 0.7 million respiratory deaths.
The seasonal flu spreads easily and rapidly transmits in crowded areas. The seasonal flu is transmitted when an infected person coughs or sneezes and droplets containing the virus are dispersed into the air and infects those in close proximity that breathe the droplets in. The seasonal flu can also spread through physical contact, although this type of transmission is less common than airborne transmission. Those infected with the seasonal flu are most contagious within the first three to four days of infection. Transmission may begin one day before symptoms develop and may continue for five to seven days after symptoms develop. The flu is most commonly prevented by getting an annual flu vaccine and taking preventative actions to avoid transmission such as staying away from those who are sick, frequent handwashing, and covering coughs and sneezes. For the 2022 to 2023 flu season, over 50% of the U.S. population above six months of age has received a seasonal flu shot with over 170 million doses being administered. Several flu antiviral drugs are also available in different dosage forms to treat the seasonal flu, including pills, liquid, an inhaled powder, or an intravenous solution. These flu antiviral drugs are only available through a prescription from a healthcare provider and are not sold over the counter.
Novel Inhaled Mucosal Vaccine Platform for the Prevention of COVID-19 and the Seasonal Flu
We are developing a novel inhaled mucosal vaccine platform, which includes OCU500, a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine; OCU510, a seasonal quadrivalent flu vaccine; and OCU520, a combination quadrivalent seasonal flu and bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. OCU510 is being developed for the global market.
Our novel inhaled mucosal vaccine platform is specifically designed to generate local mucosal immunity in the nasopharyngeal region. The mucosal vaccination method has demonstrated potent induction of both mucosal and systemic immune responses, which prevents infection and spread, thereby limiting the origins of new variants. We believe our novel inhaled mucosal vaccine platform is unique as it is designed to induce mucosal immunity, which is crucial for preventing upper respiratory tract infection, as compared to intramuscular vaccines. The advantages of these inhaled mucosal vaccines include needle-free administration, the potential for increased compliance, scalable manufacturing, storage and shipping at standard refrigerated conditions, and the potential to develop multi-strain and variant-specific versions. As these vaccine candidates are being developed to be administered through inhalation, we believe our novel inhaled mucosal vaccine platform has the potential to generate rapid local immunity in the upper airways and lungs where viruses enter and infect the body, which we believe may help reduce or prevent infection and transmission as well as provide protection against new virus variants.
The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the principal target for antibody-based and vaccine countermeasures. The S protein serves as the primary viral attachment and entry factor to promote SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells. In preclinical studies that have been conducted to assess the durability, dose response, and cross-protective activity in mice, it was demonstrated that a single dose of our inhaled mucosal COVID-19 vaccine induced durably high neutralizing and antibody effector responses in serum and S protein specific IgG and Immunoglobulin A, which is essential for reducing infection and transmission of COVID-19. This approach represents a potential universal booster, regardless of previous COVID-19 vaccination. OCU520, our combination quadrivalent seasonal flu and bivalent COVID-19 vaccine, is designed to provide the unique ease of getting both an annual COVID-19 booster vaccine and an annual seasonal flu vaccine in one vaccine.
Pursuant to the WU License Agreement, we obtained the rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize an inhaled mucosal COVID-19 vaccine in the Mucosal Vaccine Territory. We are developing the seasonal flu component of this inhaled mucosal vaccine platform internally. We intend to initiate IND-enabling studies and work closely with government agencies to obtain funding for the development of these inhaled mucosal vaccines.

NOVEL BIOLOGIC PRODUCT CANDIDATE FOR RETINAL DISEASES
We are developing OCU200, which is a novel fusion protein containing parts of human tumstatin and transferrin. OCU200 is designed to treat DME, DR, and wet AMD. We have completed the technology transfer of manufacturing processes to our CDMO and have produced clinical trial materials to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial. We submitted an IND application to the FDA in February 2023 to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial targeting DME. The planned Phase 1 clinical study will assess the unilateral intravitreal administration of OCU200 alone or in combination with an approved anti-VEGF therapy in participants with DME. This is a multicenter, open-label, dose ranging study with three cohorts in the dose-escalation portion of the study and one cohort in the combination therapy portion of the study.
Overview of DR and DME
DR is a sight-threatening complication of diabetes arising from the over-accumulation of glucose, which can block blood vessels in the retina and cut off blood supply, leading to the damage of blood vessels in the retina. DR is classified into two subtypes: non-proliferative DR and proliferative DR. Non-proliferative DR is the early stage of DR wherein blood vessels are unable to grow, blood vessel walls weaken, and nerve fibers in the retina may swell. Proliferative DR is the advanced stage of DR in which damaged blood vessels close off, leading to the growth of new, abnormal blood vessels in the retina. This growth of new, abnormal blood vessels in the retina can lead to scar tissue, which can result in the detachment of the retina from the back of the eye.
Complications from DR could lead to DME. In DME, bulges can protrude from the blood vessel walls, leading to the leakage of fluid and blood into the retina. This leakage results in swelling, or "edema," in the macula, which is a part of the retina. DME may occur at any stage of DR but is more likely to occur as the disease progresses. DME is the most common reason for vision loss in patients with DR.
DR and DME are the most common vision-threatening diseases in patients with diabetes. Approximately 162 million individuals are affected with DR and approximately 21 million with DME worldwide. As the population of people experiencing diabetes increases, these statistics are expected to increase, due to poor disease management and lifestyle-related changes. There are limited treatment options available for patients with DR and DME. Current first-line treatments for DR and DME include the use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ("VEGF") therapy and anti-inflammatory therapy, such as corticosteroids. These treatments do not work effectively in approximately 50% of patients with DME. There is a significant need to develop a novel, differentiated therapeutic to treat DR and DME.
Additionally, current therapies target only one pathway associated with DR and DME, either angiogenesis (development of new blood vessels) with anti-VEGF therapy, such as Ranibizumab or Aflibercept, or inflammation in case of corticosteroid therapy, such as Dexamethasone or Fluocinolone. The development of a therapeutic which targets multiple causative pathways of DR and DME, such as angiogenesis, oxidation, and inflammation, would offer a potential treatment option for all patients. We believe that OCU200 possesses unique characteristics to target these pathways and has the potential to offer better treatment options for all patients with DR and DME.
Overview of Wet AMD
OCU200 also has the potential to represent a better treatment option for patients suffering from wet AMD. Most AMD cases begin as dry AMD and may progress towards the advanced "wet" form. Wet AMD is caused by abnormal blood vessels in the retina that leak fluid or blood into the macula. The result can be irreversible damage to photoreceptor cells and rapid, severe vision loss, particularly in the center of the field of vision, causing significant functional impairment. If left untreated, neovascularization in wet AMD patients typically results in significant vision loss and the formation of a scar under the macula. Wet AMD affects approximately 10-15% of patients with AMD but progresses more rapidly and is known to be responsible for approximately 90% of all AMD-related blindness.
AMD is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. The incidence of wet AMD increases substantially with age, and it is expected that the number of cases of wet AMD will increase with the growth of the elderly population. It has been estimated that approximately 296 million individuals worldwide have some form of AMD of which, approximately 30 million, or 10%, suffer from wet AMD.
Current FDA approved therapeutics for wet AMD include intravitreal injection of either Ranibizumab or Aflibercept, which are anti-VEGF therapies. Though treatments have been effective in mitigating the disease symptoms, clinical studies suggest substantial limitations remain. For example, a significant percentage of people do not respond to therapy and experience continuous deterioration of their vision. Additionally, the repeated use of anti-VEGF therapy becomes less effective over time. 
Table of Contents

Between 30-50% of people affected by wet AMD continue to have fluid remain in the middle of the eye, also called the subretinal space, even after one to two years of treatment.
Given the above limitations of these existing treatments, we believe that a substantial unmet medical need exists for the treatment of DR, DME, and wet AMD.
OCU200 for the Treatment of DR, DME, and Wet AMD
OCU200 is a novel fusion protein containing parts of human tumstatin and transferrin, that are already present normally in retinal tissues. Patients affected by these diseases share common symptoms, such as blurriness in vision and continued vision loss through disease progression. The formation of fragile and leaky new abnormal blood vessels leads to fluid accumulation in and around the retina, causing vision damage.
We believe OCU200 possesses unique features and is designed to enable it to efficiently target leaky blood vessels, regress the existing abnormal blood vessels, and inhibit the growth of new blood vessels in the retina and choroid. Tumstatin, which acts as an anti-VEGF, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative agent, is the active component of OCU200. It binds to integrin receptors, which play a crucial role in disease pathogenesis. Transferrin is an iron carrier that delivers iron intracellularly. It enhances the delivery of fused proteins across cellular barriers, including retinal barriers. It allows the targeting of anti-angiogenic peptide to the multiplying endothelial cells. OCU200 is designed to address the limitations of current therapies by targeting multiple mechanisms associated with ocular neovascularization and inflammation specifically focusing on non-responders to currently available treatment options.
A proof-of-concept study involving different animal models demonstrated the therapeutic potential of OCU200 in the treatment of DR, DME, and wet AMD. In an animal model for DME and DR (oxygen-induced retinopathy in mice), OCU200, at a significantly lower dose (10 micrograms per eye), was comparable to existing approved anti-VEGF therapy (Eylea, 20 micrograms per eye) in preventing disease manifestation and progression. In animal models for wet AMD (laser induced choroidal neovascularization in mice and rats), OCU200 demonstrated comparable or slightly better activity compared to anti-VEGF control groups in preventing the formation and growth of new leaky blood vessels and subsequent disease symptoms. We believe OCU200's distinct mechanism of action through the target of the integrin pathway will potentially provide benefit to patients, particularly to those patients that do not respond to currently approved therapies.
COMPETITION
The biotechnology industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies as well as a strong emphasis on intellectual property leading to a highly competitive environment for the development and commercialization of therapeutic products, regenerative medicines, and vaccines. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. We face competition from many different sources, including from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization. We plan to compete in the segments of pharmaceutical, biotechnological, and other related markets with therapeutics, regenerative medicines, and vaccines that have an acceptable safety profile and target commercially attractive indications.
The development and commercialization of gene therapies is highly competitive. We are aware of several companies focusing on gene therapies for various ophthalmic indications including Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, as acquired by Syncona Limited, Astellas Pharma Inc., MeiraGTx Holdings plc in partnership with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Nanoscope Therapeutics Inc., REGENXBIO Inc., Novartis AG, F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG ("Roche AG"), Kiora Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Genentech, Inc. in partnership with Lineage Cell Therapeutics, Inc., and Luxturna, the product developed by Spark Therapeutics, Inc. and marketed by Roche AG, is currently the only gene therapy approved to treat IRDs in the United States which addresses only mutations in the RPE65 gene. The mutation associated with the RPE65 gene represents just one of more than 125 mutated genes linked to RP and LCA.
The regenerative medicine sector is characterized by innovative science, rapidly advancing technologies, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. The competitive landscape in the field of articular cartilage repair in the U.S. is emerging and has stimulated a substantial amount of interest from companies developing tissue repair solutions. Companies that may compete with our NeoCart product candidate include Vericel Corporation's MACI, the only FDA-approved ACI product in the United States, and Aesculap Biologics, LLC's NOVOCART 3D, which is currently enrolling subjects in their Phase 3 clinical trial.
Table of Contents

We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from companies as well as institutions that are pursuing or have commercialized vaccines that would compete with our vaccine candidates, COVAXIN and our novel inhaled mucosal vaccine platform, if commercialized. The competitive landscape of COVID-19 vaccines has been rapidly developing since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and includes competitors such as Pfizer Inc./BioNTech SE, Moderna, Inc., AstraZeneca PLC, Novavax, Inc., Sinovac Biotech Ltd., Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, and Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology. Each of the aforementioned vaccines have been authorized or approved in at least one country within the Ocugen COVAXIN Territory or the Mucosal Vaccine Territory and are intramuscular vaccines. CanSinoBIO's Convidecia Air, an intranasal vaccine targeting COVID-19, has been approved in China. Other competitors for our novel inhaled mucosal vaccine platform include CyanVac LLC, Meissa Vaccines, Inc., Codagenix, Inc., Intravacc B.V., McMaster University, and Tetherex Pharmaceuticals Corporation. Companies such as Pfizer Inc./BioNTech SE, Moderna, Inc., CureVac N.V in partnership with GSK plc, Vivaldi Biosciences Inc., and Novavax, Inc. are also in the process of developing a combination vaccine that will protect against COVID-19 and the seasonal flu. Vivaldi Biosciences Inc. is also currently undergoing clinical trials for their intranasal vaccine for the seasonal flu.
The development and commercialization of biologic products is highly competitive as well. Companies that may compete with our OCU200 product candidate include Roche AG, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., AsclepiX Therapeutics, Inc., Outlook Therapeutics, Inc., Novartis AG, Oxurion NV, Unity Biotechnology, Inc., Opthea Limited, and 4D Molecular Therapeutics, Inc. Roche AG, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Novartis AG have marketed anti-VEGF products.
Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, may have significantly greater financial resources to support research and development, manufacturing, preclinical studies, and clinical trials, as well as regulatory, commercialization, and marketing efforts. These organizations also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites, patient registration for clinical trials, licensing or acquiring technologies necessary for our programs, and in our commercialization efforts if our product candidates are approved. Early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRODUCT APPROVAL
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state, and local level, and in other countries including Canada, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, approval, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, monitoring and reporting, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, sales, import, and export of biotechnological and drug products such as those we are developing. In addition, labelers of biotechnology and drug products (the entity owning the National Drug Code listed for a product) participating in Medicaid and Medicare are required to comply with mandatory price reporting, discounts, rebates, and other requirements. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in other countries including Canada, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics and drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") and its implementing regulations. In addition to the FDCA and its implementing regulations, biological products are regulated under the Public Health Service Act ("PHSA") and its implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice ("GLP") regulations, applicable requirements for the human use of laboratory animals, such as the Animal Welfare Act ("AWA"), or other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin at U.S. clinical trial sites;

Preclinical Studies and IND Submission
The testing and approval process of product candidates requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity, and product formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Such studies must generally be conducted in accordance with GLP, the AWA, and other applicable regulations and requirements. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial at a U.S. investigational site with a product candidate, an IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests and preclinical literature, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, and proposed clinical study protocols, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND submission. Some preclinical studies may continue even after the IND is in effect.
An IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, notifies the applicant of safety concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial may begin. Even after the IND application has gone into effect and clinical testing has begun, the FDA may impose clinical holds on clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance with the requirements of applicable regulations. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. As a result, submission of an IND application may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial, and we cannot be sure that once the clinical trials have begun, issues will not arise that will suspend or terminate such studies. A separate submission to an existing IND application must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects (healthy volunteers or patients) under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with federal regulations and GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial, as well as the review and approval of the study by an IRB. Investigators must also provide certain information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, and a statistical analysis plan. A protocol for each clinical trial, and any subsequent protocol amendments, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND submission. If a product candidate is being investigated for multiple intended indications, separate IND applications may also be required. In addition, an IRB at each study site participating in the clinical trial and/or a central IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial, informed consent forms, and communications to study subjects before a study commences at that site. An IRB 
Table of Contents

is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants, and considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, and whether the planned human subject protections are adequate. The IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must also be submitted at least annually to the FDA and the IRB and more frequently if SAEs or other significant safety information is found.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in-vitro testing and other sources that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. If the FDA issues a clinical hold halting a clinical trial, the agency must notify the IND sponsor of the grounds for the hold. Any identified deficiencies must be resolved before the FDA will lift the hold and allow the clinical trial to begin or resume. There is no guarantee the FDA will ever lift a clinical hold once put in place. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements or if the trial poses an unexpected serious harm to subjects. The FDA or an IRB may also impose conditions on the conduct of a clinical trial. Clinical trial sponsors may also choose to discontinue clinical trials as a result of risks to subjects, a lack of favorable results, or changing business priorities.
Information about certain clinical trials, including a description of the study and study results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its clinicaltrials.gov website. Sponsors or distributors of investigational products for the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of one or more serious diseases or conditions must also have a publicly available policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access requests. This requirement applies on the earlier of the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug or, as applicable, 15 days after the drug receives a designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or RMAT. Expanded access refers to the use of an investigational drug or biologic when the primary purpose is to diagnose, monitor, or treat a patient’s disease or condition rather than to obtain the kind of information that is generally derived from clinical trials. Expanded access may be appropriate when a patient has a serious or life-threatening disease, there is no comparable approved therapy available, the patient cannot be enrolled in a clinical trial, the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks, and providing expanded access will not interfere with the product candidate’s development or approval. The posting of an expanded access policy does not guarantee access to the investigational drug or biologic. When a sponsor provides expanded access, it does so voluntarily. The FDA cannot compel a sponsor to provide such access.
The manufacture of investigational drugs and biologics for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to current GMP requirements. Investigational drugs, biologics, active ingredients, and therapeutic substances imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA. Further, the export of investigational products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country, as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA.
In general, for purposes of NDA and BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.
•Phase 1 — Studies are initially conducted in a small group of healthy human volunteers or subjects (e.g., 10 to 20 subjects) with the target disease or condition to test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, structure-activity relationships, mechanism of action, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion. If possible, Phase 1 trials may also be used to gain an initial indication of product effectiveness.
•Phase 2 — Controlled studies are conducted in larger but still limited subject populations (e.g., a few hundred patients) with a specified disease or condition to evaluate preliminary efficacy, identify optimal dosages, dosage tolerance and schedule, possible adverse effects and safety risks, and expanded evidence of safety.
•Phase 3 — These adequate and well-controlled clinical trials are undertaken in expanded subject populations (e.g., several hundred to several thousand patients), generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to generate enough data to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and safety of the product candidate for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product candidate, and to provide adequate information for 
Table of Contents

the labeling of the product candidate. Typically, two Phase 3 trials are required by the FDA for product approval. Under some limited circumstances, however, the FDA may approve an NDA or BLA based upon a single Phase 3 clinical study.
The FDA may also require, or companies may conduct, additional clinical trials for the same indication after a product is approved. These are referred to as Phase 4 studies and may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm or refute the effectiveness of a product candidate, and can provide important long-term safety information.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with current GMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, manufacturers must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
There are also various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals.
Marketing Application Submission, Review by the FDA, and Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical and preclinical testing, the results of product development, including CMC, non-clinical studies, and clinical trial results, including negative or ambiguous results, as well as positive findings, are all submitted to the FDA, along with the proposed labeling, as part of an NDA, in the case of a drug, or BLA, in the case of a biologic, requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of a marketing application is subject to a substantial application user fee. These user fees must be paid at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the application is being submitted on a rolling basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances. One basis for a waiver of the application user fee is if the applicant employs fewer than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates, the applicant does not have an approved marketing application for a product that has been introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, and the applicant, including its affiliates, is submitting its first marketing application. Product candidates that are designated as orphan products, which are further described below, are also not subject to application user fees unless the application includes an indication other than the orphan indication. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA or NDA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act ("PREA"), a BLA or NDA or supplement to a BLA or NDA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen, or route of administration, must contain data that is adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after the approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Orphan products are also exempt from the PREA requirements.
The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy ("REMS") to ensure that the benefits of the product candidate outweigh the risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. An assessment of the REMS must also be conducted at set intervals. Following product approval, a REMS may also be required by the FDA if new safety information is discovered and the FDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the product continue to outweigh the risks. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription, or dispensing of products.
Once the FDA receives an application, it generally takes 60 days to review the NDA or BLA to determine if it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review, before it accepts the application for filing. The FDA may refuse to review any application that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is 
Table of Contents

also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA"), the FDA has set the review goal of completing its review of 90% of all applications for new molecular entities within 10 months of the 60-day filing date. The FDA also has the review goal of completing its review of 90% of non-new molecular entity marketing applications within 10 months of the agency's receipt of the application. These review goals are referred to as the PDUFA date. The PDUFA date is only a goal, thus, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates. The review process and the PDUFA date may also be extended if the FDA requests or the sponsor otherwise provides substantial additional information or clarification regarding the submission.
The FDA may also refer certain applications to an advisory committee. Before approving a product candidate for which no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of an active ingredient) has previously been approved by the FDA, the FDA must either refer that product candidate to an external advisory committee or provide in an action letter a summary of the reasons why the FDA did not refer the product candidate to an advisory committee. The FDA may also refer other product candidates to an advisory committee if the FDA believes that the advisory committee's expertise would be beneficial. An advisory committee is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, which review, evaluate, and make a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product candidate meets the agency's approval standards and whether the manufacturing methods and controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity. Before approving a marketing application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured, referred to as a Pre-Approval Inspection. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities, including contract manufacturers and subcontractors, are in compliance with current GMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a marketing application, the FDA will inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs. To assure current GMP and GCP compliance, an applicant will incur significant expenditure of time, money, and effort in the areas of training, recordkeeping, production, and quality control.
After evaluating the marketing application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter ("CRL"). A CRL indicates that the review cycle for the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. It also describes all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified. A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the marketing application, and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes; or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either: resubmit the marketing application addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter; withdraw the application; or request an opportunity for a hearing. The FDA has the goal of reviewing 90% of application resubmissions following a CRL in either two or six months of the resubmission date, depending on the kind of resubmission. Even with the submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA's satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications or populations for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product's safety and efficacy after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may also not approve label statements that are necessary for successful commercialization and marketing.
After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. The FDA may also withdraw the product approval if compliance with the pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards are not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling changes, or FDA notification may be required.

For example, as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the product's safety or efficacy. In addition, holders of an approved NDA or BLA are required to submit annual reports and keep extensive records to report certain adverse reactions and issues related to production to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products. Additionally, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to current GMP regulations and practices, as well as the manufacturing conditions of approval set forth in the NDA or BLA. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with current GMP, which imposes certain procedural, substantive, and recordkeeping requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with current GMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. If, after receiving approval, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process (all of which are, to some degree, incorporated in the NDA or BLA), additional regulatory review and approval may be required.
Future FDA inspections may identify current GMP compliance issues at manufacturing facilities or at the facilities of third-party suppliers that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct and prevent recurrence of any deficiencies, and could result in fines or penalties by regulatory authorities. In addition, discovery of problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action, including warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, license revocations, seizure, total or partial suspension of production or criminal penalties, any of which could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or efficacy data may require changes to a product's approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications.
Emergency Use Authorization
The FDA has the authority to grant an EUA to allow unapproved medical products, including vaccines, to be used in a public health emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. When issuing an EUA, the FDA imposes conditions of authorization, with which the sponsor must comply. Such conditions include, but may not be limited to, compliance with labeling, distribution of materials designed to ensure proper use, reporting obligations, and restrictions on advertising and promotion. The EUA is only effective for the duration of the public health emergency. Although the criteria of an EUA differs from the criteria for approval of an NDA or BLA, EUAs nevertheless require the development and submission of data to satisfy the relevant FDA standards and a number of ongoing compliance obligations. In addition, the FDA expects EUA holders to work toward submission of an NDA or BLA, as soon as possible. The FDA may revoke or terminate the EUA sooner if, for example, the holder of the EUA fails to comply with the terms of the EUA or the product is determined to be less efficacious or safe than it was initially believed to be. The FDA may revoke an EUA if there is a failure to comply with the conditions of authorization. There is no guarantee that a product candidate will meet the criteria for EUA.
Pediatric Exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity periods for both drugs and biologics, and also Orange Book listed patents in the case of drugs. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA's determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform and report on the requested studies within the statutory timeframe.
Orphan Products
The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of products for rare diseases or conditions. Specifically, sponsors may apply for and receive ODD if a product candidate is intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 0.2 million individuals in the United States, or affecting more than 0.2 million individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States will be recovered from U.S. sales. ODD must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain ODD if there is a product already approved by the FDA that is considered by the FDA to be the same and is intended for the same indication. This hypothesis must be demonstrated to obtain ODD exclusivity. If granted, prior to product approval, ODD entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and certain user-fee waivers. The tax advantages, however, were limited in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. After the FDA grants ODD, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. ODD does not convey any advantage in, or 
Table of Contents

shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA or BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with ODD generally is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with ODD exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care. ODD exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.
Patent Term Restoration
If approved, drug and biologic products may also be eligible for periods of U.S. patent term restoration. If granted, patent term restoration extends the patent life of a single unexpired patent, that has not previously been extended, for a maximum of five years. The total patent life of the product with the extension also cannot exceed 14 years from the product's approval date. Subject to prior limitations, the period of extension is calculated by adding half of the time from the effective date of an IND application to the initial submission of a marketing application, and all of the time between the submission of the marketing application and its approval. This period may also be reduced by any time that the applicant did not act with due diligence. Only one patent claiming each approved product is eligible for restoration and the patent holder must apply for restoration within 60 days of approval. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"), in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for patent term restoration.
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of certain product candidates that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs or present a significant improvement over existing therapy. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new therapeutics to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. These expedited programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and RMAT designation. Each of these programs has its own features and qualifying criteria. A sponsor must submit a request for fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, or priority review, which may or may not be granted by the FDA. 
To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product candidate is intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. If fast track designation is obtained, sponsors may be eligible for more frequent development meetings and correspondence with the FDA. In addition, the FDA may initiate review of sections of an application before the application is complete. This "rolling review" is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the remaining information. Whether the FDA is able to commence its review of portions of an application before receipt of the complete submission depends on a number of factors. In some cases, a fast track product may be eligible for accelerated approval or priority review.
The FDA may give a priority review designation to product candidates that are intended to treat serious conditions and, if approved, would provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of the serious condition. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA is to review an application within six months, rather than the standard review of 10 months under current PDUFA guidelines.
Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means the FDA may approve the product based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. A drug or biologic candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect of the product. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug or biologic from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug or biologic candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
Under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a "breakthrough therapy." A breakthrough therapy is defined as a product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and 
Table of Contents

preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Products designated as breakthrough therapies are eligible for intensive guidance on an efficient development program beginning as early as Phase 1 trials, a commitment from the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced review staff in a proactive collaborative and cross-disciplinary review, rolling review, and the facilitation of cross-disciplinary review.
Established under the 21st Century Cures Act, RMAT designation is a dedicated program designed to expedite the drug development and review processes for promising pipeline products, including genetic therapies. A regenerative medicine advanced therapy is eligible for RMAT designation if it is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or therapy has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Similar to breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation provides the benefits of intensive FDA guidance on efficient drug development, including the ability for early interactions with FDA to discuss surrogate or intermediate endpoints, potential ways to support accelerated approval and satisfy post-approval requirements, potential priority review of a BLA, and other opportunities to expedite development and review.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Post-approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to extensive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements related to manufacturing, recordkeeping, and reporting, including adverse experience reporting, deviation reporting, shortage reporting, and periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising, marketing, promotion, certain electronic records and signatures, and post-approval obligations imposed as a condition of approval, such as Phase 4 clinical trials, REMS, and surveillance to assess safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to FDA review and approval. There also are continuing annual program user fee requirements for approved products, excluding orphan products. In addition, manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved therapeutics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, list their products, and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with current GMP and other requirements. Manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with current GMP. Regulatory authorities may undertake regulatory enforcement action, withdraw product approvals, require label modifications, or request product recalls, among other actions, if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require FDA approval or notification before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from current GMP and specifications, and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain current GMP compliance.
The FDA also strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Physicians, in their independent professional medical judgment, may prescribe legally available products for unapproved indications that are not described in the product's labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Biotechnological companies, however, are required to promote their products only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including, but not limited to, criminal and civil penalties under the FDCA and False Claims Act ("FCA"), exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, mandatory compliance programs under corporate integrity agreements, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts. In addition, newly discovered or developed safety or efficacy data may require changes to a product's approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications.
In addition, the distribution of prescription biotechnological samples is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act ("PDMA"), which regulates the distribution of samples at the federal level. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription biotechnological product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. Free trial or 
Table of Contents

starter prescriptions provided through pharmacies are also subject to regulations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program ("MDRP") and potential liability under anti-kickback and false claims laws.
Moreover, the Drug Quality and Security Act imposes obligations on sponsors of biotechnological products related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this legislation, sponsors are required to provide certain information regarding the products to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, are required to label products with a product identifier, and are required to keep certain records regarding the product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by sponsors is also required to be done electronically. Sponsors must also verify that purchasers of the sponsors' products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this legislation, manufactures have product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products that would result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. Similar requirements additionally are and will be imposed through this legislation on other companies within the biotechnological product supply chain, such as distributors and dispensers, as well as certain sponsor licensees and affiliates.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in significant regulatory actions. Such actions may include refusal to approve pending applications, license or approval suspension or revocation, imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials, warning letters, untitled letters, Form 483s, cyber letters, modification of promotional materials or labeling, provision of corrective information, imposition of post-market requirements including the need for additional testing, imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS, product recalls, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow imports or exports, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, FDA debarment, injunctions, fines, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, suspension and debarment from government contracts, refusal of orders under existing government contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement, civil or criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment, and adverse publicity, among other adverse consequences.
Additional controls for biologics
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.
After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of the product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing the results of all of the manufacturer's tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.
Gene therapy products are also subject to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, which require, among other things, that trials involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules be reviewed by an Institutional Biosafety Committee ("IBC"). The IBC reviews, approves, and supervises research involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules.
In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving the use of gene therapy. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that the FDA will consider during product development that relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the CMC information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, the FDA recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a prolonged period of time.

Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security, and Transparency Laws and Regulations
Our business activities, including but not limited to, research, marketing, sales, promotion, distribution, medical education, and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous federal and state regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services and its various divisions, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") and the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, and state and local governments. Our business activities must comply with numerous healthcare laws, including but not limited to, anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations, which are described below, as well as state and federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Moreover, to the extent that we license the right to sell our product candidates, if approved, to another entity under that entity's labeler code, the licensee would have regulatory responsibilities, including healthcare, reimbursement, pricing, and reporting regulatory responsibilities.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which regulates, among other things, marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order, or the referral to another for the furnishing or arranging of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs, in whole or in part. The term "remuneration" has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between biotechnological industry members on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. There are certain statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute's intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of a federal healthcare covered business, including purchases of products paid by federal healthcare programs, the statute has been violated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended (the "ACA"), modified the intent requirement under the Anti-Kickback Statute to a stricter standard, such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA also provided that a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is grounds for the government or a whistleblower to assert that a claim for payment of items or services resulting from such violation constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil FCA.
The federal civil FCA prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim includes "any request or demand" for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The civil FCA has been used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price ("AMP"), improper use of Medicare provider or supplier numbers when detailing a provider of services, improper promotion of off-label uses not expressly approved by the FDA in a product's label, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to products, contract requirements, and services rendered. In addition, private payors have been filing follow-on lawsuits alleging fraudulent misrepresentation, although establishing liability and damages in these cases is more difficult than under the FCA. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil FCA. Civil FCA actions may be brought by the government or may be brought by private individuals on behalf of the government, called "qui tam" actions. If the government decides to intervene in a qui tam action and prevails in the lawsuit, the individual will share in the proceeds from any fines or settlement funds. If the government declines to intervene, the individual may pursue the case alone. The civil FCA provides for treble damages and a civil penalty for each false claim, such as an invoice or pharmacy claim for reimbursement, which can aggregate into millions of dollars. For these reasons, since 2004, FCA lawsuits against biotechnological companies have increased significantly in volume and breadth, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements, as much as $3.0 billion, regarding certain sales practices and promoting off label uses. Civil FCA liability may further be imposed for known Medicare or Medicaid overpayments, for example, overpayments caused by understated rebate amounts, that are not refunded within 60 days of discovering the overpayment, even if the overpayment was not caused by a false or fraudulent act. In addition, conviction or civil judgment for violating the FCA may result in exclusion from federal health care programs, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts.

The government may further prosecute conduct constituting a false claim under the criminal FCA. The criminal FCA prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent and, unlike the civil FCA, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim.
The civil monetary penalties statute is another potential statute under which biotechnological companies may be subject to enforcement. Among other things, the civil monetary penalties statue imposes fines against any person who is determined to have knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
Payment or reimbursement of prescription therapeutics by Medicaid or Medicare requires the product's labeler to submit certified pricing information to CMS. The Medicaid Drug Rebate statute requires labelers, as a condition of payment by Medicaid, to calculate and report price points, which are used to determine Medicaid rebate payments shared between the states and the federal government and Medicaid payment rates for certain therapeutics, to pay quarterly rebates on prescriptions paid by Medicaid, and to provide a discount based on the Medicaid rebate percentage to certain hospitals and clinics under the 340B program. For most therapeutics paid under Medicare Part B, labelers must also calculate and report their Average Sales Price, which is used to determine the Medicare Part B payment rate. In addition, therapeutics covered by Medicaid are subject to an additional inflation penalty which can substantially increase rebate payments. For products approved under a BLA (including biosimilars) or an NDA, the Veterans Health Care Act ("VHCA") requires labelers, as a condition of payment by Medicaid, to calculate and report to the Veterans Administration ("VA") a different price called the Non-Federal AMP, which is used to determine the maximum price that can be charged to certain federal agencies, referred to as the Federal Ceiling Price ("FCP"). Like the Medicaid rebate amount, the FCP includes an inflation penalty. A Department of Defense statute and regulation requires labelers to provide this discount on therapeutics dispensed by retail pharmacies when paid by the TRICARE Program, the health care program for military personnel, retirees, and related beneficiaries. All of these price reporting requirements create risk of submitting false information to the government, and potential FCA liability.
The VHCA also requires labelers of covered therapeutics participating in the Medicaid program to enter into Federal Supply Schedule contracts with the VA through which their covered therapeutics must be sold to certain federal agencies at FCP. This necessitates compliance with applicable federal procurement laws and regulations, including submission of commercial sales and pricing information, and subjects us to contractual remedies as well as administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions. In addition, the VHCA requires labelers participating in Medicaid to agree to provide different mandatory discounts to certain Public Health Service grantees and other safety net hospitals and clinics under the 340B program based on the labelers' reported Medicaid pricing information. The 340B program has its own regulatory authority to impose sanctions for non-compliance and adjudicate overcharge claims against labelers by the purchasing entities.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a healthcare benefit program, regardless of whether the payor is public or private, in connection with the delivery or payment for health care benefits, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services relating to healthcare matters. Additionally, the ACA amended the intent requirement of certain of these criminal statutes under HIPAA so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute, or the specific intent to violate it, to have committed a violation.
The ACA further created new federal requirements for reporting, by applicable drug manufacturers of covered therapeutics, payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members, including the Physician Payments Sunshine Act.
Further, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH") and its respective implementing regulations imposes certain requirements on covered entities relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of certain individually identifiable health information, known as protected health information. Among other things, HITECH, through its implementing regulations, makes HIPAA's security standards and certain privacy standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as a person or organization, other than a member of a covered entity's workforce, that creates, receives, maintains, or transmits protected health information on behalf of a covered entity for a function or activity regulated by HIPAA. HITECH also strengthened the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates, and individuals, and gave state attorney generals new authority to file 
Table of Contents

civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, other federal and state laws may govern the privacy and security of health and other information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not be preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Many states have also adopted laws similar to each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. Certain state laws also regulate sponsors' use of prescriber-identifiable data. Certain states also require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments or the provision of other items of value that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; impose restrictions on marketing practices; or require drug companies to track and report information related to payments, gifts, and other items of value to physicians and other healthcare providers.
Recently, states have enacted or are considering legislation intended to make drug prices more transparent and deter significant price increases, typically as consumer protection laws. These laws may affect our future sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws or regulations described above or any other applicable laws, we may be subject to penalties or other enforcement actions, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, corporate integrity agreements, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Enforcement actions can be brought by federal or state governments, or as "qui tam" actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government under the civil FCA if the violations are alleged to have caused the government to pay a false or fraudulent claim.
To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
Coverage and Reimbursement
The commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our product candidates. Government authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations generally decide which therapeutics they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for healthcare. Medicare is a federally funded program managed by CMS through local fiscal intermediaries and carriers that administer coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare items and services furnished to the elderly and disabled. Medicaid is an insurance program for certain categories of patients whose income and assets fall below state defined levels and who are otherwise uninsured that is both federally and state funded and managed by each state. The federal government sets general guidelines for Medicaid and each state creates specific regulations that govern its individual program, including supplemental rebate programs that restrict coverage to therapeutics on the state Preferred Drug List. Similarly, government laws and regulations establish the parameters for coverage of prescription therapeutics by health plans participating in state exchanges and TRICARE. Some states have also created pharmacy assistance programs for individuals who do not qualify for federal programs. In the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government provides reimbursement through the Medicare or Medicaid programs for such products and services.
In the United States, the EU, and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be and sometimes at or below the provider's acquisition cost. In the United States, it is also common for government and private health plans to use coverage determinations to leverage rebates from labelers in order to reduce the plans' net costs. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and lower the realization on labelers' sales of prescription therapeutics. Third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific therapeutic products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA approved products for a particular indication or might impose high copayment amounts to influence patient choice. Third-party payors also control costs by requiring prior authorization or imposing other dispensing 
Table of Contents

restrictions before covering certain products and by broadening therapeutic classes to increase competition. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Absent clinical differentiators, third-party payors may treat products as therapeutically equivalent and base formulary decisions on net cost. To lower the prescription cost, labelers frequently rebate a portion of the prescription price to the third-party payors. Recently, purchasers and third-party payors have begun to focus on value of new therapeutics and sought agreements in which price is based on achievement of performance metrics.
Federal programs also impose price controls through mandatory ceiling prices on purchases by federal agencies and federally funded hospitals and clinics and mandatory rebates on retail pharmacy prescriptions paid by Medicaid and TRICARE. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government programs may result in lower reimbursement for our product candidates or exclusion of our product candidates from coverage. In addition, government programs like Medicaid include substantial penalties for increasing commercial prices over the rate of inflation which can affect realization and return on investment.
Private payors often rely on the lead of the governmental payors in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Therefore, achieving favorable CMS coverage and reimbursement is usually a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product. In addition, many government programs as a condition of participation mandate fixed discounts or rebates from labelers regardless of formulary position or utilization, and then rely on competition in the market to attain further price reductions, which can greatly reduce realization on the sale.
Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the EU will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement, and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, competition within therapeutic classes, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid, and healthcare reform, biotechnological coverage and reimbursement policies, and pricing in general. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Sales of our product candidates will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and internationally, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates, if approved, will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit, and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, and other third-party payors.
As a result of the above, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates, if approved, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective, or the rebate percentages required to secure coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost. Additionally, companies are increasingly finding it necessary to establish bridge programs to assist patients with access to new therapies during protracted initial coverage determination periods.
Moreover, a payor's decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved or that significant price concessions will not be required to avoid restrictive conditions. High health plan copayment requirements may result in patients refusing prescriptions or seeking alternative therapies. Additionally, where a new indication has been approved for a drug or biologic previously approved under a different NDA or BLA, health plans may cover off-label use of the original drug, even if it cannot be marketed for the new indication. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in therapeutic development. Legislative action to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our products and product candidates or exclusion of our products and product candidates from coverage. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part.
Healthcare Reform Measures
The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription products.
Table of Contents

In recent years, Congress has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for products administered by physicians. CMS, the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, also has authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some products. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products. While Medicare regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers.
The ACA, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, the ACA expanded manufacturers' rebate liability under the MDRP by increasing the minimum Medicaid rebate for both branded and generic products, expanded the 340B program, and revised the definition of AMP, which could increase the amount of Medicaid rebates manufacturers are required to pay to states. The legislation also extended Medicaid rebates, previously due only on fee-for-service Medicaid utilization, to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well and created an alternative rebate formula for certain new formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the amount of rebates due on those products. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the MDRP under the ACA. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016. Since that time, there have been significant ongoing efforts to modify or eliminate the ACA. The Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, commonly referred to as the individual mandate.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the passage of the ACA. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation's automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. Subsequent legislation extended the 2.0% reduction, on average, to 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act"), the 2.0% Medicare sequester reductions were suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of July 2, 2022, the 2.0% sequester reduction resumed. This sequestration will remain in place through 2030. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers, and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the "IRA") contains substantial drug pricing reforms, including the establishment of a drug price negotiation program within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that would require manufacturers to charge a negotiated "maximum fair price" for certain selected drugs or pay an excise tax for noncompliance, the establishment of rebate payment requirements on manufacturers of certain drugs payable under Medicare Parts B and D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation, and requires manufacturers to provide discounts on Part D drugs. Substantial penalties can be assessed for noncompliance with the drug pricing provisions in the IRA. The IRA could have the effect of reducing the prices we can charge and reimbursement we receive for our products, if approved, thereby reducing our profitability, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. The effects of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry in general is not yet known.
The ACA has been subject to challenges in the courts. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the "individual mandate" was repealed by Congress. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case to the Texas District Court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the entire ACA. An appeal was taken to the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the law as they had not alleged personal injury traceable to the allegedly unlawful conduct. As a result, the Supreme Court did not rule on the constitutionality of the ACA or any of its provisions.
Further changes to and under the ACA remain possible but it is unknown what form any such changes or any law proposed to replace or revise the ACA would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. We expect that changes to the ACA, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate prices and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry.
Table of Contents

At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
We expect that additional federal, state, and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party, or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts. Enforcement actions may be brought by the Department of Justice or the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and legislation has expanded the SEC's power to seek disgorgement in all FCPA cases filed in federal court and extended the statute of limitations in the SEC enforcement actions in intent-based claims such as those under FCPA from five years to ten years.
Health Canada
Health Canada is the Canadian federal authority that regulates, evaluates, and monitors the safety, effectiveness, and quality of drugs, medical devices, and other therapeutic products available to Canadians. Health Canada's regulatory process for review, approval, and regulatory oversight of products is similar to the regulatory process conducted by the FDA. To initiate clinical testing of a drug candidate in human subjects in Canada, a Clinical Trial Application ("CTA") must be filed with and approved by Health Canada. In addition, all federally regulated trials must be approved and monitored by research ethics boards ("REB"). The REB studies and approves study-related documents and monitors clinical trial data.
Prior to being given market authorization for a drug product, a manufacturer must present substantive scientific evidence of a product's safety, efficacy, and quality as required by the Food and Drugs Act and its associated regulations, including the Food and Drug Regulations ("FDR"). This information is usually submitted in the form of an NDS. Health Canada reviews the submitted information, sometimes using external consultants and advisory committees, to evaluate the potential benefits and risks of a drug. If after the review, the conclusion is that the patient benefits outweigh the risks associated with the drug, the drug is issued a Drug Identification Number ("DIN"), followed by a Notice of Compliance ("NOC"), which permits the market authorization holder (i.e., the NOC and DIN holder) to market the drug in Canada. Drugs granted an NOC may be subject to additional post-market surveillance and reporting requirements.
All establishments engaged in the fabrication, packaging/labeling, importation, distribution, and wholesale of drugs and operation of a testing laboratory relating to drugs are required to hold a Drug Establishment License ("DEL") to conduct one or more of the licensed activities unless expressly exempted under the FDR. The basis for the issuance of a DEL is to ensure the facility complies with current GMP as stipulated in the FDR and as determined by a current GMP inspection conducted by Health Canada. An importer of pharmaceutical products manufactured at foreign sites must also be able to demonstrate that the foreign sites comply with current GMP, and such foreign sites are included on the importer's DEL.
Regulatory obligations and oversight will continue to follow after the initial market approval of a pharmaceutical product. For example, every market authorization holder must report any new information received concerning adverse drug reactions, including timely reporting of serious adverse drug reactions that occur in Canada and any serious unexpected adverse drug reactions that occur outside of Canada. The market authorization holder must also notify Health Canada of any new safety and efficacy issues that it becomes aware of after the launch of a product.
The Canadian regulatory approval requirements for new drugs outlined above are similar to those of other major pharmaceutical markets. While the testing carried out in Canada is often acceptable for the purposes of regulatory submissions in other countries, individual regulatory authorities may request supplementary testing during their assessment of any submission. 
Table of Contents

Therefore, the clinical testing conducted under Health Canada's regulation may not be accepted by regulatory authorities outside Canada.
Regulation Outside of the United States and Canada
In addition to regulations in the U.S. and Canada, we may be subject to a variety of regulations in foreign jurisdictions that govern, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates, if approved, either directly or through our distribution partners. Whether or not we obtain FDA or Health Canada approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing and sale of the product in those countries. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the FDA and Health Canada approval process described above, and the time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA or Health Canada approval. Some foreign jurisdictions have a drug product approval process similar to that in the U.S. or Canada, which requires the submission of a CTA much like the IND application prior to the commencement of clinical studies. In Europe, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country's national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country's requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. To obtain regulatory approval of a therapeutic product candidate under EU regulatory systems, we would be required to submit a Marketing Authorisation Application, which is similar to the NDA, except that, among other things, there are country-specific documentation requirements. For countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, and recently the United Kingdom, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product approval, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in other countries. Moreover, some nations may not accept clinical studies performed for U.S. approval to support approval in their countries or require that additional studies be performed on natives of their countries. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the pricing of drug products is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable or insufficient. Resulting prices could be insufficient to generate an acceptable return to us or any future partner of ours. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution.
HUMAN CAPITAL
As of February 15, 2023, we had 84 employees, the majority of which were full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. In addition to our employees, we engage various consultants to support key areas of our business, including support of our research and development, manufacturing, and commercialization activities.
Talent Management
Our human capital is critical to the success of our mission to deliver new options for people facing serious disease and conditions. We consider the performance, skills, and intellectual capital of our employees to be an essential driver of this mission and a key to our future prospects. As such, we emphasize a number of measures and objectives in attracting, retaining, and developing our human capital, including, among others, employee safety, wellness, engagement, development, diversity and inclusion, and compensation and pay equity. In our employee recruitment process, we adhere to equal employment opportunity policies. We are committed to include diverse candidates in any pool of candidates from which employees are chosen. Additionally, we recognize that our employees perform best when they know how their work contributes to our overall strategy. To achieve this, we emphasize open and direct communication through the use of a variety of channels, including company-wide business updates and written communications from the leadership team.
Compensation and Benefits
Our compensation programs are designed to align our employees' interests with our achievement of our primary business goals. The salaries, bonuses, and opportunities for equity ownership provided to our employees are competitive within our industry and we engage outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry. The benefit options we provide are comprehensive and allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. All full-time employees are eligible for medical, dental, and vision insurance, paid time off, a 401(k) plan, and group life and disability coverage.

Employee Development and Leadership
The development of our employees is critical to our success. We believe that continued learning and development is an essential part to retaining our employees and creating a culture of learning and leadership. We encourage employees to participate and to take advantage of a variety of learning and development resources, including online skills courses, professional development events, and internal and external training programs based on individual needs.
Diversity and Inclusion
Each employee brings diverse perspectives, backgrounds, and thinking styles, and, by embracing and celebrating these differences, we strengthen our culture and further our mission. We are committed to preserving and further cultivating our diverse and inclusive workforce, including with respect to our leadership team and our Board of Directors ("Board"), to ensure an environment where employees feel empowered to achieve their fullest potential. Our current Board composition represents a deliberate mix of members who have a deep understanding of our business, as well as members who have different skill sets and points of view. In addition, we are in compliance with the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq") which requires a public company to have two diverse directors serve on the board, including at least one diverse director who self-identifies as female and at least one diverse director who self-identifies as an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ+.
We have an active Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ("DEI") Committee comprised of a diverse group of employees responsible for designing and implementing specific initiatives to promote greater diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. We are proud of the fact that our team includes 55% of employees in ethnic and racial minority groups and also that 45% of our employees are women, both as self-disclosed. We continue to focus on expanding our commitment to diversity and inclusion across our entire workforce, including working with managers to develop strategies for building diverse teams and promoting the advancement of employees from diverse backgrounds.
Values
We are guided by a commitment to accountability, respect, collaboration, and inclusivity. These principles drive the values of our employees and agents that enable us to propel the future of medical science. These values include:
•Act with urgency — The determination and speed necessary for people seeking new options where none now exist.
•Demonstrate ingenuity — The willingness and ability to explore the unknown, turn over every stone, and forge a new path.
•Show resolve — The drive to find solutions in the face of difficulty and adversity, and the grit to keep going, no matter what.
•Be bold — The confidence to challenge conventions and take risks, in the face of both failure and success, and move science in a new direction.
