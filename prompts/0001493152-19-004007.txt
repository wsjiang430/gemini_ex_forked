ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Andina Acquisition Corp. III
 
We are a Cayman Islands company incorporated on July 29, 2016 as an exempted company with limited liability. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies wishing to conduct business outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Law. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations shall apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.
 
We were incorporated for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic location, although we are currently focusing our search for target businesses in the Americas. While we expect to explore target businesses throughout the Americas that our management team finds attractive, our management team’s most extensive experience is with companies in Latin America. Within Latin America, we intend to focus on the countries with stable political and macro-economic frameworks which include: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru. We intend to capitalize on opportunities presented by high growth rates within these countries.
 
In July and August 2016, we issued an aggregate of 2,875,000 ordinary shares (“insider shares”) to B. Luke Weil, our Chairman, for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.009 per share. Subsequent to such date, Mr. Weil transferred shares to other individuals and entities, including the underwriters in our initial public offering (“IPO”), for the same price originally paid for such shares.
 
On January 31, 2019, we consummated the IPO of 10,800,000 units, including 800,000 units subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment option. Each unit consisted of one ordinary share, one right to receive one-tenth of one ordinary share, and one redeemable warrant, with each warrant entitling the holder to purchase one ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $108,000,000.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 395,000 Units (“Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $3,950,000, to certain of our initial shareholders and the joint book-running managers of the IPO and their respective affiliates. The Private Units are identical to the units sold in the IPO, except that the warrants underlying the Private Units are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial shareholders or their permitted transferees. The purchasers of the Private Units have agreed (A) to vote the ordinary shares underlying the Private Units in favor of any proposed business combination, (B) not to propose, or vote in favor of, an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association with respect to our pre-business combination activities prior to the consummation of such a business combination unless we provide public shareholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares in connection with any such vote, (C) not to convert any ordinary shares underlying the Private Units for cash from the trust account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination or a vote to amend the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, and (D) that the ordinary shares underlying the Private Units shall not participate in any liquidating distribution from the trust account upon winding up if a business combination is not consummated. The purchasers of Private Units have also agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except to certain permitted transferees) until the completion of our initial business combination.
