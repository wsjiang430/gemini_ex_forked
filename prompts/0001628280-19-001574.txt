Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a global leader in the development, manufacture and commercialization of innovative diagnostic medical imaging agents and products that assist clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular and other diseases. Clinicians use our imaging agents and products across a range of imaging modalities, including echocardiography and nuclear imaging. We believe that the resulting improved diagnostic information enables healthcare providers to better detect and characterize, or rule out, disease, potentially achieving improved patient outcomes, reducing patient risk and limiting overall costs for payers and the entire healthcare system. 
Our commercial products are used by cardiologists, nuclear physicians, radiologists, internal medicine physicians, technologists and sonographers working in a variety of clinical settings. 
We sell our products globally and operate our business in two reportable segments, which are further described below:

• | U.S. Segment produces and markets our medical imaging agents and products throughout the U.S. In the U.S., we primarily sell our products to radiopharmacies, integrated delivery networks, hospitals, clinics and group practices.


• | International Segment operations consist of production and distribution activities in Puerto Rico and some direct distribution activities in Canada. Additionally, within our International Segment, we have established and maintain third-party distribution relationships under which our products are marketed and sold in Europe, Canada, Australia, Asia-Pacific and Latin America.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold certain business units that were part of our International Segment. In January 2016, we entered into an asset purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold substantially all of our Canadian radiopharmacy business and Gludef manufacturing and distribution business. In August 2016, we entered into a share purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold all of the stock of our Australian radiopharmacy servicing subsidiary. See Note 6, “Sales of Certain International Segment Assets” included in the consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Product Portfolio
Our portfolio of ten commercial products is diversified across a range of imaging modalities. Our products include an ultrasound contrast agent and medical radiopharmaceuticals (including Technetium generators).

• | Ultrasound contrast agents are compounds that are used in diagnostic procedures, such as cardiac ultrasounds or echocardiograms, to improve the clarity of the diagnostic image.


• | Medical radiopharmaceuticals are radioactive pharmaceuticals used by clinicians to perform nuclear imaging procedures.


• | In certain circumstances, a radioactive element, or radioisotope, is attached to a chemical compound to form the radiopharmaceutical. This act of attaching the radioisotope to the chemical compound is called radiolabeling, or labeling.


• | In other circumstances, a radioisotope can be used as a radiopharmaceutical without attaching any additional chemical compound.


• | Radioisotopes are most commonly manufactured in a nuclear research reactor, where a target is bombarded with subatomic particles, or in a cyclotron, which is a type of particle accelerator that also creates radioisotopes.


• | Two common forms of nuclear imaging procedures are single-photon emission computed tomography (“SPECT”) which measures gamma rays emitted by a SPECT radiopharmaceutical, and positron emission tomography (“PET”) which measures positrons emitted by a PET radiopharmaceutical.

As an example of the procedures in which our products may be used, in the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, a typical diagnostic progression could include an electrocardiogram, followed by an echocardiogram (possibly using our agent DEFINITY) which delineates cardiac structure and function, and then a nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (“MPI”) study using either SPECT or PET imaging (possibly using our Technetium generator and our Cardiolite SPECT-based MPI agent). An MPI study assesses blood flow distribution to the heart. MPI is also used for diagnosing the presence of coronary artery disease.

DEFINITY and the Expansion of Our Ultrasound Microbubble Franchise 
DEFINITY is the leading ultrasound contrast imaging agent based on revenue and usage in the U.S., and is indicated for use in patients with suboptimal echocardiograms. Numerous patient conditions can decrease the quality of images of the left ventricle, the primary pumping chamber of the heart.
DEFINITY is a clear, colorless, sterile liquid, which, upon activation in a Vialmix apparatus, a medical device specifically designed for DEFINITY, becomes a homogenous, opaque, milky white injectable suspension of perflutren-containing lipid microspheres. After activation and intravenous injection, DEFINITY opacifies the left ventricular chamber and improves the delineation of the left ventricular endocardial border, or innermost layer of tissue that lines the chamber of the left ventricle. Better visualization of the left ventricle allows clinicians to make more informed decisions about disease status.
DEFINITY offers flexible dosing and administration through an IV bolus or diluted bolus injection or continuous IV infusion. We believe DEFINITY’s synthetic lipid-cased coating gives the agent a distinct competitive advantage, because it provides a strong ultrasound signal and is the only perflutren-based echo contrast agent made without albumin. 
There were approximately 33.7 million echocardiograms performed in the U.S. in 2018 according to a third party source. Assuming 20% of echocardiograms produce suboptimal images, as stated in the clinical literature, we estimate that approximately 6.7 million echocardiograms in 2018 produced suboptimal images. The use of DEFINITY during echocardiography allows physicians to significantly improve their assessment of the function of the left ventricle.
Since its launch in 2001, DEFINITY has been used in imaging procedures in more than 11.5 million patients throughout the world. We estimate that DEFINITY had over 80% share of the U.S. segment for contrast agents in echocardiography procedures as of December 2018. DEFINITY currently competes with Optison, a GE Healthcare product, Lumason, a Bracco product (known as SonoVue outside the U.S.) as well as echocardiography without contrast and non-echocardiography imaging modalities. DEFINITY, Optison and Lumason all carry an FDA-required boxed warning, which has been modified over time, to notify physicians and patients about potentially serious safety concerns or risks posed by the products. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Ultrasound contrast agents may cause side effects which could limit our ability to sell DEFINITY.”
As we continue to pursue expanding our microbubble franchise, our activities include:

• | Patents - We continue to actively pursue additional patents in connection with DEFINITY, both in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., we have an Orange Book-listed method of use patent expiring in March 2037. This patent augments an Orange Book-listed composition of matter patent expiring in June 2019, and additional manufacturing patents that are not Orange Book-listed expiring in 2021, 2023 and 2037. Outside of the U.S., our DEFINITY patent protection or regulatory exclusivity currently expires in 2019.

Hatch-Waxman Act - Even though our longest duration Orange Book-listed patent expires in March 2037, because our Orange Book-listed composition of matter patent expires in June 2019, we may face generic DEFINITY challengers in the near to intermediate term. Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, the FDA can approve Abbreviated New Drug Applications (“ANDAs”) for generic versions of drugs if the ANDA applicant demonstrates, among other things, that (i) its generic candidate is the same as the innovator product by establishing bioequivalence and providing relevant chemistry, manufacturing and product data, and (ii) the marketing of that generic candidate does not infringe an Orange Book-listed patent. With respect to any Orange Book-listed patent covering the innovator product, the ANDA applicant must give notice to the innovator (a “Notice”) that the ANDA applicant certifies that its generic candidate will not infringe the innovator’s Orange Book-listed patent or that the Orange Book-listed patent is invalid. The innovator can then challenge the ANDA applicant in court within 45 days of receiving such Notice, and FDA approval to commercialize the generic candidate will be stayed (that is, delayed) for up to 30 months while the patent dispute between the innovator and the ANDA applicant is resolved in court. The 30 month stay could potentially expire sooner if the courts determine that no infringement occurs or that the challenged Orange Book-listed patent is invalid or the parties otherwise settle their dispute.
As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not received any Notice from an ANDA applicant. If we were to (i) receive any such Notice in the future, (ii) bring a patent infringement suit against the ANDA applicant within 45 days of receiving such Notice, and (iii) successfully obtain the full 30 month stay, then the ANDA applicant would be precluded from commercializing a generic candidate prior to the expiration of such 30 month stay period and potentially thereafter depending on how a patent dispute is resolved. Solely by way of example and not based on any knowledge we currently have, if we received a Notice from an ANDA applicant in March 2019 and the full 30 month stay was obtained, then the ANDA applicant would be precluded from commercialization until at least September 2021. If we received a Notice some number of months in the future and the full 30 month stay was obtained, the commercialization date would roll forward in the future by the same calculation.

• | LVEF Indication - We are currently conducting two well-controlled Phase 3 studies designed to demonstrate improved accuracy of LVEF measurements with DEFINITY-enhanced echocardiography versus unenhanced echocardiography. The truth standard in these studies is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The studies will be conducted at 20 U.S. sites and will eventually enroll a total of approximately 300 subjects. We believe DEFINITY could improve the accuracy of LVEF calculations, giving clinicians greater confidence in patient management decisions. An LVEF indication could substantially increase the addressable market for contrast-enhanced echocardiography. We believe that DEFINITY, as the market leader, would benefit from the expanded addressable market. 


• | Modified Formulation - We are developing at SBL a modified formulation of DEFINITY. We believe this modified formulation will provide an enhanced product profile by enabling storage as well as shipment at room temperature (DEFINITY’s current formulation requires refrigerated storage), will give clinicians additional choice, and will allow for greater utility of this formulation in broader clinical settings. We were recently granted a composition of matter patent on the modified formulation which runs through December 2035. If the modified formulation is approved by the FDA, then this patent would be eligible to be listed in the Orange Book. We currently believe that, if approved by the FDA, the modified formulation could become commercially available in 2020, although that timing cannot be assured. Given its physical characteristics, the modified formulation may also be better suited for inclusion in kits requiring microbubbles for other indications and applications. 


• | New Applications - As we continue to look for other opportunities to expand our microbubble franchise, we are evaluating new indications and applications beyond echocardiography and contrast imaging generally.


• | In-House Manufacturing - We are currently building specialized in-house manufacturing capabilities at our North Billerica, Massachusetts facility for DEFINITY and, potentially, other sterile vial products. We believe the investment in these efforts will allow us to better control DEFINITY manufacturing and inventory, reduce our costs in a potentially more price competitive environment, and provide us with supply chain redundancy. We currently expect to be in a position to use this in-house manufacturing capability by early 2021, although that timing cannot be assured.

See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—The growth of our business is substantially dependent on our ability to continue to grow the appropriate use of DEFINITY in suboptimal echocardiograms in the face of increased segment competition from other existing echocardiography agents and potential generic competitors as a result of future patent and regulatory exclusivity expirations,” “—If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could develop and market products with features similar to our products, and demand for our products may decline,” and “—Our dependence upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of a substantial portion of our products could prevent us from delivering our products to our customers in the required quantities, within the required timeframes, or at all, which could result in order cancellations and decreased revenues.”
TechneLite
TechneLite is a self-contained system or generator of Technetium (“Tc99m”), a radioactive isotope with a six hour half-life, used by radiopharmacies to prepare various nuclear imaging agents. Technetium results from the radioactive decay of Moly, itself a radioisotope with a 66-hour half-life produced in nuclear research reactors around the world from enriched uranium. The TechneLite generator is a little larger than a coffee can in size, and the self-contained system houses a vertical glass column at its core that contains Moly. During our manufacturing process, Moly is added to the column within the generator where it is adsorbed onto alumina powder. The column is sterilized, enclosed in a lead shield and further sealed in a cylindrical plastic container, which is then immediately shipped to our radiopharmacy customers. Because of the short half-lives of Moly and Technetium, radiopharmacies typically purchase TechneLite generators on a weekly basis pursuant to standing orders.
The Technetium produced by our TechneLite generator is the medical radioisotope that can be attached to a number of imaging agents, including our own Cardiolite products and Neurolite, during the radiolabeling process. To radiolabel a Technetium-based radiopharmaceutical, a vial of sterile saline and a vacuum vial are each affixed to the top of a TechneLite generator. The sterile saline is pulled through the generator where it attracts Technetium resulting from the radioactive decay of Moly within the generator column. The Technetium-containing radioactive saline is then pulled into the vacuum vial and subsequently combined by a radiopharmacist with the applicable imaging agent, and individual patient-specific radiolabeled imaging agent doses are then prepared. When administered, the imaging agent binds to specific tissues or organs for a period of time, enabling the Technetium to illustrate the functional health of the imaged tissues or organs in a diagnostic image. Our ability to produce and market TechneLite is highly dependent on our supply of Moly. See “Raw Materials and Supply Relationships—Molybdenum-99” below.
5

TechneLite is produced in 13 sizes and is currently marketed primarily in North America and Latin America, largely to radiopharmacies that prepare unit doses of radiopharmaceutical imaging agents and ship these preparations directly to hospitals for administration to patients. In the U.S., we have supply contracts with the significant radiopharmacy groups, including Cardinal, UPPI, GE Healthcare and Triad. We also supply generators on a purchase order basis to other customers. We estimate that TechneLite had approximately one third of the U.S. generator market as of December 31, 2018, competing primarily with Technetium-based generators produced by Curium. In Puerto Rico, we also supply TechneLite to our wholly-owned radiopharmacy to prepare radiopharmaceutical imaging agent unit doses. 
In Canada, where we sold our radiopharmacies in January 2016, we have a supply agreement with Isologic Innovative Radiopharmaceuticals Ltd. (“Isologic”), the buyer of those radiopharmacies (the “Isologic Supply Agreement”). Under the Isologic Supply Agreement, we supply Isologic with certain of our products on commercial terms, including certain product purchase commitments by Isologic. The agreement expires in January 2021 and may be terminated upon the occurrence of specified events, including a material breach by the other party, bankruptcy by either party or certain force majeure events. In Australia, where we sold our radiopharmacy servicing business in August 2016, we have a supply agreement with Global Medical Solutions (“GMS”), the buyer of that business (the “GMS Supply Agreement”). Under the GMS Supply Agreement, we supply GMS with certain of our products on commercial terms, including certain minimum product purchase commitments by GMS. The agreement expires in August 2020 and may be terminated in whole or in part on a product-by-product basis upon the occurrence of specified events, including a material breach by the other party, bankruptcy by either party or certain force majeure events.
The Moly used in our TechneLite generators can be produced using targets made of either highly-enriched uranium (“HEU”) or low-enriched uranium (“LEU”). LEU consists of uranium that contains less than 20% of the uranium-235 isotope. HEU is often considered weapons grade material, with 20% or more of uranium-235. The American Medical Isotopes Production Act of 2012 encourages the domestic production of LEU Moly and provides for the eventual prohibition of the export of HEU from the U.S. Although Medicare generally does not provide separate payment to hospitals for the use of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals administered in an outpatient setting, since 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, has provided an add-on payment (of $10) under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system for every Technetium diagnostic dose produced from non-HEU sourced Moly, to cover the marginal cost for radioisotopes produced from non-HEU sources. Our LEU TechneLite generator satisfies the reimbursement requirements under the applicable CMS rules.
TechneLite has patent protection in the U.S. and various foreign countries on certain component technology currently expiring in 2029. In addition, given the significant know-how and trade secrets associated with the methods of manufacturing and assembling the TechneLite generator, we believe we have a substantial amount of valuable and defensible proprietary intellectual property associated with the product. We believe that our substantial capital investments in our highly automated TechneLite production line and our extensive experience in complying with the stringent regulatory requirements for the handling of nuclear materials create significant and sustainable competitive advantages for us in generator manufacturing and distribution.
Other Commercial Products
In addition to the products listed above, our portfolio of commercial products also includes important imaging agents in specific segments, which provide a stable base of recurring revenue. Most of these products have a favorable industry position as a result of our substantial infrastructure investment, specialized workforce, technical know-how and supplier and customer relationships.

• | Xenon Xe 133 Gas (“Xenon”) is a radiopharmaceutical gas that is inhaled and used to assess pulmonary function and also to image cerebral blood flow. Our Xenon is manufactured by a third party as a bi-product of Moly production and is processed and finished by us. We are currently the leading provider of Xenon in the U.S.


• | Neurolite is an injectable, Technetium-labeled imaging agent used with SPECT technology to identify the area within the brain where blood flow has been blocked or reduced due to stroke. We launched Neurolite in 1995.


• | Cardiolite, also known by its generic name sestamibi, is an injectable, Technetium-labeled imaging agent used in MPI procedures to assess blood flow to the muscle of the heart using SPECT. Cardiolite was approved by the FDA in 1990 and its market exclusivity expired in July 2008. Included in Cardiolite revenues are branded Cardiolite and generic sestamibi revenues.


• | Thallium TI 201 is an injectable radiopharmaceutical imaging agent used in MPI studies to detect cardiovascular disease. We have marketed Thallium since 1977 and manufacture the agent using cyclotron technology.


• | FDG is an injectable, fluorine-18-radiolabeled imaging agent used with PET technology to identify and characterize tumors in patients undergoing oncologic diagnostic procedures. We manufacture and distribute FDG from our Puerto Rico radiopharmacy.

6


• | Gallium (Ga 67) is an injectable radiopharmaceutical imaging agent used to detect certain infections and cancerous tumors, especially lymphoma. We manufacture Gallium using cyclotron technology.


• | Quadramet, our only therapeutic product, is an injectable radiopharmaceutical used to treat severe bone pain associated with osteoblastic metastatic bone lesions. We serve as the direct manufacturer and supplier of Quadramet in the U.S.


• | Cobalt (Co 57) is a non-pharmaceutical radiochemical used in the manufacture of sources for the calibration and maintenance of SPECT imaging cameras.

In the U.S. and Canada, we have a sales team of approximately 80 employees that call on healthcare providers in the echocardiography space, as well as radiopharmacy chains, integrated delivery networks and group purchasing organizations.
Our radiopharmaceutical products are sold in the U.S. through a subset of our sales team, primarily to radiopharmacies. We sell a majority of our radiopharmaceutical products in the U.S. to four radiopharmacy groups—namely Cardinal, UPPI, GE Healthcare and Triad. Our contractual distribution and other arrangements with these radiopharmacy groups are as follows:

• | Cardinal maintains approximately 131 radiopharmacies that are typically located in large, densely populated urban areas in the U.S. We estimate that Cardinal’s radiopharmacies distributed approximately 45% of the aggregate U.S. SPECT doses sold in the first half of 2018 (the latest information currently available to us). Our written supply agreement with Cardinal relating to TechneLite, Xenon, Neurolite and other products expires on December 31, 2019. The agreement specifies pricing levels and requirements to purchase minimum percentages of certain products during certain periods. The agreement may be terminated upon the occurrence of specified events, including a material breach by the other party and certain force majeure events.


• | UPPI is a cooperative purchasing group (roughly analogous to a group purchasing organization) of approximately 68 independently owned or smaller chain radiopharmacies located in the U.S. UPPI’s radiopharmacies are typically broadly dispersed geographically, with some urban presence and a substantial number of radiopharmacies located in suburban and rural areas of the country. We estimate that these independent radiopharmacies, together with approximately 33 unaffiliated, independent radiopharmacies, distributed approximately 24% of the aggregate U.S. SPECT doses sold in the first half of 2018. We currently have an agreement with UPPI for the distribution of TechneLite, Xenon and certain other products to radiopharmacies or families of radiopharmacies within the UPPI cooperative purchasing group. The agreement contains specified pricing levels based upon specified purchase amounts for UPPI. We are entitled to terminate the UPPI agreement upon 60 days written notice. The UPPI agreement expires on December 31, 2019.

7


• | GE Healthcare maintains approximately 31 radiopharmacies in the U.S. that purchase our TechneLite generators. We estimate that GE Healthcare distributed approximately 13% of the aggregate U.S. SPECT doses sold in the first half of 2018. We currently have an agreement with GE Healthcare for the distribution of TechneLite, Xenon and other products. The agreement provides that GE Healthcare will purchase a minimum percentage of TechneLite generators as well as certain other products from us. Our agreement, which expires on December 31, 2020, may be terminated by either party upon the occurrence of specified events including a material breach by either party, bankruptcy by either party, certain irresolvable regulatory changes or economic circumstances, or force majeure events.


• | Triad maintains approximately 56 radiopharmacies in the U.S. that purchase a range of our products. We estimate that Triad distributed approximately 12% of the aggregate U.S. SPECT doses sold in the first half of 2018. We currently have an agreement with Triad for the distribution of TechneLite, Xenon, Neurolite and other products. The agreement specifies pricing levels and percentage purchase requirements. The agreement will expire on December 31, 2020 and may be terminated upon the occurrence of specified events, including a material breach by the other party.

In addition to the distribution arrangements for our radiopharmaceutical products described above, we also sell certain of our radiopharmaceutical products to independent radiopharmacies and directly to hospitals and clinics that maintain in-house radiopharmaceutical capabilities and operations. In the latter case, this represents a small percentage of overall sales because the majority of hospitals and clinics do not maintain these in-house capabilities.
In Puerto Rico, we own and operate one of the two radiopharmacies on the island, where we sell our own products as well as products of third parties to end-users. In Canada, we operate some direct distribution activities.
In Europe, Canada, Australia, Asia-Pacific and Latin America, we utilize third party distributor relationships to market, sell and distribute our products, either on a country-by-country basis or on a multi-country regional basis.
In March 2012, we entered into a development and distribution arrangement for DEFINITY in China, Hong Kong and Macau with Double-Crane Pharmaceutical Company (“Double-Crane”). With Double-Crane’s support, we are currently pursuing the Chinese regulatory approval required to commercialize DEFINITY. In July 2013, we submitted a clinical trial application to the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (“CFDA”) seeking an Import Drug License. After a very extensive waiting period caused by a large number of drugs seeking CFDA regulatory approval, in February 2016, the CFDA approved our clinical trial application. Double-Crane is conducting on our behalf three confirmatory clinical trials in pursuit of cardiac, liver and kidney imaging indications, as well as one small pharmacokinetic study, and enrollment has been completed for all the studies. The study results are currently being analyzed, and then the application to the CFDA for an Import Drug License will be prepared and submitted, which we currently estimate will occur in 2019.
Seasonality
Our business has modest seasonality as patients may seek to schedule non-urgent diagnostic imaging procedures less frequently during the summer vacation months and over the year-end holidays.
Customers
No customer accounted for greater than 10% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Backlog
Our backlog consists of orders for which a delivery schedule within the next twelve months has been specified. Orders included in backlog may be canceled or rescheduled by customers at any time with the exception of TechneLite orders. For TechneLite, customers must provide us with four weeks advanced notice to cancel an order. We do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is meaningful because it has historically been immaterial relative to our consolidated revenues and is not necessarily indicative of future revenues for any given period.
Competition
We believe that our key product characteristics, such as proven efficacy, reliability and safety, coupled with our core competencies, such as our efficient manufacturing processes, our established distribution network, our experienced field sales organization and our customer service focus, are important factors that distinguish us from our competitors.
8

The market for diagnostic medical imaging agents is highly competitive and continually evolving. Our principal competitors in existing diagnostic modalities include large, global companies that are more diversified than we are and that have substantial financial, manufacturing, sales and marketing, distribution and other resources. These competitors currently include Curium, GE Healthcare, Bracco and Jubilant Life Sciences, an affiliate of JHS, as well as other competitors, including NorthStar Medical Radioisotopes. We cannot anticipate their competitive actions in the same or competing diagnostic modalities, such as significant price reductions on products that are comparable to our own, development of new products that are more cost-effective or have superior performance than our current products or the introduction of generic versions after our proprietary products lose their current patent protection. In addition, distributors of our products could attempt to shift end-users to competing diagnostic modalities and products, or bundle the sale of a portfolio of products to the detriment of our specific products. Our current or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical as a result of these activities.
Raw Materials and Supply Relationships
We rely on certain raw materials and supplies to produce our products. Due to the specialized nature of our products and the limited, and sometimes intermittent, supply of raw materials available in the market, we have established relationships with several key suppliers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our largest suppliers of raw materials and supplies were Institute for Radioelements (“IRE”), ANSTO and NTP, which, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 27% of our total purchases.
Molybdenum-99
Our TechneLite, Cardiolite and Neurolite products all rely on Moly, the radioisotope which is produced by bombarding uranium with neutrons in research reactors. With a 66-hour half-life, Moly decays into, among other things, Technetium-99m (Tc-99m), another radioisotope with a half-life of six hours. Tc-99m is the isotope that is attached to radiopharmaceuticals, including our own Cardiolite and Neurolite, during the labeling process and is the most common radioisotope used for medical diagnostic imaging purposes.
We currently purchase finished Moly from three of the four main processing sites in the world, namely, IRE in Belgium, ANSTO in Australia, and NTP in South Africa. These processing sites provide us Moly from five of the six main Moly-producing reactors in the world, namely, OPAL in Australia, BR2 in Belgium, LVR-15 in the Czech Republic, HFR in The Netherlands, and SAFARI in South Africa.
Our agreement with NTP (the “NTP Agreement”), with NTP acting for itself and on behalf of its subcontractor ANSTO, specifies LMI’s percentage purchase requirements and unit pricing, and provides for the supply of Moly derived from LEU targets from NTP and ANSTO. ANSTO has under construction a new Moly processing facility that ANSTO believes will increase its production capacity from approximately 2,000 curies per week to 3,500 curies per week. ANSTO has indicated that it is currently planning to start commercial production in the first half of 2019. The NTP Agreement allows for termination upon the occurrence of certain events, including failure by NTP to provide our required amount of Moly, material breach of any provision by either party, bankruptcy by either party or force majeure events. The NTP Agreement expires on December 31, 2020.
Similar to the NTP Agreement, our agreement with IRE (the “IRE Agreement”) contains minimum percentage volume requirements and unit pricing. The IRE Agreement also requires IRE to provide certain favorable allocations of Moly during periods of supply shortage or failure. The IRE Agreement also provides for an increased supply of Moly derived from LEU targets upon IRE’s completion of its ongoing conversion program to modify its facilities and processes in accordance with Belgian nuclear security commitments. The IRE Agreement allows for termination upon the occurrence of certain events, including failure by IRE to provide our required amount of Moly, material breach of any provision by either party, bankruptcy by either party or force majeure events. The IRE Agreement expires on December 31, 2019, and is renewable by LMI on a year-to-year basis thereafter.
We believe we are generally well-positioned with ANSTO, IRE and NTP to have a diverse, global Moly supply, including LEU-based Moly. However, we still face challenges in our Moly supply chain. The NTP processing facility was off-line from late November 2017 until mid-February 2018 and again from early June 2018 through mid-November 2018. During the periods when NTP was not producing, we relied on Moly supply from both IRE and ANSTO to limit the impact of the NTP outage. However, we were unable to fill all of the demand for our TechneLite generators on certain manufacturing days. To further augment and diversify our current supply, we are pursuing additional sources of Moly from potential new producers around the world that seek to produce Moly with existing or new reactors or technologies. For example, in November 2014, we entered into a strategic agreement with SHINE Medical Technologies, Inc. (“SHINE”), a Wisconsin-based company, for the future supply of Moly. Under the terms of the supply agreement, SHINE will provide Moly produced using its proprietary LEU-solution technology for use in our TechneLite generators once SHINE’s facility becomes operational and receives all necessary regulatory approvals, which SHINE now estimates will occur in 2021. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—The global supply of Moly is fragile and not stable. Our dependence on a limited number of third party suppliers for Moly could prevent us from delivering some of our products to our customers in the required quantities, within the required timeframe, or at all, which could result in order cancellations and decreased revenues.”
9

Xenon
Xenon is a by-product of the Moly production process. Under a strategic agreement we entered into in 2015, we receive from IRE bulk unprocessed Xenon, which we process and finish for our customers at our North Billerica, Massachusetts manufacturing facility. Until we can qualify an additional source of bulk unprocessed Xenon, we will rely on IRE as a sole source provider. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Our dependence upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of a substantial portion of our products could prevent us from delivering our products to our customers in the required quantities, within the required timeframes, or at all, which could result in order cancellations and decreased revenues.”
Other Materials
We have additional supply arrangements for active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients, packaging materials and other materials and components, none of which are exclusive, but a number of which are sole source, and all of which we currently believe are either in good standing or replaceable without any material disruption to our business.
Manufacturing
We maintain manufacturing operations at our North Billerica, Massachusetts facility. We manufacture TechneLite on a highly automated production line, Thallium and Gallium and certain radiochemicals using our cyclotron technology, and we process and finish Xenon and Quadramet using our hot cell infrastructure. We also maintain manufacturing operations at our San Juan, Puerto Rico radiopharmacy and PET manufacturing facility where we manufacture FDG using cyclotron technology. We manufacture, finish and distribute our radiopharmaceutical products on a just-in-time basis, and supply our customers with these products either by next day delivery services or by either ground or air custom logistics. We believe that our substantial capital investments in our highly automated generator production line, our cyclotrons and our extensive experience in complying with the stringent regulatory requirements for the handling of nuclear materials and operations in a highly regulated environment create significant and sustainable competitive advantages for us.
In addition to our in-house manufacturing capabilities, a substantial portion of our products are manufactured by third party contract manufacturing organizations, and in certain instances, we rely on them for sole source manufacturing. To ensure the quality of the products that are manufactured by third parties, the key raw materials used in those products are first sent to our North Billerica, Massachusetts facility, where we test them prior to the third party manufacturing of the final product. After the final products are manufactured, they are sent back to us for final quality control testing and then we ship them to our customers. We have expertise in the design, development and validation of complex manufacturing systems and processes, and our strong execution and quality control culture supports the just-in-time manufacturing model at our North Billerica, Massachusetts facility. 
We have also commenced an extensive, multi-year effort to add specialized manufacturing capabilities at our North Billerica, Massachusetts facility.  This project is part of a larger corporate growth strategy to create a competitive advantage in specialized manufacturing. This project should not only deliver efficiencies and supply chain redundancy for our current portfolio but should also afford us increased flexibility as we consider external opportunities. We currently expect to be in a position to use this in-house manufacturing capability by early 2021. However, we can give no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts or that we will be able to successfully manufacture any additional commercial products at our North Billerica, Massachusetts facility.
Manufacturing and Supply Arrangements
We currently have the following technology transfer and manufacturing and supply agreements in place for some of our major products:

• | DEFINITY—In February 2012, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with JHS, for the manufacture of DEFINITY. Under the agreement, JHS manufactured DEFINITY for us for an initial term of five years. In September 2016, we extended the agreement through January 2022. The agreement contains automatic renewals for additional one-year periods thereafter. The agreement allows for termination upon the occurrence of certain events such as a material breach or default by either party, or bankruptcy by either party. The agreement also requires us to place orders for a minimum percentage of our requirements for DEFINITY with JHS. Based on our current projections, we believe that we will have sufficient supply of DEFINITY from JHS to meet expected demand.

On May 3, 2016, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with SBL to perform technology transfer and process development services to manufacture and supply a modified formulation of DEFINITY. There are no minimum purchase requirements under this agreement, which has an initial term of five years from the date of first commercial sale and is renewable at our option for an additional five years. This agreement allows for termination upon the occurrence of certain events, including material breach or bankruptcy of either party. We cannot give any assurances as to when those technology transfer activities will be completed and when we will begin to receive supply of a modified formulation of DEFINITY from SBL.

• | Cardiolite—In May 2012, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with JHS for the manufacture of Cardiolite products. In the third quarter of 2016, we completed the technology transfer process and received FDA approval to manufacture Cardiolite at JHS. Under the agreement, JHS has agreed to manufacture products for an initial term of five years from the effective date. On November 9, 2017, we extended the term until December 31, 2020, and the agreement can be further extended for three additional one-year periods thereafter so long as the parties, using good faith, reasonable efforts, agree to new pricing for the upcoming additional term. The agreement allows for termination upon the occurrence of specified events, including material breach or bankruptcy by either party. The agreement requires us to place orders for 100% of our requirements for Cardiolite products with JHS during such term. Based on our current projections, we believe that we will have sufficient supply of Cardiolite products from JHS to meet expected demand.


• | Neurolite—In May 2012, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with JHS for the manufacture of Neurolite, and in January 2015, the FDA granted approval to manufacture Neurolite at JHS. Under the agreement, JHS agreed to manufacture Neurolite for an initial term of five years from the effective date. On November 9, 2017, we extended the term of the agreement until December 31, 2020, and the agreement can be further extended for three additional one-year periods thereafter so long as the parties, using good faith, reasonable efforts, agree to new pricing for the upcoming additional term. The agreement allows for termination upon the occurrence of specified events, including material breach or bankruptcy by either party. The agreement also requires us to place orders for 100% of our requirements for Neurolite during such term. Based on our current projections, we believe that we will have sufficient supply of Neurolite from JHS to meet expected demand.

Although we are pursuing additional third party manufacturing relationships to establish and secure additional long-term or alternative suppliers as described above, we are uncertain of the timing as to when these arrangements could provide meaningful quantities of our products. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Our dependence upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of a substantial portion of our products could prevent us from delivering our products to our customers in the required quantities, within the required timeframes, or at all, which could result in order cancellations and decreased revenues,” “—Challenges with product quality or product performance, including defects, caused by us or our suppliers could result in a decrease in customers and revenues, unexpected expenses and loss of market share,” and “—Our business and industry are subject to complex and costly regulations. If government regulations are interpreted or enforced in a manner adverse to us or our business, we may be subject to enforcement actions, penalties, exclusion and other material limitations on our operations.”
Campus Strategy
We continually evaluate our extensive physical assets on our North Billerica, Massachusetts campus to optimize the carrying costs and use of these assets. In February 2018, we sold an approximately six-acre parcel of undeveloped land adjacent to our manufacturing facilities and certain of our administrative offices. Later in 2018, we razed an uneconomical and underutilized building on our North Billerica, Massachusetts campus to achieve operating efficiencies. To house our proposed new, specialized manufacturing capabilities, we are retrofitting a currently underutilized manufacturing and storage building.
Clinical Development
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we invested $17.1 million, $18.1 million and $12.2 million in research and development (“R&D”), respectively. Our R&D team includes our Medical Affairs and Medical Information functions, which educate physicians on the scientific aspects of our commercial products and the approved indications, labeling and the receipt of reports relating to product quality or adverse events. In addition to the DEFINITY clinical trials in China described above, we now have three active clinical development programs which we are either leading or in which we are collaborating. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—The process of developing new drugs and obtaining regulatory approval is complex, time-consuming and costly, and the outcome is not certain.”
DEFINITY - New Clinical Trials for Additional Indication - LVEF
As part of our microbubble franchise strategy, we are currently conducting two well-controlled Phase 3 studies designed to demonstrate improved accuracy of LVEF measurements with DEFINITY-enhanced echocardiography versus unenhanced echocardiography. The truth standard in these Phase 3 studies is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The studies will be conducted at 20 U.S. sites and will eventually enroll a total of approximately 300 subjects.
LVEF measures the percentage of blood leaving the left ventricle with each contraction and is an important measurement of heart function. LVEF may decrease if there is weakness in the heart muscle as a result of a heart attack, a genetic predisposition, heart valve or other disease, or long-standing, uncontrolled hypertension. We believe that accurate LVEF measurements are critical to clinical decision-making and patient management. Although unenhanced echocardiography is the most frequently used modality to determine LVEF in clinical practice, it has been hampered by its poor accuracy and reproducibility. We believe that DEFINITY-enhanced echocardiography could produce LVEF measurements that are superior to unenhanced echocardiography, potentially providing a clinician greater confidence in diagnosing and treating patients.
11

An LVEF indication could also substantially increase the addressable market for contrast-enhanced echocardiography. We believe that DEFINITY, as the market leader, would benefit from the expanded addressable market. However, we can give no assurances that these clinical trials will be successful or that there will be an increase in unit sales of DEFINITY as a result of an LVEF indication.
Flurpiridaz F 18—PET Myocardial Perfusion
We have developed flurpiridaz F 18, an internally discovered small molecule radiolabeled with fluorine-18, as an imaging agent used in PET MPI to assess blood flow to the heart.
Today, most MPI procedures use SPECT technology. Although SPECT imaging used in conjunction with a radiopharmaceutical imaging agent, such as Cardiolite, is most commonly used for MPI studies, PET imaging has gained considerable support in the field of cardiovascular imaging as it offers many advantages to SPECT imaging, including: higher image quality, increased diagnostic certainty, more accurate risk stratification and reduced patient radiation exposure. PET imaging has demonstrated broad utility for diagnosis, prognosis, disease staging and therapeutic response. When used in combination with an appropriate radiopharmaceutical imaging agent, PET imaging can provide important insights into physiologic and metabolic processes in the body and be useful in evaluating a variety of conditions including heart disease, neurological disease and cancer. In addition, PET MPI imaging could be particularly useful in difficult-to-image patients, including women and obese patients. The use of PET technology in MPI tests represents a broad emerging application for a technology more commonly associated with oncology and neurology. We anticipate that the adoption of PET technology in MPI tests will increase significantly in the future.
Flurpiridaz F 18 Clinical Overview and Phase 3 Program
We submitted an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) for flurpiridaz F 18 to the FDA in August 2006. Our clinical program to date has consisted of three Phase 1 studies, a Phase 2 clinical trial, conducted from 2007 to 2010, involving 176 subjects who received PET MPI performed with flurpiridaz F 18 and completed the trial, and a Phase 3 clinical trial (“301 Trial”) conducted from 2011 to 2013.
The 301 Trial was an open-label, multicenter, international study with 755 subjects with known or suspected coronary artery disease (“CAD”) and scheduled for coronary angiography and SPECT imaging who completed the trial and were included in the efficacy analysis. Subjects underwent flurpiridaz F 18 PET MPI and SPECT MPI studies with coronary angiography used as the truth standard for each. The study then compared MPI imaging using flurpiridaz F 18 versus SPECT imaging with primary endpoints of superiority for sensitivity (identifying disease) and non-inferiority for specificity (ruling out disease).
In the fourth quarter of 2013, we announced preliminary results from the 301 Trial, and in May 2015, after a re-read of the 301 Trial results, we announced the complete results from the 301 Trial. Flurpiridaz F 18 appeared to be well-tolerated from a safety perspective, and PET MPI with flurpiridaz F 18 consistently showed a balanced performance in sensitivity and specificity, when compared to coronary angiography, while SPECT imaging results were skewed with low sensitivity and high specificity when compared to coronary angiography. When results were compared to one another, flurpiridaz F 18 imaging substantially outperformed SPECT imaging in sensitivity but did not meet the non-inferiority endpoint in specificity, implying a substantial and unexpected under-diagnosis of CAD with SPECT imaging in the trial.
In subgroup analyses, the risk-benefit profile of flurpiridaz F 18 appeared to be favorable in women, obese patients, patients with multi-vessel disease and diabetics. A significantly higher percentage of images were rated as either excellent or good with flurpiridaz F 18 imaging as compared to SPECT imaging, leading to a greater diagnostic certainty of interpretation. Importantly, radiation exposure associated with flurpiridaz F 18 imaging was reduced to approximately 50% of SPECT imaging. In addition, no drug-related serious adverse events were observed.
GE Healthcare Collaboration
In April 2017, we announced that we entered into a definitive, exclusive Collaboration and License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with GE Healthcare for the continued Phase 3 development and worldwide commercialization of flurpiridaz F 18. Under the License Agreement, GE Healthcare will complete the worldwide development of flurpiridaz F 18, pursue worldwide regulatory approvals and, if successful, lead a worldwide launch and commercialization of the agent, with us collaborating on both development and commercialization through a joint steering committee.
12

The second Phase 3 clinical trial is underway, as a prospective, open-label, international, multi-center trial of flurpiridaz F 18 for PET MPI in patients referred for invasive coronary angiography because of suspected CAD. The trial will enroll up to 650 participants, with a target completion date in the second half of 2020, although that timing cannot be assured. The primary outcome measure for the trial is the diagnostic efficacy of flurpiridaz F 18 PET MPI in the detection of significant CAD, with secondary outcome measures of diagnostic efficacy of flurpiridaz F 18 PET MPI compared with SPECT MPI in the detection of CAD in all patients. Secondary analysis will be performed in patients of special clinical interest, such as female, obese and diabetic patients, where current SPECT MPI technologies have shown certain limitations in the diagnostic performance.
LMI 1195 (flubrobenguan F18)-Cardiac Neuronal Imaging Agent
We have developed LMI 1195, an internally discovered small molecule that we believe may be a first-in-class fluorine-18-based PET radiopharmaceutical imaging agent that could be a useful tool in the diagnostic assessment of ischemic heart failure patients at risk of sudden cardiac death. Heart failure is associated with changes in the cardiac sympathetic nerve function leading to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.  To prevent fatal arrhythmic events, implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are implanted in heart failure patients meeting specific criteria.  However, currently available tools to identify the most appropriate population for ICD implantation have limited predictive value, and only a small percentage of patients currently benefits from the procedure.  We believe that a test that would identify a subset of patients at very low risk of sudden cardiac death would lead to improved targeted utilization of the devices and reduce the physical and financial consequences of inappropriate implantation.  
The cardiac neuronal norepinephrine transporter, or NET, has been shown to be a useful target for the non-invasive monitoring of the cardiac sympathetic status and the assessment of the likelihood of a heart failure patient to develop fatal arrhythmias. Nuclear cardiac imaging provides a unique tool to measure the molecular changes in the heart, including cardiac function of NET, in a non-invasive and repeatable manner. We developed LMI 1195 to target the NET and are encouraged by initial results. 
Collaborations with academic centers in the U.S., Canada and Europe have yielded clinical data that have been deemed adequate by the FDA to support advancing into a single Phase 3 clinical trial for an NDA submission. We have also made substantial progress in our discussions with authorities on the study design as well as the future reimbursement environment. This program would target patients with ischemic heart failure that are scheduled to undergo ICD implantation because of their risk of sudden cardiac death and would be designed to demonstrate that LMI 1195 improves the risk stratification of these patients.
Ongoing academic collaborations focusing on establishing the potential use of LMI 1195 for the diagnosis and treatment follow-up of neuroendocrine tumors, such as pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas, have also produced initial proof of concept data that is being pursued further for possible clinical development.
Strategic Activities
To further expand and diversify our business, we are pursuing external opportunities that fit our growth and profitability objectives. Our current focus is on the broader imaging agent space and therapeutic adjacencies.
Intellectual Property
Patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, both in the U.S. and foreign countries, are very important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, technological innovations, licensing agreements and confidentiality agreements to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property owned by others. Our ability to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the U.S., which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in those countries by utilizing technologies that are similar to those developed or licensed by us. Competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights. If we do not obtain sufficient protection for our intellectual property, or if we are unable to effectively enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitiveness could be impaired, which would limit our growth and future revenue. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could develop and market products with features similar to our products, and demand for our products may decline.”
Trademarks, Service Marks and Trade Names
We own various trademarks, service marks and trade names, including, among others, DEFINITY, TechneLite, Cardiolite, Neurolite, Vialmix, Quadramet, Luminity and Lantheus Medical Imaging. We have registered these trademarks, as well as others, in the U.S. and/or numerous foreign jurisdictions.

Patents
We actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including chemical species, compositions and formulations, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, as new intellectual property is developed. In addition to seeking patent protection in the U.S., we file patent applications in numerous foreign countries in order to further protect the inventions that we consider important to the development of our international business. We also rely upon trade secrets and contracts to protect our proprietary information. As of December 31, 2018, our patent portfolio included a total of 42 issued U.S. patents, 261 issued foreign patents, 23 pending patent applications in the U.S. and 175 pending foreign applications. These patents and patent applications include claims covering the composition of matter and methods of use for all of our preclinical and clinical stage agents.
We have patent protection on certain of our commercial products and on all of our clinical development candidates. We typically seek patent protection in major markets around the world, including, among others, the U.S., Canada, Western Europe, Asia, and Latin America. 
DEFINITY - We continue to actively pursue additional patents in connection with DEFINITY, both in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., we have an Orange Book-listed method of use patent expiring in March 2037. This patent augments an Orange Book-listed composition of matter patent expiring in June 2019, and additional manufacturing patents that are not Orange Book-listed expiring in 2021, 2023 and 2037. Outside of the U.S., our DEFINITY patent protection or regulatory exclusivity currently expires in 2019. We were also recently granted a composition of matter patent on the modified formulation of DEFINITY which runs through December 2035. If the modified formulation is approved by the FDA, then this patent would be eligible to be listed in the Orange Book.
Even though our longest duration Orange Book-listed patent expires in March 2037, because our Orange Book-listed composition of matter patent expires in June 2019, we may face generic DEFINITY challengers in the near to intermediate term. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the FDA can approve ANDAs for generic versions of drugs if the ANDA applicant demonstrates, among other things, that (i) its generic candidate is the same as the innovator product by establishing bioequivalence and providing relevant chemistry, manufacturing and product data, and (ii) the marketing of that generic candidate does not infringe an Orange Book-listed patent. With respect to any Orange Book-listed patent covering the innovator product, the ANDA applicant must give Notice to the innovator that the ANDA applicant certifies that its generic candidate will not infringe the innovator’s Orange Book-listed patent or that the Orange Book-listed patent is invalid. The innovator can then challenge the ANDA applicant in court within 45 days of receiving such Notice, and FDA approval to commercialize the generic candidate will be stayed (that is, delayed) for up to 30 months while the patent dispute between the innovator and the ANDA applicant is resolved in court. The 30 month stay could potentially expire sooner if the courts determine that no infringement occurs or that the challenged Orange Book-listed patent is invalid or the parties otherwise settle their dispute.
As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not received any Notice from an ANDA applicant. If we were to (i) receive any such Notice in the future, (ii) bring a patent infringement suit against the ANDA applicant within 45 days of receiving such Notice, and (iii) successfully obtain the full 30 month stay, then the ANDA applicant would be precluded from commercializing a generic candidate prior to the expiration of such 30 month stay period and potentially thereafter depending on how a patent dispute is resolved. Solely by way of example and not based on any knowledge we currently have, if we received a Notice from an ANDA applicant in March 2019 and the full 30 month stay was obtained, then the ANDA applicant would be precluded from commercialization until at least September 2021. If we received a Notice some number of months in the future and the full 30 month stay was obtained, the commercialization date would roll forward in the future by the same calculation.
TechneLite - We currently have patent protection in the U.S. and various foreign countries on certain component technology expiring in 2029. In addition, given the significant know-how and trade secrets associated with the methods of manufacturing and assembling the TechneLite generator, we believe we have a substantial amount of valuable and defensible proprietary intellectual property associated with the product. 
Other Nuclear Products - Neither Cardiolite nor Neurolite is covered any longer by patent protection in either the U.S. or the rest of the world. Xenon, Thallium and Gallium have no patent protection; however, we are pursuing patent protection for an improved container for Xenon.
Clinical Development Candidates - We have patents and patent applications in numerous jurisdictions covering composition, use, formulation and manufacturing of flurpiridaz F 18, including in the U.S. a composition patent expiring in 2026, a method of use patent expiring in 2028 and a method of manufacturing patent expiring in 2031, in the absence of any regulatory extension, and various patent applications, one of which, if granted, will expire in 2033 in the absence of any patent term adjustment or regulatory extensions. We also have patents and patent applications in numerous jurisdictions covering composition, use, and manufacture of LMI 1195, including in the U.S. a composition patent expiring in 2030, a method of use patent expiring in 2027, and manufacturing-related patents expiring in 2031 and 2032, in the absence of any regulatory extension, and patent applications which, if granted, will expire in 2027 and in 2031 in the absence of any patent term adjustment or regulatory extensions. 
14

In addition to patents, we rely where necessary upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how, proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees, consultants and other third parties and invention assignment agreements with our employees. These confidentiality agreements may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information, and we cannot provide assurances that an employee or an outside party will not make an unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets, other technical know-how or proprietary information. We may not have adequate monitoring abilities to discover, or adequate remedies for, any unauthorized disclosure. This might happen intentionally or inadvertently. It is possible that a competitor will make use of such information, and that our competitive position will be compromised, in spite of any legal action we might take against persons making such unauthorized disclosures. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
In addition, we license a limited number of third party technologies and other intellectual property rights that are incorporated into some elements of our drug discovery and development efforts. These licenses are not material to our business, and the technologies can be obtained from multiple sources. We are currently party to separate royalty-free, non-exclusive, cross-licenses with each of Bracco, GE Healthcare and Imcor Pharmaceutical Company. These cross-licenses give us freedom to operate in connection with contrast enhanced ultrasound imaging technology.
Regulatory Matters
Food and Drug Laws
The development, manufacture and commercialization of our agents and products are subject to comprehensive governmental regulation both within and outside the U.S. A number of factors substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining the approval to market newly developed and existing products. These factors include governmental regulation, such as detailed inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, manufacturing, marketing, sampling, distribution, import and export, record keeping and storage and disposal practices, together with various post-marketing requirements. Governmental regulatory actions can result in the seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for their production and sale as well as other civil or criminal sanctions.
Our activities related to the development, manufacture, packaging or repackaging of our pharmaceutical and medical device products subject us to a wide variety of laws and regulations. We are required to register for permits and/or licenses with, seek approvals from and comply with operating and security standards of the FDA, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), Health Canada, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”), the CFDA and various state and provincial boards of pharmacy, state and provincial controlled substance agencies, state and provincial health departments and/or comparable state and provincial agencies, as well as foreign agencies, and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale.
The FDA and various state regulatory authorities regulate the research, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket approval, marketing, advertising and promotion, import and export and sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products in the U.S. Prior to marketing a pharmaceutical product, we must first receive FDA approval. In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Currently, the process required by the FDA before a drug product may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

• | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices regulations;


• | Submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin, including review and approval by any individual review board (“IRB”), serving any of the institutions participating in the clinical studies;


• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to Good Clinical Practices and other requirements, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for its intended use;


• | Submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, for a new drug;


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”) regulations; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.

15

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our agents in development will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Once a pharmaceutical agent is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation, and stability, as well as animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy. This testing culminates in the submission of the IND to the FDA.
Once the IND becomes effective, including review and approval by any IRB, serving any of the institutions participating in the clinical trial, the clinical trial program may begin. Each new clinical trial protocol must be submitted to the FDA before the study may begin. Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1. The agent is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the agent may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with those diseases.


• | Phase 2. Involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the agent for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.


• | Phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to collect sufficient safety and efficacy data to support the NDA for FDA approval.

Clinical trial sponsors may request an SPA from the FDA. The FDA’s SPA process creates a written agreement between the sponsoring company and the FDA regarding the clinical trial design and other clinical trial issues that can be used to support approval of an agent. The SPA is intended to provide assurance that, if the agreed-upon clinical trial protocols are followed and the trial endpoints are achieved, then the data may serve as the primary basis for an efficacy claim in support of an NDA. However, the SPA agreement is not a guarantee of an approval of an agent or any permissible claims about the agent. In particular, the SPA is not binding on the FDA if public health concerns become evident that are unrecognized at the time that the SPA agreement is entered into, other new scientific concerns regarding product safety or efficacy arise, or if the clinical trial sponsor fails to comply with the agreed upon clinical trial protocols.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. Submissions must also be made to inform the FDA of certain changes to the clinical trial protocol. Federal law also requires the sponsor to register the trials on public databases when they are initiated, and to disclose the results of the trials on public databases upon completion. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, any IRB serving any of the institutions participating in the clinical trial can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at a relevant institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the agent has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Failure to register a clinical trial or disclose study results within the required time periods could result in penalties, including civil monetary penalties.
Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the agent and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the agent does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug product, proposed labeling, and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug, requesting approval to market the agent. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee. A waiver of that fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. The FDA has substantial discretion in the product approval process, and it is impossible to predict whether and when the FDA will grant marketing approval. The FDA may on occasion require the sponsor of an NDA to conduct additional clinical studies or to provide other scientific or technical information about the product, and these additional requirements may lead to unanticipated delay or expense. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
16

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess a drug product’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. The FDA also may impose a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to ensure that the benefits of a product outweigh its risks. A REMS could add training requirements for healthcare professionals, safety communications efforts and limits on channels of distribution, among other things. The sponsor would be required to evaluate and monitor the various REMS activities and adjust them if need be. Whether a REMS would be imposed on any of our products and any resulting financial impact is uncertain at this time.
Any drug products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on drug products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and consistent with the provisions of the approved label and promotional claims must be appropriately balanced with important safety information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Further, manufacturers of drugs must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented, and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
Drug product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain other agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release. In addition, manufacturers of commercial PET products, including radiopharmacies, hospitals and academic medical centers, are required to submit either an NDA or ANDA in order to produce PET drugs for clinical use, or produce the drugs under an IND.
The FDA also regulates the preclinical and clinical testing, design, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, sales and distribution, post-market adverse event reporting, import/export and advertising and promotion of any medical devices that we distribute pursuant to the FDCA and FDA’s implementing regulations. The Federal Trade Commission shares jurisdiction with the FDA over the promotion and advertising of certain medical devices. The FDA can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution or use of medical devices at the time of their clearance or approval, or subsequent to marketing. Currently, two medical devices, both of which are manufactured by third parties that hold the product clearances, comprise only a small portion of our revenues.
The FDA may withdraw marketing authorization for a pharmaceutical or medical device product if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, civil monetary penalties, warning letters, holds on clinical studies, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of pharmaceuticals or medical device products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties.
Because our operations include the manufacture and distribution of medical radioisotopes and other medical products, we are subject to regulation by the NRC and the departments of health of each state in which we operate and the applicable state boards of pharmacy. In addition, the FDA is also involved in the regulation of cyclotron facilities where PET products are produced in compliance with cGMP requirements and U.S. Pharmacopeia requirements for PET drug compounding.
Drug laws also are in effect in many of the non-U.S. markets in which we conduct business. These laws range from comprehensive drug approval requirements to requests for product data or certifications. In addition, inspection of and controls over manufacturing, as well as monitoring of adverse events, are components of most of these regulatory systems. Most of our business is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the FDA continues to result in increases in the amount of testing and documentation required for approval or clearance of new drugs and devices, all of which add to the expense of product introduction. Similar trends also are evident in major non-U.S. markets, including Canada, the European Union, Australia and Japan.
17

To assess and facilitate compliance with applicable FDA, NRC and other state, federal and foreign regulatory requirements, we regularly review our quality systems to assess their effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. As part of our quality review, we perform assessments of our suppliers of the raw materials that are incorporated into products and conduct quality management reviews designed to inform management of key issues that may affect the quality of our products. From time to time, we may determine that products we manufactured or marketed do not meet our specifications, published standards, such as those issued by the International Standards Organization, or regulatory requirements. When a quality or regulatory issue is identified, we investigate the issue and take appropriate corrective action, such as withdrawal of the product from the market, correction of the product at the customer location, notice to the customer of revised labeling and other actions.
Hatch-Waxman Act
The Hatch-Waxman Act added two pathways for FDA drug approval. First, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits the FDA to approve ANDAs for generic versions of drugs if the ANDA applicant demonstrates, among other things, that its product is bioequivalent to the innovator product and provides relevant chemistry, manufacturing and product data. See “Item 1. Business - Patents.” Second, the Hatch-Waxman Act created what is known as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which requires the same information as a full NDA (known as a Section 505(b)(1) NDA), including full reports of clinical and preclinical studies but allows some of the information from the reports required for marketing approval to come from studies which the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA permits a manufacturer to obtain marketing approval for a drug without needing to conduct or obtain a right of reference for all of the required studies. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides for: (1) restoration of a portion of a product’s patent term that was lost during clinical development and application review by the FDA; and (2) statutory protection, known as exclusivity, against the FDA’s acceptance or approval of certain competitor applications.
Patent term extension can compensate for time lost during product development and the regulatory review process by returning up to five years of patent life for a patent that covers a new product or its use. This period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Patent term extensions, however, are subject to a maximum extension of five years, and the patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years. The application for patent term extension is subject to approval by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in conjunction with the FDA.
The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides for a period of statutory protection for new drugs that receive NDA approval from the FDA. If the FDA approves a Section 505(b)(1) NDA for a new drug that is a new chemical entity, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, then the Hatch-Waxman Act prohibits the submission or approval of an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for a period of five years from the date of approval of the NDA, except that the FDA may accept an application for review after four years under certain circumstances. The Hatch-Waxman Act will not prevent the filing or approval of a full NDA, as opposed to an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA, for any drug, but the competitor would be required to conduct its own clinical trials, and any use of the drug for which marketing approval is sought could not violate another NDA holder’s patent claims. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides for a three-year period of exclusivity for an NDA for a new drug containing an active moiety that was previously approved by the FDA, but also includes new clinical data (other than bioavailability and bioequivalence studies) to support an innovation over the previously approved drug and those studies were conducted or sponsored by the applicant and were essential to approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period does not prohibit the FDA from accepting an application from a third party for a drug with that same innovation, but it does prohibit the FDA from approving that application for the three-year period. The three-year exclusivity does not prohibit the FDA, with limited exceptions, from approving generic drugs containing the same active ingredient but without the new innovation.
Healthcare Reform and Other Laws Affecting Payment
We operate in a highly-regulated industry. The U.S. and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation that may affect the availability and cost of healthcare. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Healthcare Reform Act, substantially changes the way in which healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and has a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. The Healthcare Reform Act contains a number of provisions that affect coverage, reimbursement and/or delivery of drug products and the medical imaging procedures in which our drug products are used. Key provisions that currently affect our business include the following:

• | increasing the presumed utilization rate for imaging equipment costing $1 million or more in the physician office and free-standing imaging facility setting which reduces the Medicare per procedure medical imaging reimbursement; which rate was further increased by subsequent legislation effective January 1, 2014;


• | increasing drug rebates paid to state Medicaid programs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for brand name prescription drugs and extending those rebates to Medicaid managed care organizations;


• | imposing a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell brand name prescription drugs to specified federal government programs;

18


• | imposing an excise tax on the sale of taxable medical devices, to be paid by the entity that manufactures or imports the device: (which tax applied to applicable sales made from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015, but is currently suspended for 2016 through 2019); and


• | amending the federal self-referral laws to require referring physicians ordering certain diagnostic imaging services to inform patients under certain circumstances that the patients may obtain the services from other local and unaffiliated suppliers (which may affect the setting in which a patient obtains services).

The Healthcare Reform Act also amended the federal self-referral laws, requiring referring physicians to inform patients under certain circumstances that the patients may obtain services, including MRI, computed tomography (“CT”), PET and certain other diagnostic imaging services, from a provider other than that physician, another physician in his or her group practice, or another individual under direct supervision of the physician or another physician in the group practice. The referring physician must provide each patient with a written list of other suppliers who furnish those services in the area in which the patient resides. These new requirements could have the effect of shifting where certain diagnostic medical imaging procedures are performed.
The Healthcare Reform Act has been subject to political and judicial challenges. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that effectively eliminates the “individual mandate” to maintain health insurance coverage by eliminating the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. In a May 2018 report, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that, compared to 2018, the number of uninsured will increase by 3 million in 2019 and 6 million in 2028, in part due to the elimination of the “individual mandate”. In December 2018, a federal district court judge, in a challenge brought by a number of state attorneys general, found the Healthcare Reform Act unconstitutional in its entirety because once Congress repealed the “individual mandate” provision, there was no longer a basis to rely on Congressional taxing authority to support enactment of the law. Pending appeals, which could take some time, the Healthcare Reform Act is still operational in all respects.
Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. For example, in May 2018, President Trump and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services released a “blueprint” to lower prescription drug prices and out-of-pocket costs. Certain proposals in the blueprint, and related drug pricing measures proposed since the blueprint, could cause significant operational and reimbursement changes for the pharmaceutical industry. As another example, in October 2018, CMS solicited public comments on potential changes to payment for certain Medicare Part B drugs, including reducing the Medicare payment amount for selected Medicare Part B drugs to more closely align with international drug prices. Efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products could limit our flexibility in establishing prices for our products or otherwise adversely affect our business if implemented. Changes could occur at the federal level or state level and may be adopted by statute, rule, or sub-regulatory policies. Recent state legislative efforts seek to address drug costs and generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices. Some of those efforts have been subject to legal challenge.
General legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our products or services provided with our products. The Budget Control Act, as amended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare (but not Medicaid) payments to providers beginning in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry, and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”). Violations of international fraud and abuse laws could result in similar penalties, including exclusion from participation in health programs outside the U.S. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed.
19

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute generally prohibits, among other things, a pharmaceutical manufacturer from directly or indirectly soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration in cash or in kind where one purpose is either to induce the referral of an individual for, or the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is payable by a federal health care program, including Medicare or Medicaid. The Healthcare Reform Act clarifies the intent requirements of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, providing that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or a specific intent to violate the statute. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal fines and penalties of up to $100,000 per violation and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. In addition, the Healthcare Reform Act revised the FCA to provide that a claim arising from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. The majority of states also have anti-kickback, false claims, and similar fraud and abuse laws and although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad, and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under the anti-kickback statutes or similar laws.
Federal and state false claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willfully, among other activities, presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for drugs or services that are false or fraudulent (which may include claims for services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary services). As discussed, a claim arising from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. False or fraudulent claims for purposes of the FCA carry fines and civil penalties for violations ranging from $11,181 to $22,363 for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government and, most critically, may provide the basis for exclusion from federally funded healthcare programs. There is also a criminal FCA statute by which individuals or entities that submit false claims can face criminal penalties. In addition, under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General has the authority to exclude from participation in federal health care programs or to impose civil penalties against any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, certain false or otherwise improper claims. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws.
Laws and regulations have also been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers; require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government; and/or require disclosure to the government and/or public of financial interactions (so-called “sunshine laws”). The Healthcare Reform Act requires manufacturers to submit information to the FDA on the identity and quantity of drug samples requested and distributed by a manufacturer during each year. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations.
Other Healthcare Laws
Our operations may be affected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations (“HITECH”) which impose obligations on certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) and certain of their “business associate” contractors with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information. Although we believe that we are neither a “covered entity” nor a “business associate” under the legislation, a business associate relationship may be imputed from facts and circumstances even in the absence of an actual business associate agreement. In addition, HIPAA and HITECH may affect our interactions with customers who are covered entities or their business associates.
Antitrust and Competition Laws
The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit specific types of anti-competitive conduct, including price fixing, wage fixing, concerted refusals to deal, price discrimination and tying arrangements, as well as monopolization and acquisitions of competitors that have, or may have, a substantial adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. We believe we are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but courts or regulatory authorities may reach a determination in the future that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we are subject to similar antitrust and anti-competition laws in foreign countries. We believe we are in compliance with such laws, however, any violation could create a substantial liability for us and also cause a loss of reputation in both foreign and domestic markets. 
20

Laws Relating to Foreign Trade
We are subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern our international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA’s definition of a foreign government official. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.
Those laws also include the U.K. Bribery Act (“Bribery Act”) which proscribes giving and receiving bribes in the public and private sectors, bribing a foreign public official, and failing to have adequate procedures to prevent employees and other agents from giving bribes. U.S. companies that conduct business in the United Kingdom generally will be subject to the Bribery Act. Penalties under the Bribery Act include potentially unlimited fines for companies and criminal sanctions for corporate officers under certain circumstances.
Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. Our operations reach many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents.
We are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods, currency, products, materials, services and technology to, and certain operations in, various countries or with certain persons. Our ability to transfer people and products among certain countries may be subjected to these laws and regulations.
Health and Safety Laws
We are also subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations, both in the U.S. and abroad, relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use, transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, human health and safety in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our operations, like those of other medical product companies, involve the transport, use, handling, storage, exposure to and disposal of materials and wastes regulated under environmental laws, including hazardous and radioactive materials and wastes. If we violate these laws and regulations, we could be fined, criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We believe that our operations currently comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—We use hazardous materials in our business and must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive.”
Certain environmental laws and regulations assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous materials or wastes at those formerly owned or operated properties or at third party properties at which they have disposed of hazardous materials or wastes. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury, property damage or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous materials or wastes. We currently are not party to any claims or any obligations to investigate or remediate any material contamination at any of our facilities.
We are required to maintain a number of environmental permits and nuclear licenses for our North Billerica, Massachusetts facility, which is our primary manufacturing, packaging and distribution facility. In particular, we must maintain a nuclear byproducts materials license issued by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This license requires that we provide financial assurance demonstrating our ability to cover the cost of decommissioning and decontaminating (“D&D”) the Billerica site at the end of its use as a nuclear facility. In addition, we have a radioactive production facility in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where we must also maintain a number of environmental permits and nuclear licenses. As of December 31, 2018, we currently estimate the D&D cost to be approximately $26.9 million. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have a liability recorded associated with the fair value of the asset retirement obligations of $11.6 million and $10.4 million, respectively. We currently provide this financial assurance in the form of surety bonds. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of wastes generated by our operations. Prior to disposal, we store any low level radioactive waste at our facilities until the materials are below regulatory limits, as allowed by our licenses and permits.
21

Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have become more stringent over time. While we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with these laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection, health and safety laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Further, we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. While it is not feasible to predict the future costs of ongoing environmental compliance, it is possible that there will be a need for future provisions for environmental costs that, in management’s opinion, are not likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, but could be material to the results of operations in any one accounting period.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 488 employees, of which 443 were located in the U.S. and 45 were located internationally. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
Corporate History
Founded in 1956 as New England Nuclear Corporation, our medical imaging diagnostic business was purchased by E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (“DuPont”) in 1981. Bristol Myers Squibb (“BMS”) subsequently acquired our diagnostic medical imaging business as part of its acquisition of DuPont Pharmaceuticals in 2001. In January 2008, Avista Capital Partners, L.P., Avista Capital Partners (Offshore), L.P. and ACP-Lantern Co-Invest, LLC (collectively “Avista”) formed Lantheus Holdings and acquired our medical imaging business from BMS. On June 30, 2015, we completed an initial public offering (“IPO”) of our common stock. Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “LNTH”.
