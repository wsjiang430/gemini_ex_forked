Our Industry
We compete in the highly fragmented market of contract manufacturers, the majority of which are small local players that are limited in scale, capabilities and technology. Many of these local manufacturers have single or limited production capabilities and provide niche components in specific geographic markets. Accordingly, there are a limited number of competitors in the value-added manufacturing market in which we operate with the capacity and expertise to deliver the complete product lifecycle of solutions we offer. For example, our diverse manufacturing capabilities across product lines have contributed to us being selected the Largest Fabricator by The Fabricator magazine’s “FAB 40” listing in the desirable U.S. markets for the past twelve years in a row (2011 – 2022). While we compete with certain manufacturers across selected product lines, we believe that no single manufacturer directly competes with us across our full offering and end market applications.
Our end market diversification coupled with our extensive product breadth allows us to maintain financial stability as individual end markets fluctuate. The primary end markets we serve include heavy- and medium-duty commercial vehicles, construction & access equipment, powersports, agriculture and military, among others. As markets strengthen or weaken, our output is redirected and realigned to support ongoing change. Further, as these fluctuations affect the market, we are favorably positioned to benefit from the broader trend of our OEM customers consolidating to fewer and more sophisticated suppliers in order to improve quality and delivery while lowering the total cost of doing business. This consolidation trend will allow us to grow and protects our cash flow as markets change and shift.
We have also experienced, and benefitted from, OEM trends seeking to improve their strategy execution and simplify their business through outsourcing and reshoring. Based on our history, OEMs pursue a strategy that focuses on core component market differentiation, such as structural frames and complete powertrain assemblies, and prefer to outsource the remaining product components to third parties rather than manufacturing them in-house. This is done in order to maintain their strategic focus, drive cost savings and reduce their own investment in manufacturing, thereby allowing them to focus on the most important aspects of their value creation process, namely product design and development, final product assembly and testing, branding, sales, marketing and distribution. While each specific OEM differs in its strategy, we see these trends continuing as customers deal with workforce and supply chain constraints and look for optimum return on investments while improving cash flow. Moreover, our OEM customers focus on the production of the core components of their products, which leads them to rely on outsourced providers like us for the remaining components of their finished product needs. OEMs are also continuing to bring production back to the US and simplifying their supply chain processes. We believe we will benefit from this continued shift in our customers’ focus and ongoing desire for OEMs to improve efficiencies, reduce costs and simplify supply chains. Our established and embedded relationships, breadth of capabilities and scalability will allow us to simplify the supply chain process for our customers by acting as a single point of contact in the supply chain. In addition, we believe OEMs are increasingly favoring platforms supported by larger, more sophisticated and financially stable suppliers with the ability to serve large national and international operations all while maintaining a local touch. Our extensive manufacturing footprint, competitive cost structure and integrated design, engineering, production planning and quality program management capabilities position us favorably to take advantage of these opportunities and trends.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that customers turn to us for their manufacturing needs because we are the ultimate “ReSource”. ReSource is a dual-purpose acronym we use to describe the breadth of our capabilities and our goal to provide a complete product lifecycle solution allowing customers to re-source all of their fabrication needs through us.

Technology-Enabled Infrastructure. We continue to invest in a technology-enabled asset base that provides significant flexible and re-deployable capacity to support our planned growth, increases profitability, efficiency, quality and employee safety, reduces spend on energy and drives a long-term cost advantage over our competitors. We have leveraged our purchasing power to make significant investments in operational infrastructure throughout our history, in items such as flexible and re-deployable automation and capacity improvements to enhance throughput, quality and consistency. For example, we were one of the first in our industry to adopt fiber lasers and have continued to invest in this capability. Throughout the past couple of years, we have implemented 10,000- and 12,000-watt fiber lasers with an automation tower, which are on average three times faster, provide a cleaner, more precise cut and use one-third the power of traditional CO2 lasers, with a payback period of less than two years. Additionally, the implementation of robotic brakes has improved quality through a continued shift towards precision automation. By reducing setup procedures, manual employee lifting requirements and downtime while offering additional capacity, the implementation of robotic brakes has resulted in a payback period of approximately two years. These two examples of investments in technology-enabled infrastructure allow us to reallocate our workforce, as employees can be retrained and redeployed into more technically skilled positions. In today’s ever-changing labor market, the ability to redeploy labor to increase flexibility and capacity for our customers is of the utmost importance and interest. Our investments in continuous improvement and automation have driven operational efficiencies and improved metric tracking allowing our management team to more effectively run the business and improve the value we provide to our customers. We have, from time-to-time, made strategic, customer-driven investments that directly support new product and market expansion which result in further competitive advantages and higher switching costs for our customers.
Cost Structure and Operational Excellence. We have reduced our exposure to commodity price risk by structuring our customer contracts to pass through changes in commodity prices. As such, we have been able to effectively limit any potential impact from tariffs and commodity price volatility to our margins. Our scale and profitability have also allowed us the flexibility to implement continuous improvement initiatives in driving efficiencies, such as automation and additional capacity, which will result in long-term efficiency and margin improvements, and expanded capabilities.
Our Strategy
During 2022, we announced the implementation of a value-creation framework that is intended to maximize stakeholder value through operational and commercial excellence, organic and inorganic growth, and the continued cultivation of our high-performance employee-driven culture.
Lean-Focused Process Initiative. The Company has consistently deployed lean tools within our operations for many years, however, to significantly accelerate efforts and drive exponential improvement across all of the Company’s processes, we have implemented our MEC Business Excellence (MBX) initiative. Based upon lean manufacturing principles, MBX will continuously drive operational and commercial excellence, cost reductions and provide a platform to standardize processes and systems across all facets of the organization. As part of MBX, we have established clear short- and long-term objectives, with the goal of outlining and adapting priorities and targets to improve operational and financial goals while creating a culture with a keen focus on continuous lean improvements in order to maintain a differentiated and defendable market-leading position. The MBX initiative is expected to drive a reduction of costs and increase operating efficiencies, which will inherently accelerate immediate and long-term productivity and margin improvements.
Achieve Sales Growth Through Organic Expansion. We believe there is ample opportunity to achieve deeper penetration of existing customers and to win new customers with our strong value-added manufacturing solutions supporting the complete product lifecycle. Through leveraging our core product capabilities, we expect to expand into new markets, grow into adjacent and complementary product platforms and establish growth on new product introductions. Secular reshoring and outsourcing trends provide us with an opportunity to expand our relationships with current clients and attract new clients looking to fortify their supply chains. We are actively pursuing strategies to expand our wallet share with our customers by capturing a wider variety of products and platforms through solidifying our relationships with current customers. These opportunities are enhanced through cross selling between the Company’s capabilities and customer base. Our expertise allows us to produce higher quality components at cost-effective rates while our volume, equipment and know-how establish competitive advantages. Through these organic growth opportunities, we are focused on deepening and defending existing market share, while diversifying our customer and end market exposure.

Our strategy is to continue to identify, and opportunistically execute on, accretive acquisitions that will allow our Company to achieve further growth, maximize return on capital and diversify our end market mix. With the secular trend of growth in electrification, we are evaluating acquisition opportunities that would allow us to expand our capabilities into the light-weighting of materials, such as aluminum, plastics, and composites, providing diversification into new markets like electric vehicles and renewables along with capturing new opportunities with current customers. We also see potential acquisition opportunities expanding our design, prototyping and after-market services to better support customer requirements.
Maintain Alignment with Employee Base and Employee-Driven Results. Our rich history of employee ownership has cultivated a strategic management-employee alignment and results-driven organization with each employee contributing to a common goal. Our employees maintain an ownership stake since our IPO, which we believe benefits the entire organization as our strategic alignment remains in place and continues to generate employee-driven results. As we continue to invest in our business and increasingly implement a more technology-enabled infrastructure, we will strive to redeploy our employees in other, higher-skilled areas of our business and invest in training where needed. Our employees are the foundation of our company; with experience across a diverse range of markets and capabilities, they drive innovation, believe in our process and the outcomes of their work and our success. Our investment in new technology attracts technically savvy employees to replace retiring traditionally skilled employees. One of our key strategic priorities is to increase investment in our workforce and to improve employee retention through performance-based incentives, talent development and succession planning. We and our employees are also highly involved in, and actively support, the communities in which our facilities are located; our 2,300 employees take satisfaction in creating value and support for both our customers and communities every day.

Our Markets
Our primary end markets include (but are not limited to) the heavy- and medium-duty commercial vehicles, construction & access equipment, powersports, agriculture and military markets. While our individual end markets may be exposed to cyclical variations, the diversified nature of our end markets affords us the ability to shift production with demand as certain end markets trend lower and others trend higher. In our experience, our diversification has muted the impact of downturns on our business that have affected us in the past. For example, we experienced net sales growth during the 2008 and 2009 recessions due to strong orders, particularly from our customers focused on the military end market. Moreover, as our heavy- and medium-duty commercial vehicles, construction & access equipment, powersports, and agriculture customers’ revenues fluctuated from 2013 to 2017, with median peak-to-trough sales decline of 23%, our peak-to-trough sales declines were less than that of those respective markets at only 10%. We were able to accomplish this by reallocating our resources to serve our heavy- and medium-duty commercial vehicles and powersports customers, leading to strong double-digit growth in those end markets.

● | Heavy- and Medium-Duty Commercial Vehicles: Heavy-duty commercial vehicles include class 8 heavy trucks such as standard semi-trucks. Medium-duty commercial vehicles include classes 3-7 trucks such as box trucks;

Our Customers
We are a critical and deeply embedded supply partner with strong strategic alignment and relationships with our customers. We have developed long-standing business relationships with our OEM customers, many of which span decades. Further, we are diversified by customers and end markets with net sales attributed to our top 20 customers accounting for $483 million of 2022 net sales, and no single end market accounting for more than 39% of net sales. For the year ended December 31, 2022, John Deere, PACCAR Inc. and AB Volvo accounted for 17.2%, 16.0% and 11.9% of net sales, respectively. We have not historically experienced customer attrition given high customer switching costs resulting from our embedded relationships driven by our broad capabilities and scale.
Raw Materials and Manufactured Components
Our purchases primarily include steel and aluminum. We maintain a broad and diverse base of over 1,000 suppliers. Our established relationships provide efficient and flexible access to resources and redundancy to ensure support of our customers. We have no history of significant supply issues or outages. In 2022, no single supplier represented more than 13% of our total purchases and 98% of the raw materials we purchased were sourced from suppliers in the United States. Our suppliers are strategically located in order to maximize efficiencies and minimize shipping costs, although switching costs are minimal and we maintain a multitude of alternative suppliers that we could transfer orders to, if needed. We have structured our customer contracts to pass through commodity price changes, which has allowed us to remain mostly unaffected by raw material price volatility and tariffs. As we continue to grow, we intend to leverage our size and scale to further reduce material costs.

Sales and Marketing
We have a strong sales team comprised of approximately 50 experienced professionals responsible for managing and expanding client relationships and proactively pursuing new opportunities. Sales personnel are aligned by market segment and customer, including heavy- and medium-duty commercial vehicles, construction & access equipment, powersports, agriculture, military and other end markets, and employ a highly technical and collaborative sales process with deep knowledge of our customers and capabilities. Sales personnel have assigned support teams comprised of inside sales, commercial operations, marketing and sales administration personnel. We are consistently involved in the request for proposal processes, where our sales teams with deep process expertise collaborate with customers on optimal designs for manufacturability and manufacturing efficiency. The upfront collaboration drives formalization of product specifications, program lifecycle planning, cost estimates and risk mitigation. The sales process typically takes 3 – 18 months and ultimately ends in the implementation of product lifecycle timelines and purchase orders under long-term customer arrangements. The sales team utilizes systems infrastructure that effectively track and manage backlogs, quotes and bookings information, strategic projects and call reports, all of which are reviewed at weekly sales team meetings.
Information Systems
We utilize standardized information technology systems across all areas of quoting and estimating, enterprise resource planning, materials resource planning, capacity planning and accounting for enhanced procurement of work, project execution and financial controls. We provide information technology oversight and support from our corporate headquarters in Mayville, WI. The operational information systems we employ throughout our company are industry specific applications that in some cases have been internally or vendor modified and improved to fit our operations. Our enterprise resource planning software is integrated with our operational information systems wherever possible to deliver relevant, real-time operational data to designated personnel. Accounting and operations personnel of acquired companies are trained not only by our information technology support staff, but by long- tenured employees in our organization with extensive experience using our systems. We believe our information systems provide our people with the tools to execute their individual job function and achieve our strategic initiatives.
Our Competition
We participate in a highly fragmented market with competitors in each of the end markets we serve ranging in size from small companies focused on a single capability or end market, to large multi-disciplinary companies. While there can be instances of intense competition in specific end markets, we believe that we have been able to effectively compete, and maintain competitive advantages on the basis of our:

● | scale and product offering with the ability to cross-sell and provide our customers with a one-stop solution;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | broad manufacturing capability and flexibility to fulfill requests that require complex solutions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | customer service with our highly skilled and knowledgeable workforce able to provide consultative advice; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | regionalized geographic focus provides a defensible position from both foreign and domestic competitors as our customers continue to take a regionalized approach to production, which provides a shorter supply chain with greater flexibility.

Our Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,300 full-time employees, approximately 1,775 of whom are production employees. None of our employees are represented by a union and we are not party to any collective bargaining agreements. On average, our employees have approximately eight years of service with us.
Training and development
We maintain an experienced and skilled workforce. We have been focused on attracting and retaining high quality personnel as they represent a critical factor in our continued success.

Our talent development efforts span across all levels of the organization, including an annual performance review process allowing 

11



employees to discuss and build development plans with their leaders to develop their careers and an executive coaching program which prepares our future leaders for increased responsibilities at MEC. Despite the recent market challenges in the hiring of trade-skilled employees, our continued investment in newer technologies and capabilities has allowed us to opportunistically re-train and redeploy certain roles that were previously human capital-intensive, and re-train and repurpose employees into other areas of the company.
Compensation and benefits
We believe we maintain strong relationships with our employees and believe they are aligned with our employee-owned mindset through the Mayville Engineering Company, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the ESOP) and annual discretionary profit sharing programs. We offer our employees competitive compensation and comprehensive benefit packages, annually benchmarking them against comparable industries in the same geographic vicinity to where our facilities are located. Full-time employees are eligible to receive the following benefits: health insurance (medical, dental, vision), short-term and long-term disability, life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, flexible spending accounts, wellness program and life matters employee assistance program. Further enhancing our benefit offerings, we provide an on-site healthcare team at certain facilities to treat work and non-work related injuries and assist employees with general wellness and overall well-being.
Additionally, MEC has several initiatives centered around employee appreciation, which include: cookouts and holiday lunches, Fresh Market food program, appreciation gift cards and quarterly bonuses.
Health and safety
The safety, health and well-being of our employees is one of the Company’s top priorities. Our “Work MEC Safe” program creates a strong safety culture based on five key elements: Inspire, Lead, Analyze, Educate and Recognize. These elements lay the foundation for establishing an employee voice in daily operations, ensuring safety ownership from those in leadership roles, identifying workplace hazards through routine inspections, audits and observations, training employees to identify and mitigate risks and prevent injuries, and developing avenues to continue enhancing the importance of safety in the workplace.
Ethics
Along with our core values, we act in accordance with our Code of Conduct Policy, which creates expectations and provides guidance for all our employees to make the right decisions. Our Code of Conduct Policy covers such topics as conducting Company affairs and fair dealing, conflicts of interest, compliance and disclosures, proper use of Company assets, protecting confidential information and reporting and enforcement of Code of Conduct violations.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to manufacturing, handling and disposal of materials into the environment. We believe that our environmental control procedures are adequate.
