Item 1. Business.
General
 
RegeneRx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (“RegeneRx” or the “Company”) (OTCQB:RGRX) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of a novel therapeutic peptide, Thymosin beta 4, or Tß4, for tissue and organ protection, repair, and regeneration. We have formulated Tß4 into three distinct product candidates in clinical development:
 
•   RGN-259, a preservative-free topical eye drop for regeneration of corneal tissues damaged by injury, disease or other pathology;
 
•   RGN-352, an injectable formulation to treat cardiovascular diseases, central and peripheral nervous system diseases, and other medical indications that may be treated by systemic administration; and
 
•   RGN-137, a topical gel for dermal wounds and reduction of scar tissue.
 
We are continuing strategic partnership discussions with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies regarding the further clinical development of all of our product candidates.
 
Current Financial Status
 
On February 27, 2019, we sold a series of convertible promissory notes to management, the Company’s Board of Directors and accredited investors, including Essetifin S.p.A., our largest shareholder. The sale of the notes will result in gross proceeds to the Company of $1,300,000 over two closings. The first closing in the amount of $650,000 occurred on February 27th and the second closing, also in the amount of $650,000 will occur within three days of the Company providing notice of the enrollment of the first patent in the ARISE-3 clinical trial in DES sponsored by ReGenTree. ReGenTree has informed us that they now expect the ARISE-3 clinical trial to occur in the second quarter of 2019. Because the Company does not control the timing of the ARISE-3 clinical trial, we cannot be certain that this timing is correct or that it may not change. The notes contain a $0.12 conversion price and the purchasers also received a warrant exercisable at $0.18 to purchase additional shares of common stock equal to 75% of the number of shares into which each note is initially convertible. At present, with the receipt of the sale proceeds from the first closing, coupled with the anticipated proceeds from the second closing, we will have sufficient cash to fund planned operations through the first quarter of 2020. We continuously monitor our cash use as well as the clinical timelines.
 
We continue to evaluate options including the licensing of additional rights to commercialize our clinical products as well as raising capital through the capital markets. However, our ability to raise additional capital raises significant concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Since inception, and through December 31, 2018, we have an accumulated deficit of $106 million and we had cash and cash equivalents of $237,261 as of December 31, 2018. We anticipate incurring additional operating losses in the future as we continue to explore the potential clinical benefits of Tß4-based product candidates over multiple indications. We have entered into a series of strategic partnerships under licensing and joint venture agreements where our partners are responsible for advancing development of our product candidates by sponsoring multiple clinical trials.
 
On March 2, 2018, we entered into a warrant reprice, exercise and issuance agreement (the “Reprice Agreement”) with the holders of the warrants issued in the 2016 Offering. Under the terms of the Reprice Agreement, in consideration of the holders exercising in full all of the 2016 Offering warrants the exercise price per share of the warrants was reduced to $0.20 per share. In addition, and as further consideration, we issued to the holders of the 2016 Offering 3,860,294 new warrants with an exercise price of $0.2301 per share. We received gross proceeds of approximately $1,029,000 pursuant to the exercise and issued 5,147,059 shares of common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Reprice Agreement the exercise price of the new warrants was reduced from $0.2301 to $0.125 as a result of the March 2019 note sale.

Current Clinical Status
 
In January 2015, we entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with GtreeBNT whereby we created ReGenTree LLC, (“ReGenTree” or “Joint Venture”, jointly owned by us and GtreeBNT, which will commercialize RGN-259 for treatment of dry eye and neurotrophic keratopathy, an orphan indication in the United States. We are entitled to royalties as a percentage of net sales ranging from single digits to low-double digits based on the medical indications approved and whether the Joint Venture commercializes products directly or through a third party. RegeneRx possesses one of three board seats of ReGenTree and certain major decisions and transactions within ReGenTree, such as commercialization strategy, mergers, and acquisitions, require RegeneRx’s board designee’s consent. We currently hold a 38.5% ownership interest in ReGenTree. This ownership interest may be further reduced to as low as 25% once ReGenTree obtains FDA approval of an NDA for Dry Eye Syndrome in the U.S. In the event ReGenTree is acquired, or a change of control occurs following achievement of an NDA, RegeneRx shall be entitled to a minimum of 40% of all proceeds paid or payable and will forgo any future royalties.
 
To date ReGenTree has sponsored a Phase 2/3 clinical trial (“ARISE-1”) and Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with dry eye syndrome (“DES”) (“ARISE-2”) and in patients with neurotrophic keratopathy (“NK”) (“SEER-1”), all in the U.S. In May 2016, we reported the results of the 317-patient ARISE-1 trial and in October 2017, we reported the results of the ARISE-2 trial. The ARISE-2 study, which was sponsored by ReGenTree and managed by Ora, Inc. pursuant a recent contract between the parties, demonstrated a number of statistically significant improvements in both signs and symptoms of dry eye syndrome with 0.1% RGN-259 versus placebo, while showing excellent safety, comfort, and tolerability profiles. The ocular discomfort symptom showed a statistically significant reduction in the RGN-259-treated group at day 15 as compared to placebo (p=0.0149) in the change from baseline. For sign, RGN-259 also improved the dry eye patient’s ability to withstand an exacerbated condition in a patient subgroup with both compromised corneal fluorescein staining and Schirmer’s test at baseline. In this population, RGN-259 showed superiority over placebo in reducing corneal fluorescein staining in the change from baseline at days 15 and 29 (p=0.0207 and 0.0254, respectively). RGN-259 confirmed its global effects on dry eye syndrome and fast onset in multiple sign and symptom efficacies with no safety issues in the ARISE-1 and ARISE-2 studies as well as in the pooled data, although ARISE-2 was not successful in duplicating the results of ARISE-1 where the study population was limited and less diversified. ReGenTree is proceeding with its RGN-259 development plan as discussed with the FDA in April 2018. Most recently, ReGenTree reaffirmed that the manufacturing of the investigational product for ARISE-3 has been completed and the protocol for the study has been finalized. ReGenTree and Ora, Inc. have entered into a contract for management of ARISE-3. Ora, Inc. recently initiated the study with the first patient anticipated to be enrolled in the second quarter of 2019.
 
The NK trial (SEER-1), a smaller study in an orphan population, has enrolled seventeen patients thus far, and has several additional patients being screened, with a goal of forty-six. ReGenTree has expanded its efforts to accelerate patient enrollment by offering incentives to each study site based on numbers of enrollees as well as payments to referral sites. Earlier in 2018, ReGenTree disclosed that 7 of 17 patients enrolled SEER-1 have completely healed. To participate in the trial the patients were required to have a persistent epithelial defect (non-healing corneal wound). While these preliminary observations are encouraging, it should be noted that the patients and treating physicians remain masked while the trial is on-going, so it is not known whether the healed patients are in the RGN-259 group, placebo group, or distributed among both. As of the date of this report, we do not know when this study will be completed.
 
GtreeBNT has developed the CMC (chemistry, manufacturing and controls) dossier required for Phase 3 clinical trials and commercialization in the U.S. and in Korea. This comprehensive and critical effort ensures that final drug product manufacturing, packaging, stability, purity, reproducibility, etc., meets regulatory guidelines and product specifications. The product of this activity is the current product format being utilized in the U.S. trials being conducted by ReGenTree and will also be utilized in the planned clinical activity to be conducted by GtreeBNT under the RGN-259 license agreement for Pan Asia.
 
In February 2017, our licensee for RGN-137, GtreeBNT, received permission from the U.S. FDA to sponsor a Phase 3 clinical trial using RGN-137 to treat patients with epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a genetic disease that causes severe blistering of the skin and internal organs. In August 2017, the Company amended the License Agreement for RGN-137 held by GtreeBNT. Under the amendment the Territory was expanded to include Europe, Canada, South Korea, Australia and Japan. GtreeBNT initiated a small open trial in patients with EB in December 2018 to evaluate RGN-137 in such patients prior to sponsoring a larger Phase 3 trial.
 
Currently, we have active partnerships in four major territories: North America, Europe, China and Pan Asia. Our partners have been moving forward and making progress in each territory. In each case, the cost of development is being borne by our partners with no financial obligation for RegeneRx. We still have significant clinical assets to develop, primarily RGN-352 (injectable formulation of Tß4 for cardiac and CNS disorders) in the U.S., most of Asia, and Europe; RGN-259 in the EU. In August 2017 we amended the RGN-137 License Agreement with GtreeBNT, expanding the territory to include Europe, Canada, South Korea, Australia and Japan. Regarding RGN-259, our goal is to wait until satisfactory results are obtained from the current ophthalmic clinical program in the U.S. before moving into the EU. This should allow us to obtain a higher value for the asset at that time. However, we intend to continue to develop RGN-352, our injectable systemic product candidate for cardiac and central nervous system indications, either by obtaining grants to fund a Phase 2a clinical trial in the cardiovascular or central nervous system fields or finding a suitable partner with the resources and capabilities to develop it as we have with RGN-259.

We anticipate incurring additional operating losses in the future as we continue to explore the potential clinical benefits of Tß4-based product candidates over multiple indications. To fund further development and clinical trials we have entered into a series of strategic partnerships under licensing and joint venture agreements (see “Strategic Partnerships” below) where our partners are responsible for advancing development of our product candidates with multiple clinical trials.
 
Overview of Tß4
 
Tß4 is a synthetic copy of a naturally occurring 43-amino acid peptide that was originally isolated from bovine thymus glands. It plays a vital role in cell structure and motility and in the protection, regeneration, remodeling and healing of tissues.
 
Although it is recognized that wound healing and tissue regeneration are complex processes, most companies working to develop new drugs in this area have focused primarily on the development of growth factors and genetic therapies to stimulate healing and have, to date, failed to demonstrate dramatic improvements in the healing process. Numerous preclinical animal studies, published by independent researchers, have identified several important biological activities involving Tß4 that we believe make it potentially useful as a wound healing, repair and tissue regenerating agent. These activities include:
 

· | Progenitor (Stem) Cell Recruitment and Differentiation. Independent research published in the journal Nature in November 2006 featured the discovery that Tß4 is the key signaling molecule that recruits and triggers adult epicardial progenitor cells, or EPCs, to differentiate into coronary blood vessels. EPCs are partially differentiated stem cells that can further differentiate into specific cell types when needed. Confirmatory research published in 2009 in the Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology concluded that Tß4 is responsible for the initiation of the embryonic coronary developmental program and EPC differentiation in adult mice. These publications confirm that Tß4’s interaction with EPCs is necessary for the maintenance of a healthy adult animal heart, as well as for normal embryo and fetal heart development in mammals. In Neuroscience (2009 and 2010), and the J. Neurosurgery (2010), Tß4 was shown to similarly stimulate oligodendrogenesis, i.e., the differentiation of oligodendroctye progenitor cells into myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, whereby restoring functional recovery in animal models of multiple sclerosis, stroke, and traumatic brain injury.

· | Actin Regulation. Tß4 regulates actin, which comprises up to 10% of the protein of non-muscle cells in the body and plays a central role in cell structure and in the movement of cells. Independent research studies have indicated that Tß4 stimulates the migration of human keratinocytes, or skin cells, as well as corneal epithelial cells that protect the eye, human endothelial cells and progenitor cells of the heart and brain. Endothelial cells are the major cell type responsible for the formation of new blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. Certain of these studies conducted at the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, were the first to suggest the role of Tß4 in wound healing. The data from these studies encouraged us to license the rights to Tß4 from the NIH in 2001 and to launch an initial clinical development program that targeted the use Tß4 for chronic dermal wounds.

· | Reduction of Inflammation and scar tissue formation. Uncontrolled inflammation is the underlying basis of many pathologies and injuries. Independent research has shown that Tß4 is a potent anti-inflammatory agent in skin cells and in corneal epithelial cells in the eye. Tß4 has also been shown to decrease the levels of inflammatory mediators and to significantly reduce the influx of inflammatory cells in the reperfused heart of animals. More recent preclinical research suggests that Tß4 blocks activation of the NFκB pathway, which is involved in DNA activation of inflammatory mediators, thereby modulating inflammation in the body. This anti-inflammatory activity may explain, in part, the mechanism by which Tß4 appeared to improve functional outcome in the mouse multiple sclerosis model described above, as well as promoting repair in the heart and skin. In the skin, it has been shown to reduce scar formation by reduction of infiltration of myofibroblasts. Identifying a factor such as Tß4 that reduces scarring and blocks activation of NFκB suggests that Tß4 could have additional important therapeutic applications for inflammation-related diseases, such as cancer, osteoarthritis, rheumatic diseases, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory pulmonary disease and pancreatitis.

· | Collagen and Laminin-5 Stimulation. Tß4 has a number of additional biological activities shown to reduce inflammation, stimulate the formation of collagen, and up-regulate the expression of laminin-5, a subepithelial basement membrane protein. Both collagen and laminin-5 are central to healthy tissue, wound repair and the prevention of disease. Laminin-5 promotes cell migration and maintains cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts for intact tissues which are important for preventing fluid loss and bacterial infection.

· | Anti-Apoptosis. Tß4 has been shown to prevent apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in two animal models and in two tissue types. In the rodent model, corneal apoptosis, or loss of corneal epithelial cells leading to corneal epithelial thinning, was prevented through topical administration of Tß4 eye drops. In the heart muscle of ischemic animal models, such as in mice and pigs, cell death was prevented by either local or systemic administration of Tß4. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Tß4 has shown efficacy in heart repair and regeneration in numerous animal models. A 2004 paper in Nature showed that it could reduce the lesion size, improve cardiac function and promote survival. The 2006 Nature publication mentioned above further concluded that Tß4’s interaction with EPCs resulted in the formation of cardiomyocytes that repaired damaged myocardium, or heart tissue, in mice after an induced acute myocardial infarction, or AMI, commonly known as a heart attack. Research published in the journal Circulation showed Tß4’s cardioprotective effects in a pig ischemic-reperfusion model. This pig model is accepted as an important model upon which to base human clinical research, as pigs are larger mammals, the anatomy of the pig heart is similar to that of the human heart, and vascular response processes are completed five to six times faster in pigs than in humans, so that long-term results can be obtained in a relatively short period of time. This research also identified Tß4’s interaction with EPCs as the underlying basis of cardioprotection through the differentiation of EPCs into cardiomyocytes, yielding statistically significant cardiac functional recovery results when compared to the administration of placebo.
 
Similar research in the area of brain and central nervous system tissues also showed efficacy of repair and regeneration was published in the journal Neuroscience in 2009. This publication concluded that Tß4 triggered the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells to form myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, which led to the remyelination of axons in the brain of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, or EAE. This mouse model is an accepted small animal model for the study of multiple sclerosis. Research published in the Journal of Neurosurgery in 2010 and also in the Journal of Neurological Science in 2014 showed that Tß4 could improve functional neurological outcome in an animal stroke model. A second study was published in the Journal of Neurosurgery in 2011 demonstrating that administration of Tß4 can significantly improve histological and functional outcomes in rats with traumatic brain injury, or TBI, indicating that Tß4 has considerable therapeutic potential for patients with TBI. More recently, researchers studying Tß4 under a material transfer agreement (MTA) found that Tß4 had beneficial effects in animal models of peripheral neuropathy, one of the major complications of diabetes. This research was published in the Journal of Neurobiology of Disease in December 2012 and appears to corroborate previous findings using Tß4 for repair of central nervous system disorders. A paper in Neuropharmacology in 2014 found many benefits of Tß4 administration in a rat model of spinal cord injury, including decreased lesion size at 7 days, increased neural and oligodendrocyte survival, increase levels of myelin basic protein (a marker of mature oligodendrocytes), decreased ED1 (a marker of activated microglia/macrophages), and decreased proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, Tß4 has efficacy for repair and regeneration in several nervous system injury models including MS, TBI, stroke, peripheral neuropathy, and spinal cord injury and there will likely be additional applications in this area. We believe that these various biological activities work in concert to play a vital role in the healing and repair of injured or damaged tissue and suggest that Tß4 is an essential component of the tissue protection and regeneration process that may lead to many potential medical applications. All of our product candidates utilize Tß4 as the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), which is manufactured by solid-phase peptide synthesis and is an exact copy of the naturally occurring peptide. We have created three distinct formulations for various routes of administration and medical indications.
 
Our Product Candidates 
 
RGN-259
 
RGN-259 is our proprietary preservative-free eye drop formulation of Thymosin beta 4. In September 2011, we completed a Phase 2a exploratory clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of RGN-259 in 72 patients with moderate dry eye syndrome. In November 2011, we reported preliminary safety and efficacy results from the trial. RGN-259 was deemed safe and well-tolerated, with no observed drug-related adverse events.
 
In June 2012, we reported preliminary results from a double-masked, vehicle-controlled, physician-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating RGN-259 for the treatment of nine patients (18 eyes) with severe dry eye. RGN-259 was observed to be safe and well-tolerated and met key efficacy objectives with statistically significant sign and symptom improvements, compared to vehicle control, at various time intervals, including 28 days post-treatment.
 
Consistent with the reduction of ocular discomfort and fluorescein staining at the 28-day follow-up visit, other improvements seen in the RGN-259-treated patients included tear film breakup time and increased tear volume production. Likewise, these improvements were seen at other time points in the study. These results were published in Cornea in 2015.

In September 2015, ReGenTree began the Phase 2/3 ARISE-1 clinical trial in patients with dry eye syndrome (and the Phase 3 SEER-1 clinical trial in patients with neurotrophic keratopathy (“NK”), both in the U.S. In May 2016, we reported the results of the 317-patient ARISE-1 dry eye trial. In the trial, RGN-259 demonstrated statistically significant improvements in both signs and symptoms of dry eye with 0.05% and 0.1% RGN-259 compared to placebo in a dose dependent manner during a 28-day dosing period. While the primary outcome measures were not met, several key related pre-specified endpoints and subgroups of patients with more severe dry eye showed statistically significant treatment effects. These results confirmed the findings from the previous Phase 2 trial providing clear direction for the clinical regulatory pathway and remaining registration trials for RGN-259. Shortly following the ARISE-1 trial, the FDA approved ReGenTree’s Phase 3 ARISE-2 dry eye protocol and we initiated the ARISE-2 trial that enrolled approximately 600 patients.
 
The ARISE-2 study, which was sponsored by ReGenTree and managed by Ora, Inc., demonstrated a number of statistically significant improvements in both signs and symptoms of dry eye syndrome with 0.1% RGN-259 versus placebo, while showing excellent safety, comfort, and tolerability profiles. The ocular discomfort symptom showed a statistically significant reduction in the RGN-259-treated group at day 15 as compared to placebo (p=0.0149) in the change from baseline. For sign, RGN-259 also improved the dry eye patient’s ability to withstand an exacerbated condition in a patient subgroup with both compromised corneal fluorescein staining and Schirmer’s test at baseline. In this population, RGN-259 showed superiority over placebo in reducing corneal fluorescein staining in the change from baseline at days 15 and 29 (p=0.0207 and 0.0254, respectively). RGN-259 confirmed its global effects on dry eye syndrome and fast onset in multiple sign and symptom efficacies with no safety issues in the ARISE-1 and ARISE-2 studies as well as in the pooled data, although ARISE-2 was not successful in duplicating the results of ARISE-1 where the study population was limited and less diversified.
 
In February 2019 ReGenTree initiated a 700-patient ARISE-3 trial in patients with dry eye syndrome to confirm the results observed in ARISE-2. We anticipate the first patient will be enrolled in the second quarter of 2019.
 
Strategic Partnerships
 
Lee’s Pharmaceuticals. We are a party to a license agreement with Lee’s Pharmaceutical for the license of Thymosin Beta 4 in any pharmaceutical form, including our RGN-259, RGN-352 and RGN-137 product candidates, in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. In February 2019, the License Agreement was assigned by Lee’s to their affiliate, Zhaoke Ophthalmology Pharmaceutical Limited. Lee’s previously filed an IND with the Chinese FDA to conduct a Phase 2, randomized, double-masked, dose-response clinical trial with RGN-259 in China for dry-eye syndrome. Lee's subsequently informed us that it received notice from China's FDA declining its IND application for a Phase 2b dry eye clinical trial because the API was manufactured outside of China. The API was manufactured in the U.S. and provided to Lee's by RegeneRx pursuant to a license agreement to develop RGN-259 ophthalmic eye drops in the licensed territory. However, in mid-2016, we were informed by Lee’s that the CFDA modified its manufacturing regulations and will now allow Chinese companies to utilize API manufactured outside of China for Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. We have not yet been informed of a projected starting date for Phase 2 trials.
 
GtreeBNT. We are a party to a license agreement with GtreeBNT for the license of RGN-259 related to certain development and commercialization rights for RGN-259, in Asia (excluding China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan). Separately, we licensed GtreeBNT the rights to RGN-137 which was recently amended as discussed above. GtreeBNT is currently our second largest stockholder. GtreeBNT filed an IND with the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety to conduct a Phase 2/3 study with RGN-259 in patients with dry eye syndrome and in July 2015 received approval to conduct the trial. In late 2016 GtreeBNT informed us that it believes marketing approval in the U.S. will allow expedited marketing in Korea, possibly without the need for a clinical trial. At this point, we are still awaiting marketing approval in the U.S.
 
U.S. Joint Venture (ReGenTree, LLC). 
 
We are a party to a Joint Venture Agreement with GtreeBNT and a License Agreement with ReGenTree for the commercialization of RGN-259 for treatment of dry eye and neurotrophic keratopathy in the United States, as well as any other relevant ophthalmic indications.
 
In September 2015, ReGenTree began the Phase 2/3 ARISE-1 clinical trial in patients with dry eye syndrome (and the Phase 3 SEER-1 clinical trial in patients with neurotrophic keratopathy (“NK”), both in the U.S. In May 2016, we reported the results of the 317-patient ARISE-1 dry eye trial.

Most recently, ReGenTree reaffirmed that the manufacturing of the investigational product for ARISE-3 has been completed and the protocol for the study has been finalized. Ora, Inc. recently initiated the study with the first patient anticipated to be enrolled in the second quarter of 2019.
 
RGN-352 
 
During 2009, we completed a Phase 1a and Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the intravenous administration of RGN-352 in 60 healthy subjects (40 in each group, 20 of whom participated in both Phases). Based on the results of these Phase 1 trials and extensive preclinical efficacy data published in peer-reviewed journals, in the second half of 2010, we began start-up activities for a Phase 2 study to evaluate RGN-352 (Tß4 Injectable Solution) in patients who had suffered an AMI. We had planned to begin enrolling patients in this clinical trial in the second quarter of 2011. However, in March 2011, we were notified by the FDA that the trial was placed on clinical hold as a result of our contract manufacturer’s alleged failure to comply with the current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations. The manufacturer has since closed its manufacturing facility and filed for bankruptcy protection. The FDA prohibited us from using any of the active drug or placebo formulated by this manufacturer in human trials; consequently, we must have study drug (RGN-352 and RGN-352 placebo) manufactured by a new cGMP-compliant manufacturer in the event we seek to move forward with this trial. While we have identified a qualified manufacturer for RGN-352, we elected to postpone activities on this trial until the requisite funding or a partner is secured.
 
In addition to the potential application of RGN-352 for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, preclinical research published in the scientific journals Neuroscience and the Journal of Neurosurgery, among others, indicates that RGN-352 may also prove useful for patients with multiple sclerosis, or MS, as well as patients suffering a stroke, traumatic brain injury, peripheral neuropathy, or spinal cord injury. In these preclinical studies, the administration of Tß4 resulted in regeneration of neuronal tissue by promoting remyelination of axons and stimulating oligodendrogenesis, resulting in improvement of neurological functional activity. In 2012, researchers studying Tß4 under a material transfer agreement (MTA) found that Tß4 had beneficial effects in animal models of peripheral neuropathy, one of the major complications of diabetes. This research was published in the journal of Neurobiology of Disease in 2012 and appears to corroborate previous findings using Tß4 for repair of central nervous system disorders. We are discussing possible partnership opportunities with companies interested in developing RGN-352 for cardiac and central nervous system indications and are working with an Asian-based medical center seeking grant funding for cardiovascular studies.
 
Based on our Phase 1 data and the preclinical research discussed above, we are evaluating various opportunities for government funding for a Phase 2a clinical trial to show proof-of-concept in each case while also talking with prospective strategic partners with the interest, capabilities and resources to further develop product candidate in these fields.
 
RGN-137
 
Clinical Development — Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB).  Starting in 2005, we began conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of RGN-137 for the treatment of patients with EB. EB is a genetic disease of approximately 10 gene mutations that results in fragile skin and other epithelial structures (e.g., cornea and GI tract) that can blister spontaneously or separate at the slightest trauma or friction, creating a wound that at times does not heal or heals poorly. In severe cases, recurrent blistering and tissue loss may be life threatening. EB has been designated as an “orphan” indication by the FDA’s Office of Orphan Drugs. We closed the Phase 2 trial in late 2011 and we submitted the final report to the FDA in 2014. In February 2017, GtreeBNT received permission from the U.S. FDA to sponsor a Phase 3 clinical trial using RGN-137 to treat patients with EB. In December 2018, GtreeBNT initiated a small open trial in a limited number of patients with EB.
Clinical Development — Pressure Ulcers.  In late 2005, we began conducting Phase 2 clinical trial designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of RGN-137 for the treatment of patients with chronic pressure ulcers, commonly known as bedsores.

In January 2009, we reported final data from this trial. RGN-137 was well-tolerated at all three dose levels studied, with no dose-limiting adverse events, which achieved the primary objective of the study. A follow-on evaluation, reported at the 3rd International Symposium on the Thymosins in Health and Disease in March 2012, showed that for those pressure ulcer patients’ wounds that healed, RGN-137 mid dose (0.02% Tβ4 gel product) accelerated wound closure with a median time to healing of 22 days as compared to 57 days for the placebo. Although those results are clinically significant, they were not statistically significant.
 
Clinical Development — Venous Stasis Ulcers. In mid-2006 we began conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of RGN-137 for the treatment of patients with venous stasis ulcers. Venous stasis ulcers are a common type of chronic wound that develops on the ankle or lower leg in patients with chronic vascular disease. In these patients’ blood flow in the lower extremities is impaired leading to venous hypertension, edema (swelling) and mild redness and scaling of the skin that gradually progresses to ulceration. In 2009, we reported final data from that trial. Those results were both clinically and statistically significant.
Our Strategy
 
We seek to maximize the value of our product candidates by advancing their clinical development and then identifying suitable partners for further development, regulatory approval, and marketing. We intend to engage in strategic partnerships with companies with clinical development and commercialization strengths in desired pharmaceutical therapeutic fields. We are actively seeking partners with suitable infrastructure, expertise and a long-term initiative in our medical fields of interest. To that end, we have entered the licensing and joint ventures discussed above.
 
In 2004, we entered into a strategic partnership for development and marketing of RGN-137 and RGN-352 for specified fields of use in Europe and other contiguous countries with Sigma-Tau Group, which was subsequently acquired by Alfa Wassermann S.p.A., both Italian pharmaceutical companies. Pursuant to the terms of the license, we notified Alfa Wassermann that the license expired by its terms and we, therefore, reacquired rights to our Tß4-based products in the licensed territory. In August 2017, the Company amended the License Agreement for RGN-137 held by GtreeBNT. Under the amendment the Territory was expanded to include Europe, Canada, South Korea, Australia and Japan. Further, we now control the cardiovascular and neurovascular assets (RGN-352) in the EU and are able to consolidate them with similar assets in the U.S. and other territories in Asia to create a worldwide portfolio that we believe will be more attractive to multi-national pharmaceutical companies.
 
Manufacturing 
 
We use a major contract manufacturer to produce bulk Tß4, which is the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, in our product candidates by an established and proven manufacturing process known as solid-phase peptide synthesis. While we do not currently have long-term supply agreements in place, we and ReGenTree intend to establish a long-term supply arrangement with at least one manufacturer once practicable. No assurance can be given, however, that such agreements will be negotiated on favorable terms, or at all. Contractors are selected on the basis of their supply capability, ability to produce a product in accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements of the FDA and ability to meet our established specifications and quality requirements. Given our recent licensing and joint venture deals, our partner in Korea and the U.S. are working closely with our current primary contract manufacturer on the cGMP validation process and consistency runs, among other things, to prepare for the manufacture of bulk Tß4 for use in future clinical trials and commercialization of our formulated product candidates. Through ReGenTree we are also identifying and qualifying other potential API manufacturers. RegeneRx will have access to the data resulting from this endeavor should we need to use it for purposes outside the licensed territories.
 
We also use a number of outside contract manufacturers to formulate bulk Tß4 into our product candidates, RGN-137, RGN-259 and RGN-352. We use separate manufacturers for each formulation of Tß4. All of these formulations may require modifications, along with additional studies, as we advance our clinical development programs through commercialization.
 
Competition 
 
We are engaged in a business that is highly competitive, and our target medical indications are ones with significant unmet needs. Consequently, there are many enterprises, both domestic and foreign, pursuing therapies and products that could compete with ours. Most of these entities have financial and human resources that are substantially greater than ours, specifically with regard to the conduct of clinical research and development activities, clinical testing and in obtaining the regulatory approvals necessary to market pharmaceutical products. Brief descriptions of some of these competitive products follow:
 
RGN-259.  Most specialty ophthalmic companies have a number of products on the market that could compete with RGN-259. There are numerous antibiotics to treat eye infections to promote corneal wound healing and many eye lubrication products that are soothing to the eye and help eye healing, many of which are sold without prescriptions. Companies also market steroids to treat certain conditions within our area of interest. Allergan, Inc. markets Restasis™, Ophthalmic Emulsion, an FDA-approved eye drop used to treat dry eye. Restasis, and other products, have been approved for marketing in certain other countries where we have licensed RGN-259. Shire PLC is marketing its recently FDA-approved product, Xiidra. We believe RGN-259 is different from Restasis and Xiidra and any other product or product candidate available for dry eye in that it actively promotes repair using a multi-faceted approach of increasing cell migration and laminin-5 production, and decreasing inflammation and apoptosis, without any noted adverse effects.

RGN-352.  Currently, we do not believe there are any approved pharmaceutical products for regenerating cardiac tissue following a heart attack, nor for regeneration of nervous tissue or for the remyelination of axons of patients with multiple sclerosis or patients suffering from traumatic brain injury. However, many pharmaceutical companies and research organizations are developing products, pharmacologic and stem cell therapies and technologies that are intended to prevent cardiac damage, improve cardiac function, and regenerate cardiac muscle after a heart attack. There are also companies developing products that are purported to remyelinate neurons and provide functional improvement for patients suffering from multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and peripheral neuropathy. If we, or a partner, were to successfully develop RGN-352 for cardiovascular or central nervous system indications, such products would have to compete with other drugs or therapies currently being developed or marketed by large pharmaceutical companies for similar indications.
 
RGN-137.   There are numerous companies developing new pharmaceutical products for wound healing and for EB, in particular. Products and therapies such as antibiotics, honey-based ointments, silver-based compounds and low frequency cavitational ultrasound are also used to treat certain types of dermal wounds. Moreover, dermal wound healing is a large and highly fragmented marketplace that includes numerous therapeutic products and medical devices for treating acute and chronic dermal wounds. Most recently, various other companies are attempting to develop genetic therapies to try to heal or prevent serious wound disorders.
 
 Government Regulation
 
In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, or FFDCA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, labeling, storing, recordkeeping, distribution, advertising and promotion of our product candidates. Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and foreign countries will be a significant factor in the manufacturing and potential marketing of our product candidates and in our ongoing research and product development activities. Any product candidate we develop will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical studies, clinical trials and other approval procedures by the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries. The process of obtaining these approvals and subsequent compliance with appropriate federal and state statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources.
 
Preclinical studies must ordinarily be conducted to evaluate an investigational new drug’s potential safety by toxicology studies and potential efficacy by pharmacology studies. The results of these studies, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, which must be reviewed by the FDA before clinical trials can begin. Typically, clinical evaluation involves a three-stage process. Phase 1 clinical trials are conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers to determine the safety profile and the pattern of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, and to assess the drug’s effect on the patient. Phase 2, or therapeutic exploratory, trials are conducted with somewhat larger groups of patients, who are selected by relatively narrow criteria yielding a more homogenous population that is afflicted with the target disease, in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. Phase 2 trials should allow for the determination of the dose to be used in Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 3, or therapeutic confirmatory, large scale, multi-center, comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data for the statistical proof of safety and efficacy required by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. The primary objective of Phase 3 clinical trials is to show that the drug confers therapeutic benefit that outweighs any safety risks. All clinical trials must be registered with a central public database, such as www.clinicaltrials.gov, and once completed, results of the clinical trials must be entered in the database.
 
The results of these preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with detailed information on manufacturing, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for approval to commence commercial sales. The FDA’s review of an NDA requires the payment of a user fee currently in excess of $1.8 million, which may be waived for the first NDA submitted by a qualifying small business. In responding to an NDA, the FDA may refuse to file the application if the FDA determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria, request additional information or grant marketing approval. Therefore, even if we complete Phase 3 clinical trials for our product candidates and submit an NDA to the FDA, there can be no assurance that the FDA will grant marketing approval, or if granted, that it will be granted on a timely basis. If the FDA does approve a product candidate, it may require, among other things, post-marketing testing, including potentially expensive Phase 4 trials, which monitor the safety of the drug. In addition, the FDA may in some circumstances impose risk evaluation and mitigation strategies that may be difficult and expensive to administer. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.

Among the conditions for NDA approval is the requirement that the applicable clinical, pharmacovigilance, quality control and manufacturing procedures conform on an ongoing basis with current Good Clinical Practices, Good Laboratory Practices, current Good Manufacturing Practices, and computer information system validation standards. During the review of an NDA, the FDA will perform a pre-licensing inspection of select clinical sites, manufacturing facilities and the related quality control records to determine the applicant’s compliance with these requirements. To assure compliance, applicants must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of training, production and quality control. After approval of any product, manufacturers are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. If a company fails to comply with FDA regulatory requirements, FDA may pursue a wide range of remedial actions, including seizure of products, corrective actions, warning letters and fines.
 
We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for RGN-137 for the treatment of EB and RGN-259 for the treatment of neurotrophic keratopathy or NK, (now to be developed by ReGenTree). The FDA may designate a product or products as having orphan drug status to treat a disease or condition that affects less than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or, if patients of a disease number more than 200,000, the sponsor can establish that it does not realistically anticipate its product sales will be sufficient to recover its costs. If a product candidate is designated as an orphan drug, then the sponsor may receive incentives to undertake the development and marketing of the product, including grants for clinical trials, as well as a waiver of the user fees for submission of an NDA application. For example, as described above, we received a grant from the FDA for our Phase 2 clinical trial of RGN-137 to treat patients with EB.
 
Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to marketing exclusivity for a period of seven years in the United States and ten years in the EU. There may be multiple designations of orphan drug status for a given drug and for different indications. Orphan drug designation does not guarantee that a product candidate will be approved by the FDA for marketing for the designation, and even if a sponsor of a product candidate for an indication for use with an orphan drug designation is the first to obtain FDA approval of an NDA for that designation and obtains marketing exclusivity, another sponsor’s application for the same drug product may be approved by the FDA during the period of exclusivity if the FDA concludes that the competing product is clinically superior. In this instance, the orphan designation and marketing exclusivity originally granted would be lost in favor of the clinically superior product.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We hold worldwide patents and patent applications covering peptide compositions, uses and formulations related to dermal and ophthalmic indications and other organ and tissue repair activities. In 2001, we entered into a license agreement with the NIH under which we received an exclusive worldwide license from the NIH for all claims within the scope of the NIH’s patent application, and any issued patents, covering the use of Tß4 as a tissue repair and regeneration factor. In 2007, patents were issued in Europe and the United States related to the original NIH patent application. These patents expire in July 2019. Corresponding patents have also been granted in Hong Kong, Australia and China and certain other territories. The issued European patent was opposed by a third party at the European Patent Office and, in December 2009, we argued the case before the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office in Munich, Germany and prevailed with certain amendments to the claims. In exchange for the exclusive license, we agreed to make certain minimum royalty and milestone payments to the NIH.
 
We hold a U.S. patent relating to the use of Tß4 for the treatment of congestive heart failure. This patent was issued in January 2012. In 2006, we were issued a patent in China for the use of Tß4 to treat EB. We also hold two patents for the treatment of dry eye in the U.S. and a patent for certain neuro disorders, as well as peripheral neuropathy. Other patent applications for our various product candidates, if issued, will offer protection in the U.S. and certain other territories through 2033.
 
We, and our partners, have also filed additional U.S. and international patent applications covering various compositions, uses, formulations and other components of Tß4, as well as for novel peptides resulting from our research efforts, the latest of which were filed during 2015. There can be no assurance that these, or any other future patent applications under which we have rights, will result in the issuance of a patent or that any patent issued will not be subject to challenge or opposition. In the case of a claim of patent infringement by or against us, there can be no assurance that we will be able to afford the expense of any litigation that may be necessary to enforce our proprietary rights or that relevant patents will not expire prior to approval of any of our product candidates.
 
We continuously evaluate our patents and patent applications in certain territories to determine whether it is cost-effective to continue to maintain or prosecute them. In some cases, we have determined that the value or potential value of such patents and/or applications is not worth the continued effort or expense and have either ceased efforts to pursue specific patents or abandoned any that have short expiries or cover countries of minimal strategic interest to us or our partners. We will continue to evaluate our portfolio and take such actions from time to time as appropriate.
 
Material Agreements
 
National Institutes of Health
 
We are party to a license agreement with NIH under which we are obligated to pay an annual minimum royalty of $2,000. In 2013, we amended certain provisions of the exclusive license; we were permitted to credit amounts paid to prosecute or maintain the licensed patent rights during 2013 calendar year against the 2013 minimum annual royalty. Beginning in 2014, the minimum annual royalty is $2,000. Additionally, we are obligated to pay the NIH a percentage of sales of qualifying product candidates, if any. There have been no such sales to date. Through December 31, 2018, we have complied with all minimum royalty requirements, and no milestone payments have been required under the agreement. The patent is due to expire in 2019.

Lee’s Pharmaceuticals
 
On July 15, 2012, we entered into a License Agreement with Lee’s Pharmaceutical for the license of Tß4 in any pharmaceutical formulation, including our RGN-259, RGN-352 and RGN-137 product candidates, in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. The terms of the License Agreement include aggregate potential milestone payments of up to $3.6 million and royalties ranging from low double digit to high single digit royalties on commercial sales, if any. Under the License Agreement, Lee’s is responsible for all developmental costs associated with each product candidate. We provided Tß4 to Lee’s at no charge for a Phase 2 ophthalmic clinical trial and will provide Tß4 to Lee’s for all other developmental and clinical work at a price equal to our cost.
 
The Company has discussed Lee’s development plans and we have continued to provide information as requested. Lee’s previously filed an investigational new drug application IND with the Chinese FDA to conduct a Phase 2, randomized, double-masked, dose-response clinical trial with RGN-259 in China for dry-eye syndrome. Lee’s subsequently informed us that it received notice from China's FDA (CFDA) declining its investigational new drug (IND) application for a Phase 2b dry eye clinical trial because the API (active pharmaceutical ingredient or Tß4) was manufactured outside of China. The API was manufactured in the U.S. and provided to Lee's by RegeneRx pursuant to a license agreement to develop RGN-259 ophthalmic eye drops in the licensed territory. However, in mid-2016, we were informed by Lee’s that the CFDA modified its manufacturing regulations and will now allow Chinese companies to utilize API manufactured outside of China for Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. We have not yet been informed of a projected starting date for Phase 2 trials. In February 2019, the License Agreement was amended and assigned by Lee’s to their affiliate, Zhaoke Ophthalmology Pharmaceutical Limited. There are no economic changes to the License Agreement.
 
GtreeBNT
 
On March 7, 2014, we entered into license agreements with GtreeBNT Co., Ltd. The two Licensing Agreements are for the license of territorial rights to two of our Thymosin Beta 4-based products candidates, RGN-259 and RGN-137.
 
Under the License Agreement for RGN-259, our preservative-free eye drop product candidate, GtreeBNT will have the right to develop and commercialize RGN-259 in Asia (excluding China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau). The rights will be exclusive in Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Brunei, Cambodia, East Timor, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar (Burma), Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Kazakhstan, and semi-exclusive in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, collectively, the Territory (the “259 Territory”). Under the License Agreement for RGN-259 we are eligible to receive aggregate potential milestone payments of up to $3.5 million. In addition, we are eligible to receive royalties of a low double-digit percentage of any commercial sales of the licensed product sold by GtreeBNT in the 259 Territory.
 
Under the License Agreement for RGN-137, our topical dermal gel product candidate, GtreeBNT will have the exclusive right to develop and commercialize RGN-137 in the U.S. (the “137 Territory”). Under the License Agreement for RGN-137 we are eligible to receive aggregate potential milestone payments of up to $3.5 million. In addition, we are eligible to receive royalties of a low double-digit percentage of any commercial sales of our licensed product sold by GtreeBNT in the 137 Territory. Under an amendment to the License Agreement for RGN-137, for which we were compensated, the 137 Territory was expanded to include Europe, Canada, South Korea, Australia and Japan.
 
Both the License Agreement for RGN-137 and the License Agreement for RGN-259 contain diligence provisions that require the initiation of certain clinical trials within certain time periods that, if not met, would result in the loss of rights or exclusivity in certain countries. GtreeBNT will pay for all developmental costs associated with each product candidate. We retain the manufacturing and supply rights for Tß4 in the 259 Territory and 137 Territory and the parties will negotiate in good faith an exclusive supply agreement for Tß4 as soon as practicable. We will also have the right to exclusively license any improvements made by GtreeBNT to our products outside of the licensed territory on a royalty-free basis.
 
The two firms have created a joint development committee and continue to discuss and the development of the licensed products and share information relating thereto. Both companies will also share all non-clinical and clinical data and other information related to development of the licensed product candidates.

ReGenTree - U.S. Joint Venture
 
On January 28, 2015, we entered into the Joint Venture Agreement with GtreeBNT, a shareholder in the Company and licensee in certain Pan Asian countries. The Joint Venture Agreement provides for the creation of the Joint Venture, ReGenTree, LLC (“ReGenTree”), jointly owned by the Company and GtreeBNT that will commercialize RGN-259 for treatment of dry eye and neurotrophic keratopathy in the United States, as well as any other relevant ophthalmic indications.
 
GtreeBNT is solely responsible for funding all of the product development and commercialization efforts of ReGenTree. GtreeBNT made an initial contribution of $3 million in cash and received an initial equity stake of 51%. RegeneRx received and initial equity stake of 49% of ReGenTree. GtreeBNT’s equity stake may increase (and RegeneRx’s would proportionally decrease) upon ReGenTree achieving certain product development milestones (including receipt of a new drug application (“NDA”) by the U.S. FDA). GtreeBNT has subsequently funded the initial Phase 2b/3 and the ongoing Phase 3 U.S. clinical trials for dry eye syndrome and neurotrophic keratopathy, respectively.
 
Our initial ownership interest in ReGenTree was 49% and was reduced to 38.5% after filing of the final clinical study report with the FDA for the Phase 3 trial for Dry Eye Syndrome completed in 2017. Based on when, and if, ReGenTree achieves certain additional development milestones in the U.S. with RGN-259, our equity ownership may be incrementally reduced to between 38.5% and 25%, with 25% being the final equity ownership upon FDA approval of an NDA for Dry Eye Syndrome in the U.S. In addition to our equity ownership, RegeneRx retains a royalty on net sales that varies between single and low double digits, depending on whether commercial sales are made by ReGenTree or a licensee. In the event the ReGenTree entity is acquired or there is a change of control that occurs following achievement of an NDA, RegeneRx shall be entitled to a minimum of 40% of all proceeds paid or payable and will forgo any future royalties.
 
The Company is not required or otherwise obligated to provide financial support to ReGenTree.
 
ReGenTree is responsible for executing all development and commercialization activities under the License Agreement, which activities will be directed by a joint development committee comprised of representatives of the Company and GtreeBNT. The License Agreement has a term that extends to the later of the expiration of the last patent covered by the License Agreement or 25 years from the first commercial sale under the License Agreement. The License Agreement may be earlier terminated if the Joint Venture fails to meet certain commercialization milestones, or if either party breaches the License Agreement and fails to cure such breach, or as a result of government action that limits the ability of the Joint Venture to commercialize the product, as a result of a challenge to a licensed patent, following termination of the license between the Company and certain agencies of the United States federal government, or upon the bankruptcy of either party.
 
Development Agreements
 
While we are not currently directly engaged in development activities, historically we have entered into agreements with outside service providers for the manufacture and development of Tß4, the formulation of Tß4 into our product candidates, the conduct of nonclinical safety, toxicology and efficacy studies in animal models, and the management and execution of clinical trials in humans. Terms of these agreements vary in that they can last from a few months to more than a year in duration. For additional information regarding our research and development expenses over the past two years, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations” in this report.
