Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 
AMREP Corporation was organized in 1961 as an Oklahoma corporation and, through its subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in the real estate business. As of July 1, 2019, the Company1 employed 9 full time employees and 2 part time employees.
 
The Company has no foreign sales or activities outside the United States. Many of the amounts and percentages presented in this Part I have been rounded for convenience of presentation. All references in this Part I to 2019 and 2018 mean the Company’s fiscal years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, unless the context otherwise indicates.
 
Properties – New Mexico
 
The Company conducts its real estate business primarily in the City of Rio Rancho and certain adjoining areas of Sandoval County, New Mexico. References below to Rio Rancho include the City of Rio Rancho and such adjoining areas. The City of Rio Rancho is the third largest city in New Mexico with a population of approximately 96,000.
 
Rio Rancho consists of approximately 91,000 acres in Sandoval County near Albuquerque. As of July 1, 2019, the Company owned approximately 18,000 acres in Rio Rancho. The Company sells both developed and undeveloped lots to national, regional and local homebuilders, commercial and industrial property developers and others.
 
Activities conducted or arranged by the Company include land and site planning, obtaining governmental and environmental approvals (“entitlements”), installation of utilities and necessary storm drains, ensuring the availability of water service, building or improving of roads necessary for land development and constructing of community amenities. The Company develops both residential lots and sites for commercial and industrial use as demand warrants. The engineering work is performed by both the Company’s employees and outside firms, but all development work is performed by outside contractors. The Company markets land both directly and through brokers. With respect to residential development, the Company generally focuses its sales efforts on a limited number of homebuilders, with approximately 92% of 2019 land sales having been made to four homebuilders. 
 
The Company also opportunistically acquires land, focusing primarily in New Mexico, after completion of market research, soil tests, environmental studies and other engineering work, a review of zoning and other governmental requirements, discussions with homebuilders or other end-users of the property and financial analysis of the project and estimated development costs, including the need for and extent of offsite work required to obtain project entitlements.
 
In addition, the Company actively markets its commercial properties in Rio Rancho for sale or lease to tenants. The development of commercial properties for tenants will require, among other things, financing or other sources of funding, which may not be available.
 
The continuity and future growth of the Company’s real estate business, if the Company pursues such growth, will require that the Company acquire new properties in New Mexico or expand to other markets to provide sufficient assets to support a meaningful real estate business. The Company competes with other owners and developers of land, including in the Rio Rancho and Albuquerque area, that offer for sale developed and undeveloped residential lots and sites for commercial/industrial use.
 
The following land holdings in New Mexico are where the Company is currently focusing its residential land activities:
 

· | Lomas Encantadas. Lomas Encantadas is an approximately 430 acre master-planned subdivision located in the eastern section of Unit 20 in the City of Rio Rancho. As of July 1, 2019, Lomas Encantadas was planned to have 1,496 residential lots, of which 665 planned residential lots were previously sold by the Company.

The following table presents information on the developed and under development residential and commercial/industrial land holdings in New Mexico of the Company as of July 1, 2019:

Other undeveloped property in New Mexico of the Company as of July 1, 2019 included approximately 17,000 acres, of which approximately 20% was property that the Company had 90% contiguous ownership, approximately 30% was property that the Company had at least 50% but less than 90% contiguous ownership and approximately 50% was property that the Company had less than 50% contiguous ownership. High contiguous ownership areas may be suitable for special assessment districts or city redevelopment areas that may allow for future development under the auspices of local government. Low contiguous ownership areas may require the purchase of a sufficient number of adjoining lots to create tracts suitable for development or may be offered for sale individually or in small groups.
 

1 Developed lots/acreage are any tracts of land that have been entitled with infrastructure work that is substantially complete.
 
2 Acreage under development is real estate for which entitlement or infrastructure work is currently being completed. However, there is no assurance that the acreage under development will be developed because of the nature and cost of the approval and development process and market demand for a particular use. In addition, the mix of residential and commercial acreage under development may change prior to final development. The development of this acreage will require significant additional financing or other sources of funding, which may not be available.
 
3 There is no assurance that undeveloped acreage will be developed because of the nature and cost of the approval and development process and market demand for a particular use. Undeveloped acreage is real estate that can be sold “as is” (e.g., where no entitlement or infrastructure work has begun on such property).

Improvement Reimbursement Mechanisms
 
At the request of the Company, the City of Rio Rancho approved the formation of a public improvement district over a portion of the Lomas Encantadas subdivision and a portion of the Enchanted Hills/Commerce Center subdivision. The public improvement district is expected, over a period of at least thirty years commencing in fiscal year 2020, to reimburse the Company for certain on-site and off-site costs of developing the subdivisions by imposing a special levy on the real property owners within the district.
 
In addition, the Company instituted private infrastructure reimbursement covenants on a portion of the property in Hawk Site. Similar to a public improvement district, the covenants are expected, over a period of at least thirty years commencing in fiscal year 2021, to reimburse the Company for certain on-site and off-site costs of developing Hawk Site by imposing a special levy on the real property owners subject to the covenants.
 
The Company may accept discounted prepayments of amounts due under the public improvement district or the private infrastructure reimbursement covenants.

The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement occurred on April 26, 2019 (the “Closing Date”).
 
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Buyer acquired the Company’s fulfillment services business through the purchase from Seller of all of the membership interests (the “Membership Interests”) of Palm Coast Data LLC (“PCDLLC”) (which owned all of the membership interests of FulCircle Media, LLC) and Media Data Resources, LLC (PCDLLC, FulCircle Media, LLC and Media Data Resources, LLC are collectively referred to herein as the “Target Group”).

In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries (not including the Target Group) retained their obligations under the Company’s defined benefit pension plan following the Closing Date. The transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and the associated work force reduction with respect to the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries (not including the Target Group) resulted in the acceleration of the funding of approximately $5,194,000 of accrued pension-related obligations to the Company’s defined benefit pension plan pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and the regulations thereunder.  The Company notified the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and, as permitted by ERISA, made an election to satisfy this accelerated funding obligation over a period of seven years beginning in fiscal year 2021.
