Narrative Description of Business
Products manufactured and supplied, and services rendered, by the Company are divided into two reportable segments: the Environmental Solutions Group and the Safety and Security Systems Group. The individual operating businesses are organized as such because they share certain characteristics, including technology, marketing, distribution and product application, which create long-term synergies. Corporate contains those items that are not included in the Company’s reportable segments.
Financial information concerning the Company’s two reportable segments for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, is included in Note 17 – Segment Information to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and is incorporated herein by reference.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and operations of TowHaul Corporation (“TowHaul”). 
Environmental Solutions Group
The Company’s Environmental Solutions Group is a leading manufacturer and supplier of a full range of street sweepers, sewer cleaners, industrial vacuum loaders, safe-digging trucks, high-performance waterblasting equipment, road-marking and line-removal equipment, dump truck bodies, trailers and metal extraction support equipment. The Group manufactures vehicles and equipment in the U.S. and Canada that are sold under the Elgin®, Vactor®, Guzzler®, TRUVAC®, WestechTM, Jetstream®, Mark Rite Lines, Ox Bodies®, Crysteel®, J-Craft®, Duraclass®, Rugby®, Travis®, OSW, NTE, WTB, Ground Force, TowHaul®, Bucks® and Switch-N-Go® brand names. The Group’s product offerings also include certain products manufactured by other companies, such as refuse and recycling collection vehicles, camera systems, ice resurfacing equipment and snow-removal equipment. Products are sold to both municipal and industrial customers either through a dealer network or direct sales to service customers generally depending on the type and geographic location of the customer. In addition to vehicle and equipment sales, the Group also engages in the sale of parts, service and repair, equipment rentals and training as part of a comprehensive aftermarket offering to its current and potential customers through its service centers located across North America.
Under the Elgin brand name, the Company sells a leading U.S. brand of street sweepers primarily designed for large-scale cleaning of curbed streets, parking lots and other paved surfaces utilizing mechanical sweeping, vacuum and recirculating air technology. Vactor is a leading manufacturer of equipment solutions for cleaning and maintaining sewers and catch basins. Under the TRUVAC brand name, the Company manufactures a range of premium vacuum- and hydro-excavation trucks designed to satisfy the safe-digging requirements of businesses or organizations that locate and verify underground utility lines and pipes. Guzzler is a leader in industrial vacuum loaders used to manage industrial waste or recover and recycle valuable raw materials. Westech is a manufacturer of high-quality, rugged vacuum-excavation trucks. Jetstream manufactures high-pressure waterblasting equipment and accessories for commercial and industrial cleaning and maintenance operations. Mark Rite Lines Equipment Company, Inc. (“MRL”), is a U.S. manufacturer of truck-mounted and ride-on road-marking and line-removal equipment. Ground Force Manufacturing LLC (“Ground Force”) and TowHaul are leading manufacturers of specialty vehicles that support the extraction of metals. Truck Bodies & Equipment International (“TBEI”) manufactures and sells dump truck bodies and trailers under the Ox Bodies, Crysteel, J-Craft, Duraclass, Rugby, Travis, OSW, NTE and WTB brand names, as well as a range of interchangeable truck body systems and waste-hauling products under the Bucks and Switch-N-Go brand names. 
Safety and Security Systems Group
The Company’s Safety and Security Systems Group is a leading manufacturer and supplier of comprehensive systems and products that law enforcement, fire rescue, emergency medical services, campuses, military facilities and industrial sites use to protect people and property. Offerings include systems for community alerting, emergency vehicles, first responder interoperable communications and industrial communications. Specific products include public safety equipment, such as vehicle lightbars and sirens, industrial signaling equipment, public warning systems and general alarm/public address systems. Products are sold under the Federal SignalTM, Federal Signal VAMA®, and Victor® brand names. The Group operates manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Spain, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), and South Africa.
Marketing and Distribution
Depending primarily on the type and geographic location of the end-customer, the Environmental Solutions Group uses either a dealer network or direct sales to serve customers. The dealer network serves both municipal and industrial end-markets. Within municipal markets, the majority of the Company’s dealers operate exclusively in their assigned territory. In conjunction with selling vehicles to end-customers, dealer representatives demonstrate vehicle functionality and capability and provide vehicle service. In addition to selling products manufactured by the Company, certain of our businesses distribute and re-sell products manufactured by other companies. The Company believes its regional, national and global dealer networks for vehicles is a distinguishing factor from its competitors. The Company has an ownership interest in certain dealers. 
The Environmental Solutions Group’s direct sales channel concentrates primarily on the industrial, utility and construction market segments. To support current and potential customers in these market segments, the Group also engages in the sale of parts, service and repair, equipment rentals and training through its service centers located across North America.
The Safety and Security Systems Group sells to industrial customers through wholesalers and distributors who are supported by Company sales personnel or independent manufacturer representatives. Products are also sold to municipal and governmental customers through active independent distributors, as well as through original equipment manufacturers and the direct sales force. The Company sells comprehensive integrated warning and interoperable communications through a combination of the direct sales force and independent distributors. International sales are made through independent foreign distributors or on a direct basis. 
Customers and Backlog
No single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s net sales in any year within the three-year period ended December 31, 2022. 
The Company’s backlog totaled $879 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $629 million at December 31, 2021. Backlogs vary by group due to the nature of the Company’s products and the buying patterns of its customers. The Environmental Solutions Group typically experiences an average backlog of approximately three to six months of shipments. The Safety and Security Systems Group typically experiences an average backlog of approximately two months of shipments. While supply chain disruption and customer demand have contributed to longer lead times for certain businesses, production of the Company’s December 31, 2022 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2023.
Suppliers
The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials from around the world for use in the manufacture of its products, although the majority of its purchases are currently from North American sources. To minimize risks relating to availability, price and quality of key products and components, the Company is party to numerous strategic supplier arrangements. Although certain materials are obtained from either a single-source supplier or a limited number of suppliers, the Company has generally identified alternative sources to minimize the interruption of its business in the event of supply disruptions. However, the Company may incur supply disruptions and unanticipated costs in transitioning to a new supplier. 
Components critical to the production of the Company’s vehicles, such as engines, are purchased from a select number of suppliers. The Company also purchases raw and fabricated steel, as well as commercial chassis, from multiple sources. In addition, we may incorporate chassis provided directly by our customers in our production process. In those situations, the Company’s production processes rely upon the customer providing the chassis on a timely basis. Certain of the Company’s businesses also rely on the availability of inventory supplied by others to meet customer demand. 
The Company actively manages material supply sourcing and employs various methods to limit risk associated with commodity cost fluctuations and availability. During 2022, the Company’s manufacturing operations continued to be adversely affected by supply chain disruptions, which impacted the supply of raw materials and purchased components, and inflationary pressure. The Company has designed and implemented plans to partially mitigate the impact of these challenges by using alternate 
suppliers, re-engineering products, expanding its supply base globally, leveraging overall purchasing volumes to obtain favorable pricing and quantities and developing a closer working relationship with key suppliers. However, the Company can provide no assurance that those efforts will be successful. Although global supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressure have recently shown some signs of easing, the Company anticipates that component shortages, production delays and elevated material costs may persist into 2023. 
Competition
Within the Environmental Solutions Group, Elgin is recognized as a market leader among domestic sweeper competitors and differentiates itself primarily on product performance. The Vactor, TRUVAC and Guzzler brands each maintain a leading domestic position in their respective marketplaces by enhancing product performance with leading technology and application flexibility. Jetstream is a market leader in the in-plant cleaning segment of the U.S. waterblast industry, competing on product performance, rapid delivery and solutions services. Joe Johnson Equipment, Inc. with Joe Johnson Equipment (USA), Inc., (collectively, “JJE”), is a leading Canadian-based distributor of maintenance equipment for municipal and industrial markets. TBEI includes a portfolio of regional dump truck body and trailer brands with market leadership positions in distinct geographies and product categories, differentiating itself with its broad regional distribution network, focus on customer responsiveness and operational expertise. MRL is a market-leading manufacturer of road-marking and line-removal equipment. Ground Force and TowHaul are leading manufacturers of specialty vehicles that support the extraction of metals. 
Within specific product categories and domestic markets, the businesses within the Safety and Security Systems Group are among the market leaders. This Group’s international market position varies from leader to ancillary participant depending on the geographic region and product line. Generally, competition is intense within all of this Group’s product lines and purchase decisions are made based on price, features, reputation, performance and service, often within competitive bidding situations.
Patents and Trademarks
The Company owns a number of patents and possesses rights under others to which it attaches importance, but it does not believe that its business as a whole is materially dependent upon any such patents or rights. The Company also owns a number of trademarks, including those listed within the “Narrative Description of Business” section above. We believe these trademarks are important in connection with the identification of our products and associated goodwill with customers, but no material part of the Company’s business is dependent on our trademarks.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed approximately 4,100 people in its businesses located in five countries, with the Company’s U.S. hourly employees accounting for approximately 54% of its total workforce. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 10% of the Company’s U.S. hourly workers were represented by unions. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the International Association of Machinists (“IAM”) union was decertified at the Company’s Rugby, North Dakota manufacturing facility. The decertification process was initiated and completed by the employees represented by the IAM union, which included approximately 73% of the employees at that facility. The Company believes that its labor relations with its employees are good, as evidenced by the decertification in 2022. 
The Company believes that its employees are key to its ability to deliver exceptional products and services to its customers. The Company applies a holistic total rewards strategy, designed to recruit, motivate, and retain talented employees at all levels of the organization and offer competitive, market-based compensation programs and attractive benefit packages.
Human Rights
The Company is committed to respecting and upholding the internationally recognized human rights principles of the United Nations’ Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In every state and country where the Company operates, it upholds standards that meet or exceed those established by local, state, and national legal frameworks, and the Company expects its partners, suppliers, vendors, and contractors to do the same. The Company has published a human rights policy, setting forth its commitment to equality and nondiscrimination, elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor, the effective abolition of childhood labor, workers’ rights to freedom of association and unionization, and protecting employees’ ability to confidentially report policy violations.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
The Company is committed to promoting and supporting diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”). The Company believes that behaving inclusively is the right thing to do. The Company also believes that hearing different voices, and seeking different perspectives and ideas, leads to better results. The Company strives to promote diversity on its Board of Directors, senior 
management and in leadership roles throughout the Company. Currently, two of the Company’s seven directors self-identify as members of a minority group. 
In addition, two of the Company’s directors are female, placing the Company in line with the average for companies in the Russell 3000 Index. Of the companies in the Russell 3000 Index, approximately 6% have a female Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), and the Company is proud to be among that group. In addition, 60% of the Company’s current executive officers are female, including the Company’s President and CEO, Vice President and General Counsel, and Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller.
The Company’s commitment to DE&I throughout the organization is further evidenced by its policies related to various aspects of employment, including, but not limited to, recruiting, selecting, hiring, employment placement, job assignment, compensation, access to benefits, selection for training, use of facilities, and participation in Company-sponsored employee activities. During 2021, the Company’s Executive Leadership Team, comprised of business leaders from across the organization, completed a comprehensive DE&I educational awareness training led by an industry expert. In 2022, this same group completed additional training on the importance of building inclusive workplaces. Additionally, the Company piloted DE&I training at a key manufacturing location in 2022. 
Employee Recruitment, Training and Development
The Company believes that identifying and developing the next generation of business leaders is important to its long-term success, and is proud to support its employees in furthering their education with tuition reimbursement programs and training. 
The Company’s recruitment program follows a defined process to attract and hire top talent, including a college internship program designed to identify and cultivate an early-in-career pipeline of talent, and employee referral bonus programs. The Company additionally engages external professional recruiting firms to supplement its internal recruiting efforts, as needed.
The Company provides extensive training to employees within its facilities, ranging from topics such as workplace safety, anti-fraud, anti-discrimination and anti-harassment training, to advanced instruction in lean manufacturing principles and inside sales training programs. On average, the Company’s employees each receive more than 10 hours of job training per year, with some employees of certain business units each averaging nearly 80 hours of training per year. 
Through its Tuition Assistance Program, the Company also aims to assist and encourage employees to expand their knowledge, skills, and job effectiveness by continuing their education at local accredited institutions of higher learning. Certain of the Company’s businesses also partner with nearby universities, from time to time, to offer courses and programs directly related to the employee’s growth in the business.
The Company maintains a robust annual performance management process across the organization. Employees start the process by working with their supervisors to set individual performance goals. Progress against those objectives is tracked throughout the year, culminating in the year-end performance review process, which involves the completion of an employee self-assessment and a discussion between the employee and their supervisor on goal accomplishment and defined core competencies. In addition, the Company’s annual talent and succession management processes are designed to identify and develop next-level successors through a variety of assignments and experiential learning. 
The Company actively seeks opportunities for regular engagement and communication with its CEO and other senior executive leaders with its broader employee population. In addition, many of the Company’s businesses perform employee engagement surveys that provide valuable feedback to the management teams.
The Company is committed to the communities in which it operates, and to developing a strong pipeline from which it can recruit new talent. Many of the Company’s businesses support their local high schools with cooperative learning extension programs at their manufacturing plants, hosting in-person or virtual tours of our facilities, and providing scholarships and “signing-day” offers to high school seniors. The Company’s employees raise funds and donate time to a variety of community engagement initiatives and support expanded outreach to diverse communities.
The Company’s employees also donate time and expertise through volunteering and mentorship programs, and work with local colleges on training programs to teach valuable technical skills that can be applied in the workplace. Many of the Company’s businesses also recruit summer interns from regional universities, providing hands-on experience in a manufacturing setting and building a pipeline for future engineers, information technology specialists and financial analysts. These programs attempt to help the Company’s next generation, and others, understand what career paths may be available to them and to explore future job opportunities with the Company. 
Safety
The Company considers the safety of its employees a significant focus and strives to have zero workplace injuries. The Company has established an enterprise-wide Safety Council, which includes representatives from several of our manufacturing facilities. The Safety Council meets regularly to collaborate and implement safety improvement measures, including workplace 
hazard reduction programs and awards focusing on continuous improvement initiatives and the reduction of incident frequency. 
The Company continues to monitor the impact of the pandemic on its business and employees, while ensuring the ongoing support of customer sites to remain operational, and will implement or modify its policies to adapt to changing circumstances arising from the coronavirus pandemic. 
Governmental Regulation of the Environment
As part of its ongoing commitment to environmental, social and governance initiatives, the Company endeavors to establish environmentally-friendly policies and objectives, and believes that these actions are also consistent with cost-effective operating practices. With the application of these policies, the Company believes it complies with federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Capital expenditures in 2022 attributable to compliance with such laws were not material. The Company also believes that the overall impact of compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.
Seasonality
Certain of the Company’s businesses are susceptible to the influences of seasonal factors, including buying patterns, delivery patterns and productivity influences from holiday periods and weather. In general, the Company tends to have lower equipment sales in the first calendar quarter of each year compared to other quarters as a result of these factors. In addition, rental income and parts sales are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, because many of the Company’s products are used for maintenance activities in North America, where usage is typically lower during periods of harsher weather conditions.
