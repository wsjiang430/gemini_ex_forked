ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
We are a fully-integrated healthcare real estate company organized as a corporation in the State of Maryland on March 28, 2014. We own and acquire real estate properties that are leased to hospitals, doctors, healthcare systems or other healthcare service providers in our target submarkets. 
Real Estate Investments
As of December 31, 2018, we had investments of approximately $444.9 million in 103 real estate properties located in 29 states, totaling approximately 2.2 million square feet in the aggregate. The real estate properties were approximately 88.8% leased at December 31, 2018 with a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 6.8 years. The Company's real estate investments by geographic area are detailed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table details the Company's real estate investments at December 31, 2018:

(Dollars in thousands) | Number of Properties | Gross Investment
Medical office buildings | 35 | | $ | 164,133
Physician clinics | 20 | | 49,625 | 
Surgical centers and hospitals | 15 | | 75,788 | 
Specialty centers | 25 | | 71,726 | 
Behavioral facilities | 7 | | 66,551 | 
Long-term acute care hospitals | 1 | | 14,928 | 
 | 103 | | 442,751 | 
Corporate property | — | | 2,179 | 
Total real estate investments | 103 | | $ | 444,930

Our investments in healthcare real estate are considered a single reportable segment as further discussed in Note 1 of Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K setting forth the required financial information. 
Customer Concentrations
Our real estate portfolio is leased to a diverse tenant base. For the year ended December 31, 2018, none of our tenants individually accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. We have no control over the success or failure of our tenants' businesses and, at any time, any of our tenants may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition. 
Geographic Concentrations
The Company's portfolio is currently located in 29 states with approximately 42.4% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 derived from properties located in Illinois (18.9%), Ohio (13.4%), and Florida (10.1%). Such geographic concentrations could expose the Company to certain downturns in the economics of those states or other changes in the such states' respective real estate market conditions. Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in any of these areas could have an effect on our overall business results. In the event of negative economic or other changes in any of these markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and the trading price of our common shares may be adversely affected. See each of the discussions under Item 1A, "Risk Factors," under the captions "Adverse economic or other conditions in the geographic markets in which we conduct business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and have a material 
6

adverse effect on our operating results," and "A large percentage of our properties are located in Illinois, Ohio, and Florida, and changes in these markets may materially adversely affect us." 
2018 Real Estate Investments
In 2018, the Company acquired 19 properties totaling approximately 286,000 square feet for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $55.1 million. The Company’s expected returns on these investments range from approximately 9% to 11%. As part of a bankruptcy settlement involving a tenant, the Company also provided a $23.0 million loan to a newly formed company, secured by all of the assets and ownership interests in seven long-term acute care hospitals and one inpatient rehabilitation hospital. See Notes 4 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail on these investments. 
Competitive Strengths
We believe our management team's significant healthcare, real estate and public REIT management experience distinguishes us from other REITs and real estate operators, both public and private. Specifically, our Company's competitive strengths include, among others:

• | Strong, Diversified Portfolio. Our focus is on investing in properties where we can develop strategic alliances with financially sound healthcare providers that offer need-based healthcare services in our target markets. Our tenant base includes many nationally recognized healthcare providers (or their affiliates) and our property portfolio has significant diversification with respect to healthcare provider, industry segment, and facility type. 


• | Attractive and Disciplined Investment Focus. We focus on healthcare facilities in our target submarkets which are off-market or lightly marketed transactions at purchase prices generally between $5 million and $30 million. We believe there is significantly less competition from existing REITs and institutional buyers for assets in these target submarkets than for comparable urban assets, thereby increasing the potential for more attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition, we believe that healthcare-related real estate rents and valuations are less susceptible to changes in the general economy than many other types of commercial real estate due to favorable demographic trends and the need-based rise in healthcare expenditures, even during economic downturns. 


• | Extensive Relationships with Healthcare Providers, Intermediaries and Property Owners. We believe that our management team has a strong reputation among, and a deep understanding of the real estate needs of, healthcare providers in our target submarkets. In addition, we have strategic relationships which we believe gives us the ability to meet the needs of healthcare providers by structuring transactions that are mutually advantageous to sellers, our tenants and us. We believe this ability has, and will continue to, lead to strategic acquisition opportunities, which will, in turn, produce attractive risk-adjusted returns. None of our properties to date were acquired pursuant to "calls for offers" or other auction style bidding situations. We believe our relationships provide us with additional off-market or lightly marketed acquisition opportunities, thus providing us the opportunity to continue to purchase assets outside a competitive bidding process. 


• | Experienced Management Team. Each of the members of our executive management team has over 30 years of healthcare, real estate and/or public REIT management experience. Led by Timothy G. Wallace, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, W. Page Barnes, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Leigh Ann Stach, our Vice President-Financial Reporting and Chief Accounting Officer, our management team has significant experience in acquiring, owning, operating and managing healthcare facilities and providing full service real estate solutions for the healthcare industry. Prior to founding our company, Mr. Wallace was a co-founder and Executive Vice President of Healthcare Realty Trust (NYSE: HR). Between the initial public offering of HR in 1993 and his departure from HR in 2002, Mr. Wallace was integral in helping to grow HR to over $2 billion in assets. Mr. Barnes has held executive positions with acute care and behavioral hospital companies and directed healthcare lending for 

7

AmSouth Bank. Ms. Stach has experience in public healthcare REIT accounting and financial reporting.

• | Growth Oriented Capital Structure. At December 31, 2018, we had $43.0 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility and had $100.0 million outstanding on our term loans under our second amended and restated Credit Agreement (collectively, our "Credit Facility") with a 35.2% debt-to-book capitalization ratio. In the future, in addition to equity and debt issuances, we may also use OP units of our operating partnership as currency to acquire additional properties from owners seeking to defer their potential taxable gain and diversify their holdings. We believe that the borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility, combined with our ability to use OP units as acquisition currency, provides us with significant financial flexibility to make opportunistic investments and fund future growth.


• | Significant Alignment of Interests. We have structured the compensation of our board and management team to closely align their interests with the interests of our stockholders. The Company's named executive officers have elected to take 100% of their total compensation in restricted stock since the Company's initial public offering, or IPO, in May 2015, subject to an eight-year cliff-vesting period. The Company's board of directors have elected to take 88% of their total compensation in restricted stock since the Company's IPO, subject to a three-year cliff-vesting period. We believe that paying our board and management team with restricted stock that is subject to long-term cliff-vesting periods effectively aligns the interests of our board and management with those of our stockholders, creating significant incentives to maximize returns for our stockholders. In addition, concurrently with the completion of our IPO in May 2015 and our follow-on offering in 2016, Mr. Wallace purchased over $2.6 million in shares of our common stock and certain of our officers and directors purchased an aggregate of $450,000 in shares of our common stock in concurrent private placements in each case at a price per share equal to the price of the shares sold in the IPO or follow-on offering, as applicable. Further, Mr. Wallace has purchased 178,213 shares of our common stock under 10b5-1 plans that he had in place between 2016 and 2017, which we believe further aligns management's interests with our stockholders. Finally, we have adopted, and each officer and director has met, stock ownership guidelines that require our officers and directors to continuously own an amount of our common stock based on a multiple of such officer's annual base salary or such director's annual retainer, as applicable, other than one member of our board that joined the board during 2018. 

Business Objective
Our principal business objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders through a combination of (i) sustainable and increasing rental income and cash flow that generates reliable, increasing dividends and (ii) potential long-term appreciation in the value of our properties and common stock. Our primary strategies to achieve our business objective are to invest in, own and proactively manage a diversified portfolio of healthcare properties, which we believe will drive reliable, increasing rental revenue and cash flow.
Growth Strategy
We intend to continue to grow our portfolio of healthcare properties primarily through acquisitions of healthcare facilities in our target submarkets that provide stable revenue growth and predictable long-term cash flows. We generally focus on individual acquisition opportunities between $5 million and $30 million in off-market or lightly marketed transactions and do not intend to participate in competitive bidding or auctions of properties. We believe that there are abundant opportunities to acquire attractive healthcare properties in our target markets either from third-party owners of existing healthcare facilities or directly with healthcare providers through sale-leaseback transactions. We believe there is significantly less competition from existing REITs and institutional buyers for assets in these target submarkets than for comparable urban assets, thereby increasing the potential for attractive risk-adjusted returns. Furthermore, we may acquire healthcare properties on a non-cash basis in a tax efficient manner through the issuance of OP units as consideration for the transaction.
We intend for our investment portfolio to be diversified among healthcare facility type and segments such as medical office buildings, physician clinics, ambulatory surgery centers, behavioral facilities, dialysis clinics, 
8

oncology centers, acute care hospitals, assisted living facilities, post-acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and specialty hospitals, as well as being diverse both geographically and with respect to our tenant base. We seek to invest in properties where we can develop strategic alliances with financially-sound healthcare providers that offer need-based healthcare services in our target markets.
In connection with our review and consideration of healthcare real estate acquisition opportunities, we generally take into account a variety of considerations, including but not limited to:

• | whether the property will be leased to a financially-sound healthcare tenant;


• | the historical performance of the market and its future prospects;


• | property location, with an emphasis on proximity to a population base;


• | demand for healthcare related services and facilities;


• | current and future supply of competing properties;


• | occupancy and rental rates in the market;


• | population density and growth potential;


• | anticipated capital expenditures;


• | anticipated future acquisition opportunities; and


• | existing and potential competition from other healthcare real estate owners and tenants.

We currently have no intention to invest in companies that provide healthcare services structured to comply with the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, or RIDEA.

We operate so as to maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are not subject to corporate federal income tax with respect to taxable income distributed to our stockholders. We have also elected one subsidiary to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"), which is subject to federal and state income taxes. 
Tax Status

We have qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes since 2015, the year we began operations, and we expect that we will remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the year ending December 31, 2019. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our capital stock. We believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code and that our manner of operations will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the year ending December 31, 2019.

As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. Under the Code, REITs are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that they distribute on an annual basis at least 90% of their REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gains. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates, and we would be disqualified from 
9

taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT. Even if we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to state and local taxes on our income and assets and to U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. Additionally, any income earned by Community Healthcare Trust Services, Inc., our TRS, and any other TRSs that we form or acquire in the future will be fully subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income tax. See Government Regulation and Legislative Developments below for a discussion of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”) and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA"), enacted on December 22, 2017, which reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.
Government Regulation

Our healthcare tenants and their operators are subject to extensive federal, state and local government legislation and regulation. Federal laws, including but not limited to the Affordable Care Act; laws intended to combat fraud and waste such as the Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Law, False Claims Act; Medicare and Medicaid laws and regulations; and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 may limit our tenants operational flexibility and compensation arrangements. Many states have analogous laws which may be broader than their federal counterparts, including state licensure laws, privacy rules, and Medicaid requirements. Compliance with these regulatory requirements can increase operating costs and, thereby, adversely affect the financial viability of our tenants’ businesses. Our tenants’ failure to comply with these laws and regulations could adversely affect their ability to successfully operate our properties, which could negatively impact their ability to satisfy their contractual obligations to us. As a landlord, we intend for all of our business activities and operations to conform in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, including healthcare laws and regulations. Our leases require the tenants and operators to comply with all applicable laws, including healthcare laws. However, we do not have any ability to audit nor do we independently verify such information.
These laws subject tenant healthcare facilities and practices to requirements related to reimbursement, licensing and certification policies, ownership of facilities, addition or expansion of facilities and services, pricing and billing for services, compliance obligations (including those governing the security, use and disclosure of confidential patient information) and fraud and abuse laws. These laws and regulations are wide-ranging and complex, may vary or overlap from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and are subject frequently to change. Healthcare facilities may also be affected by changes in accreditation standards or in the procedures of the accrediting agencies that are recognized by governments in the certification process. In addition, expansion (including the addition of new beds or services or the acquisition of medical equipment) and occasionally the discontinuation of services of healthcare facilities may be subject to state regulatory approval through certificate of need programs. This may impact the ability of our tenants to expand their businesses. Different tenants may be more or less subject to certain types of regulation, some of which are specific to the type of facility or provider. We cannot predict the degree to which these changes, or changes to the federal healthcare programs in general, may affect the economic performance of some or all of our tenants, positively or negatively. We expect healthcare providers to continue to adjust to new operating and reimbursement challenges, as they have in the past, by increasing operating efficiency and modifying their strategies to profitably grow operations.
There are various state and federal laws that may apply to investors including U.S. federal and state anti-kickback and fee-splitting statutes, which limit physician referrals to entities in which the physician has a financial relationship. States vary in the types of entities, if any, that their laws cover. Investment interests in those facilities may, in certain instances, prohibit referrals to the entity by physician investors. Physician investors may also face disciplinary action from licensure boards for referrals to entities in which the physician has an investment interest. Some states require disclosure of the financial relationship before referral by any physician investors, while others prohibit referrals entirely. These state laws and regulations may be broader than their federal counterparts and are the subject of state enforcement. Many state laws contain exemptions for investments in publicly traded companies provided certain requirements are met. These exemption requirements may include listing on a national stock exchange or maintaining a minimum asset value. Meeting some of these requirements may be dependent on market forces or otherwise outside our control.

Changes in laws and regulations, reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory non-compliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition, which in turn may adversely impact us, as detailed below and set forth under Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” under the caption “The healthcare industry is heavily regulated and new laws or regulations, changes to existing laws or regulations, changes to reimbursement models or structure, loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure could adversely impact our company and result in the inability of our tenants to make rent payments to us.” We highlight below several of the more complex laws; however this is an overview, as the complexities of the laws impacting tenants are varied and extensive.
The Affordable Care Act has continued to change how healthcare services are covered, delivered and reimbursed. The Affordable Care Act includes payment reform provisions intended to drive Medicare towards more value-based purchasing which, in turn, increases accountability for healthcare providers for the quality and costs of the healthcare services they provide. While more individuals now carry healthcare coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act, the full effects of the changes to reimbursement models for both public and commercial coverage continue to evolve. Each kind of healthcare provider tenant has a different and complex set of laws related to reimbursement and reimbursement models, which may affect the tenant’s ability to collect revenues and meet the terms of their leases. Such varying reimbursement models and laws impact each kind of provider as well as the healthcare system as a whole. For example, for physicians, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services sets an annual Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate and updates a related physician fee schedule to control spending by Medicare on physician services. The implementation of this physician fee schedule can be suspended or adjusted by Congress, as has been done regularly in the past. In addition, for ambulatory service centers, the Affordable Care Act introduced provisions that reduce the annual inflation update for payment rates by a “productivity adjustment,” which may result in a decrease in Medicare payment rates for the same procedures in a given year compared to the prior year. Other changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act could negatively impact reimbursement for any one of the kind of provider tenants as outlined below.
The Affordable Care Act also altered reimbursement from private insurers and managed care organizations. Networks continue to readjust, and all providers must ensure adequate market share in their respective areas to remain in the network created by many of the managed care organizations. Under the Affordable Care Act prior to the Trump Administration, individuals were required to obtain coverage or pay a penalty resulting in millions of more Americans obtaining coverage, usually through the healthcare exchanges (called the Marketplace) established to provide coverage in each state. The Trump Administration and Congress removed this mandate beginning in 2019. The Administration has also loosened rules to allow greater flexibility among insurers in the benefits offered, both lowering the costs of some plans but also limiting the coverage such plans offer. It is unclear at this time if increased competition from lowcost plans will damage the Marketplace, and how these changes will affect coverage rates in any particular state or locale. While the Trump Administration had decreased its focus on repealing the Affordable Care Act, a December 2018 federal court ruled the law unconstitutional. This decision is still being appealed by several states. There is continued uncertainty with respect to the impact the Trump Administration and the federal judiciary may have on the Affordable Care Act, and it could impact coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Affordable Care Act. However, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us and/or our tenants.
Section 603 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 lowered Medicare rates, effective January 1, 2017, for services provided in off-campus, provider-based outpatient departments, to the same level of rates for physician-office settings. Section 603 does not apply to facilities that billed at the lower Medicare rates on or before November 2, 2015 (the "grandfather clause") or that had a binding written agreement in place for the construction of the off-campus site before November 2, 2015 (the "mid-build exemption"). Section 603 reflects movement by the Congress and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") toward “site-neutral reimbursement” where Medicare rates across different facility-type settings are equalized. CMS finalized rules in 2018 to implement these changes. While changes such as Section 603 are expected to lower overall Medicare spending, our medical office buildings located on hospital campuses could become more valuable as hospital tenants keep their higher Medicare rates for on-campus outpatient services. However, we cannot predict the amount of benefit from these measures or if current 
11

and future federal budget negotiations will ultimately require similar site neutral changes in Medicare reimbursement rates for services provided in other facility-type settings. 
Legislative Developments 
Each year, legislative proposals for health policy are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, and regulatory changes are enacted by government agencies. These proposals, individually or in the aggregate, could significantly change the delivery of healthcare services, either nationally or at the state level, if implemented. Examples of significant legislation currently under consideration, recently enacted or in the process of implementation, include: 

• | the Affordable Care Act and proposed amendments and any further repeal measures and related actions at the federal and state level;


• | the repeal of a portion of the Affordable Care Act (effective in 2019) for the mandate that all individual's purchase health insurance or pay a tax penalty;


• | quality control, cost containment, and payment system reforms for Medicaid, Medicare and other public funding, such as expansion of pay-for-performance criteria and value-based purchasing programs, bundled provider payments, accountable care organizations, increased patient cost-sharing, geographic payment variations, comparative effectiveness research, and lower payments for hospital readmissions;


• | implementation of health insurance exchanges and regulations governing their operation, whether run by the state or by the federal government, whereby individuals and small businesses purchase health insurance, including government-funded plans, many assisted by federal subsidies that are under ongoing legal challenges;


• | equalization of Medicare payment rates across different facility-type settings (i.e.; the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, Section 603, lowered Medicare payment rates, effective January 1, 2017, for services provided in off-campus, provider-based outpatient departments to the same level of rates for physician-office settings for those facilities not grandfathered-in under the current Medicare rates as of the law’s date of enactment, November 2, 2015);


• | the continued adoption by providers of federal standards for, and the associated audits of, the meaningful-use of electronic health records and the transition to ICD-10 coding;


• | an increased flexibility from the Trump Administration to grant Medicaid waivers, including work and job training requirements, which could decrease Medicaid coverage;


• | a continuing trend of provider consolidation and associated antitrust scrutiny; and


• | tax law changes affecting non-profit providers, including the 2017 act's effect on charitable contributions.

Environmental Matters

As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties as a result of environmental contamination or noncompliance at our properties even if we no longer own such properties. See the discussion under Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” under the caption “Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with owning and leasing our properties may affect our results of operations.”
Competition
We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of healthcare properties, including national, regional and local operators, acquirers and developers of healthcare-related real estate 
12

properties. The competition for healthcare-related real estate properties may significantly increase the price that we must pay for healthcare properties or other assets that we seek to acquire, and our competitors may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves. In addition, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more for the properties or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. In particular, larger REITs that target healthcare properties may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital, enhanced operating efficiencies, more personnel and market penetration and familiarity with markets. In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase. Increased competition would result in increased demand for the same assets and therefore increase prices paid for them. Those higher prices for healthcare properties or other assets may adversely affect our returns from our investments.
Insurance
We carry comprehensive liability insurance and property insurance covering our properties. In addition, tenants under long-term single-tenant net leases are required to carry property insurance covering our interest in the buildings.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we employed 16 people. The employees are not members of any labor union, and we consider our relations with our employees to be excellent.
Seasonality
Our business has not been, and we do not expect it to become subject to, material seasonal fluctuations.
