About Us 
Stagwell Inc. is the challenger network built to transform marketing. Stagwell delivers scaled creative performance for some of the world’s most ambitious brands, connecting creativity with leading-edge technology to harmonize the art and science of marketing. Led by entrepreneurs, as of December 31, 2022 we employed more than 12,000 people in more than 34 countries across the globe who drive effectiveness and improve business results for our more than 4,000 blue-chip customers. In addition, our affiliate network adds coverage in over 30 additional countries. 
Stagwell offers the capabilities marketers need in the digital age: Digital Transformation, Performance Media & Data, Consumer Insights & Strategy, and Creativity & Communications. Our global scale allows us to compete for many of the largest marketing contracts available, including multi-regional contracts with annual fees of more than $10 million. Stagwell operates in a highly competitive and fragmented industry, but we believe have a distinct advantage given our digital composition and its alignment with the broader marketplace. Additionally, the Stagwell Marketing Cloud, our proprietary suite of software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) and data-as-a-service (“DaaS”) technology solutions for in-house marketers, spans research and insights, communications technology, specialty media (including augmented reality), and media studios. Stagwell provides a suite of marketing services that serve marketers’ needs as well as tech-driven solutions for in-house marketers. Through the Stagwell Marketing Cloud, Stagwell is investing in the frontiers of marketing, with technology products that fuel augmented reality (“AR”) experiences for stadium goers and live events, and artificial intelligence (“AI”) for content creation and for communications professionals. This is a key part of the future strategy for the company.
Stagwell has grown through a combination of organic growth and investment. Beginning with a single company in 2015, Stagwell focused on the fastest-growing area of marketing: digital services. Between 2015 and 2021, we acquired companies including digital transformation and digital media groups like Code and Theory and ForwardPMX. In 2019, Stagwell Media made a $100 million investment into MDC, the parent company of creative powerhouses including 72andSunny, Anomaly, Crispin, Porter & Bogusky, Doner and Forsman & Bodenfors. Recognizing the potential of those companies, Stagwell’s 
reorganization and careful management of the portfolio turned MDC around. In August 2021, Stagwell Media completed the Transactions with MDC to become Stagwell Inc.
Stagwell’s unified corporate team is the foundation of a powerful value creation platform focused on scaling our portfolio of marketing services firms, which we refer to as Brands, and driving continual network evolution. We plan to invest in our core digital platforms, continue developing our suite of digital products in the Stagwell Marketing Cloud, increase our technology leadership through investment and innovation, and further expand our international footprint both organically and via our Global Affiliate Network to deliver value for our clients, employees, and shareholders.
Our Market
Industry Trends 
The digital revolution has changed where and how brands relate to consumers and created an entirely new, highly complex content and commerce ecosystem. Historically, marketing was characterized by television and brand advertising targeted to broad audiences: everyone saw the same advertisement at the same time. Over the last 15 years, digital innovation has created new, personalized ways to reach targeted consumers and spurred a fundamental shift in the marketing services landscape. Growth now comes primarily from digital marketing, helping brands meet customers across the entire online ecosystem. We believe every company today at its core is a digital marketing company. 
Five key trends describe the industry today:
First, online advertising now accounts for more than half of global advertising spend with the shift further accelerating as new media channels like connected television and platforms like Snap diversify the digital channels dominating content and commerce. Online now means virtually everywhere: website, mobile, social media, television, out-of-home, and immersive in-person experiences. 
Second, advertising is commerce. Digital platforms provide ways for brands to reach consumers directly through e-commerce. Platforms as diverse as TikTok and LinkedIn have created new ways for brands to interact with their customers. Brands can sell their products directly on their sites, via digital platforms such as Amazon or through interactive experiences enabled by social media. Digital platforms also allow advocacy groups and political campaigns to reach constituents to mobilize support or raise funds online. Retail media networks add complexity and opportunity to brands’ consumer engagement approaches. 
Third, data is everywhere. Platform and channel growth has created an explosion of addressable data that can be used to better understand consumer desires, habits, and needs in real-time, allowing the delivery of content that consumers want, when they want it, and where they want it. New sources of online data include web, mobile, email, social, and connected TV – in addition to emerging products, apps and wearables that enhance day-to-day experiences. The emergence of vast amounts of data spans behavioral, transactional, demographic, psychographic and geographic categories. As connectivity grows, the value of raw data declines – but we believe the ability to derive actionable insights from the data, as Stagwell businesses do, increases.
Fourth, frontier technology such as AI and AR are gaining critical foothold among mass consumers, reshaping how businesses connect. Both technologies have evolved past initial niche or enterprise use cases and are now reaching lay consumers, and businesses now are investing in making them widely accessible to consumer audiences, as seen with generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Stagwell Marketing Cloud’s ARound. Stagwell is at the forefront of this technology, implementing these innovations across our client work, and incubating original and proprietary technology that drives business results and sits on the next frontier of marketing. 
Finally, marketing technology is transforming the industry. SaaS and DaaS products are increasing the efficiency of marketing campaigns and in-house marketing operations, utilizing cutting edge technologies such as AI and automated media modeling, scaled consumer insights, campaign and asset management, brand reputation tracking, and more.
Competitive Landscape 
Stagwell operates in a highly competitive and fragmented industry. Stagwell’s Brands compete for business and talent with the operating subsidiaries of large global holding companies such as Omnicom Group Inc., Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., WPP plc, Publicis Groupe SA, Dentsu Inc. and Havas SA, as well as with numerous independent agencies that operate in multiple markets. Our Brands also face competition from consultancies, like Accenture and Deloitte, tech platforms, media companies and other services firms that offer related services. Stagwell’s Brands must compete with these other companies to maintain and grow existing client relationships and to obtain new clients and assignments. Individual products within the Stagwell Marketing Cloud also typically compete with offerings that may be provided within broader service offerings at large global holding companies or provided on a standalone basis by technology startups or other industry participants such as Infosys, Wipro and Cognizant.
During the decades when marketing was dominated by television, the marketing services industry experienced significant consolidation as legacy advertising holding companies built substantial portfolios of often overlapping creative, communications, PR, and media businesses to achieve financial efficiencies by centralizing administrative operations. These holding companies grew significantly in size and market share.
The rapid rise of digital channels, convergence of advertising and commerce, explosion in addressable data and marketing technology created a paradigm shift in the industry. While legacy models still accounted for a significant share of the market in 2021, we believe they are largely underexposed to the digital areas of the market experiencing the highest levels of client demand growth. In recent years, a number of large consulting firms with information technology implementation backgrounds have entered the marketing services market and, collectively, achieved significant market share. However, we believe these firms’ lack of creative and media expertise limits their long-term growth potential as true challengers to the legacy marketing holding companies.
With a combination of talent and technology, we believe that Stagwell is well positioned to take advantage of the continued transformation sweeping the marketing ecosystem and to disrupt the marketing services landscape. Stagwell was born digital and now has a global network of entrepreneurial companies that deliver the right combination of creativity and technology for the modern, digital marketer through a model that emphasizes flexibility and integration. 
Our Offering 
Principal Capabilities
Stagwell’s Brands provide differentiated, digital-first marketing and related services to a diverse client base across many industries.
Our principal capabilities fall into four categories: 1) Digital Transformation, 2) Performance Media & Data, 3) Consumer Insights & Strategy, and 4) Creativity & Communications. Taken together, these capabilities provide an integrated suite of marketing services for our blue-chip customer base.
Digital Transformation. We design and build digital platforms and experiences that support the delivery of content, commerce, services and sales. We create websites, mobile applications, back-end systems, content and data management systems, and other digital environments enabling clients to engage with consumers across the digital ecosystem. We design and implement technology and data strategies to support digital services needed for our clients. We also implement technology and strategies for utilizing digital channels to mobilize and raise funds from proponents and constituents to support political candidates, non-profit groups and issue organizations in the public arena. Lastly, we develop proprietary, in-house software and related technology products, including AI-based communications technology, cookie-less data platforms for advanced audience 
targeting and activation, software tools for e-commerce applications, specialty media solutions in the fast-growing augmented reality space, and innovative applications of text messaging for consumer engagement, which we license to clients using subscription-based SaaS and DaaS models. 
Performance Media & Data. We develop omnichannel media strategies and provide coordinated execution for the placement of advertisements across the media funnel including digital channels, performance marketing and analog placements globally. Unlike legacy holding companies that own large amounts of television inventory and therefore must sell it, we take a media-agnostic approach leveraging digital technologies and media in addition to analog advertising. Our media services include media solutions such as audience analysis, and media buying and planning, ranging across the platforms a modern marketer needs to engage consumers.
Consumer Insights & Strategy. We perform large-scale online surveys, specialized research, and data analytics across the consumer journey to provide strategic insights and guidance that informs business content, product, communications and media strategies for many of the world’s largest companies, including numerous Fortune 100 clients. We have differentiated specialization in brand and corporate reputation tracking, theatrical and streaming content and strategy, and technology product design and marketing, and we believe our Brands are at the forefront of innovation in the field.
Creativity & Communications. We develop holistic, creativity-based content strategies and campaigns from concept to execution through to optimization. These services include strategy development, advertising creation, live events, immersive digital experiences, cross platform engagement, and social media content. We also provide strategic communications, public relations and public affairs services including media relations, thought leadership, investor and financial relations, social media, executive positioning and visibility.
We group our Brands into these principal capability categories based on the source of most of their revenue. We also classify Digital Transformation, Performance Media & Data, and Consumer Insights & Strategy as “Digital” though Brands categorized as Creativity & Communications generate a significant portion of revenue from creativity and content delivered on digital channels and some, such as 72andSunny and Anomaly, do meaningful amounts of digital work that fluctuates as a percentage of revenue. We believe our concentration of digital capabilities today provides a competitive advantage in the marketplace and positions us to benefit from continued digital disruption in the marketing services industry. We plan to continue to invest in our core digital platforms as well as emerging technologies to effectively support marketing transformation for our clients.
Network Structure & Reportable Segments
Stagwell maintains a 100% ownership position in substantially all of its Brands, and the remainder are majority owned with management of the Brands owning the remaining equity. Stagwell generally has rights to increase ownership of non-wholly owned subsidiaries to 100% over a defined period of time. 
The Company organizes its Brands into three reportable segments: “Integrated Agencies Network,” “Brand Performance Network” and the “Communications Network.” In addition, the Company combines and discloses operating segments that do not meet the aggregation criteria as “All Other.” The Company also reports corporate expenses, as further detailed below, as “Corporate.”
The reportable segments are:
•The Integrated Agencies Network includes five operating segments: the Anomaly Alliance, Constellation, the Doner Partner Network, Code and Theory, and National Research Group. The operating segments offer an array of complementary services spanning our core capabilities of Digital Transformation, Performance Media & Data, Consumer Insights & Strategy, and Creativity & Communications. The Brands included in the operating segments that comprise the Integrated Agencies Network reportable segment are as follows: Anomaly Alliance (Anomaly, Concentric, Hunter, Mono, YML and Scout (Brands), Constellation (72andSunny, Colle McVoy, Instrument, Redscout, Hello Design, Team Enterprises, and Harris Insights), the Doner Partner Network (Doner, KWT Global, Harris X, Veritas, Doner North, Northstar, which is currently sunsetting, and Yamamoto (Brands)), Code and Theory and National Research Group.
These operating segments share similar characteristics related to (i) the nature of their services; (ii) the type of clients and the methods used to provide services; and (iii) the extent to which they may be impacted by global economic and geopolitical risks. In addition, these operating segments may occasionally compete with each other for new business or have business move between them.
•The Brand Performance Network (“BPN”), previously referred to as the “Media Network” reportable segment, is comprised of a single operating segment. BPN includes a unified media and data management structure with omnichannel media placement, creative media consulting, influencer and business-to-business marketing capabilities. Our Brands in this segment aim to provide scaled creative performance through developing and executing 
sophisticated omnichannel campaign strategies leveraging significant amounts of consumer data. BPN’s Brands provide media solutions such as audience analysis, media planning, and buying across a range of digital and traditional platforms (out-of-home, paid search, social media, lead generation, programmatic, television, broadcast, among others) and includes multichannel Brands Assembly, Brand New Galaxy, Crispin Porter Bogusky, Forsman & Bodenfors, Bruce Mau Design, Goodstuff, MMI Agency, digital creative & transformation consultancy Gale, B2B specialist Multiview, Observatory, Vitro, CX specialists Kenna, and travel media experts Ink.
•The Communications Network reportable segment is comprised of a single operating segment, our specialist network that provides advocacy, strategic corporate communications, investor relations, public relations, online fundraising and other services to both corporations and political and advocacy organizations and consists of our Allison & Partners SKDK (including Sloane & Company), and Targeted Victory brands. 
•All Other consists of the Company’s digital innovation group and Stagwell Marketing Cloud, including Maru and Epicenter, and products such as PRophet, ARound and Reputation Defender (which was sold in September 2021). 
•Corporate consists of corporate office expenses incurred in connection with the strategic resources provided to the operating segments, as well as certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to the operating segments. These office and general expenses include (i) salaries and related expenses for corporate office employees, including employees dedicated to supporting the operating segments, (ii) occupancy expenses relating to properties occupied by all corporate office employees, (iii) other office and general expenses including professional fees for the financial statement audits and other public company costs, and (iv) certain other professional fees managed by the corporate office. Additional expenses managed by the corporate office that are directly related to the operating segments are allocated to the appropriate reportable segment and the All Other category. 
Go-To-Market Strategy
Our global go-to-market strategy is key to our objective of providing our clients with a balanced combination of leading-edge technology and creative talent. We go to market in four main ways: as individual Brands, as networks where collaboration across services is needed, as Stagwell Global when we create multi-region, Stagwell-wide teams, and as the Stagwell Marketing Cloud, which delivers SaaS and DaaS products for in-house marketers. 
Unlike legacy holding companies who have focused on achieving cost synergies by consolidating brands within their networks, Stagwell focuses on collaboration. We believe it is important for our Brands to maintain their individual identities to attract the highest quality talent within their capabilities of expertise. Maintaining strong brand identities within our integrated Brands and specialist networks provides a structure supporting both individual and joint go-to-market approaches. Maintaining separate Brands with flexibility to integrate also enables effective management of potential conflicts of interest. Go-to-market collaboration typically occurs on larger engagements requiring services across multiple capabilities or geographies.
To further support collaboration, Stagwell provides financial incentives for Brands to collaborate with one another through referrals and the sharing of both services and expertise. Network and Brand leaders have components of incentive compensation that are based on Stagwell’s overall performance and the overall performance of their integrated or specialist networks to incentivize go-to-market collaboration.
In addition to our owned Brands, we maintain a network of go-to-market alliances with like-minded independent brands, tech companies and marketing services firms in key markets around the world. These partners, which we refer to as Global Affiliates, enable us to increase our local-market reach and qualify for business opportunities that require enhanced capabilities in specific local markets without taking on additional costs. Launched in early 2021, by December 2022 the Global Affiliate Network had achieved its goal of growing to include more than 75 affiliates.
Our distinct Brand structure enables us to work with multiple clients within the same business sector, and many of our largest clients are served by multiple Brands or Brands in our portfolio. The Brands’ work is supported by a centralized marketing and new business team that fosters collaboration, sources new business opportunities and communicates across industries to drive awareness of our offerings. Additionally, a centralized corporate innovation team develops and invests in proprietary digital marketing products that are distributed by Brands across the network, further enhancing the value proposition Stagwell Brands are able to offer clients.
Our Strategy
The key components of the Stagwell strategy are Digital, Integrated, Global, and Strategic (“DIGS”). We believe the DIGS model gives us a sustainable, long-term path to significant growth and supports our primary objectives which are sustaining strong levels of organic growth, increasing our digital revenue mix, increasing international scale, expanding the average client relationship size, and maintaining strong margins and free cash flow. We believe pursuing these objectives will position us to increase value for our shareholders.
Our strategy is focused around six specific initiatives: 1) Investing in Digital Capabilities, 2) Expanding Addressable Markets, 3) Effective Integration at Scale, 4) Strategic Value Creation Platform, 5) Maintaining a Highly Variable Cost Structure, and 6) Efficient Capital Allocation.
Investing in Digital Capabilities
Our digital businesses serve the areas where we expect the fastest growth in the marketing space and position us to lead the wave of transformation in the industry. By investing in our core digital platforms and introducing proprietary SaaS and DaaS marketing technology (“martech”) products, we aim to increase the digital proportion of our net revenue. We aim to expand our digital capabilities in three main ways:
•First, we intend to continue to invest in our leading digital Brands like Code and Theory, Instrument and YML. This planned investment includes funding new capabilities and supporting cross-selling via our Integrated Agencies Network, which has already created additional opportunities.
•Second, we intend to pursue complementary acquisition opportunities to bolster our existing assets in areas such as digital transformation and digital media buying. We have built a successful track record of “bolt-on” acquisitions such as TrueLogic Software, LLC, Ramenu S.A. and Polar Bear Development S.R.L., a Latin America engineering shop, and Kettle Solutions, LLC (“Kettle”), a content and digital design firm.
•Third, we are investing in the Stagwell Marketing Cloud, a suite of technology products in development or early-stage commercialization spanning influencer marketing, audience segmentation, public relations, immersive experiences and brand insights. These products are licensed to our clients using subscription-based SaaS and DaaS models and distributed by Brands across our network. We believe the Stagwell Marketing Cloud positions us to serve in-house marketing departments and create recurring, high-value revenue streams in the future. We have also made strategic acquisitions for the Stagwell Marketing Cloud, including Epicenter Experience, an enterprise software company that leverages mobile and location data to map and sequence complex consumer behavior patterns, and Maru Group, a leading software experience and insights data platform.
Expanding Addressable Markets
We are focused on expanding our addressable markets through investments that increase our global footprint as well as adding emerging marketing technologies in areas expected to have strong secular growth. We believe increasing our geographic presence and breadth of capabilities will allow us to significantly grow our average client relationship size over time.
•International Markets: Our strategy for growing our international operations is focused on expanding our media buying, content creation and digital capabilities in new markets, which will improve our qualifications for large multi-regional contracts with the largest global marketers. For example, in April 2022, we acquired Brand New Galaxy, a scaled provider of end-to-end e-commerce services such as DTC strategy, digital content production, automation, and complex technology implementations. The acquisition bolsters Stagwell's broad e-commerce capabilities to service more global clients and provides significant scale in Europe. 
•We maintain a Global Affiliate network that enables us to deliver creative, performance, media and technology capabilities at the scale required to serve the world’s largest marketers. Our affiliates provide local talent and insights for regional engagements without requiring investment capital. We believe our Global Affiliates will be a valuable source for acquisitions, allowing Stagwell to vet companies before formal investment. Brand New Galaxy was our first affiliate and affiliate acquisition. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 75 Global Affiliate partners in our network.
•Emerging Marketing Technologies: In addition to the advertising and marketing services market, we believe our investments in the Stagwell Marketing Cloud will position us to address new, rapidly expanding market opportunities, including marketing data, campaign martech, the metaverse, and AR and VR applications. For example, Stagwell’s shared AR product ARound has launched stadium-level experiences with professional sporting teams in Major League Baseball and the National Football League, namely the Minnesota Twins and the Los Angeles Rams.
Effective Integration at Scale
We expect to derive significant long-term operating efficiencies from the Transactions through initiatives that have been and continue to be rolled out over the 36 months following the completion of the Transactions. We have made progress against our plan and anticipate the initial expected synergies will be realized over a period of 36 months from the time of the Transactions. We expect the synergies will come from implementation of shared services across the Company, elimination of redundancies in the Stagwell Brand Performance Network, scaling operational resources in lower cost markets, and third-party spend recapture, among other cost-saving initiatives.
 Within our client-facing integrated and specialist networks we see further opportunity to achieve operating efficiencies by increasing our non-U.S. based engineering footprint. We are focused on scaling our development capabilities in lower cost 
markets, specifically Latin America, India, and Southeast Asia. Our engineering talent is primarily focused on building and designing digital platforms, applications, tools, and experiences for our clients and are typically more highly concentrated in our Brands categorized within our Digital Transformation primary capability. We believe we already have a substantial engineering presence globally – more than 1,500 engineers total as of December 31, 2022 – and have developed the necessary skills to support hiring, training and managing large teams outside the United States. We believe these markets offer a significant supply of quality technical talent to meet increasing client demand for high-speed delivery of digital transformation and production services.
Stagwell Value Creation Platform
We believe our engaged, unified corporate team provides a growth platform for value creation through both revenue and cost synergies for our existing Brands and prospective investments. We are led by a management team with deep industry expertise and a track record of growing and managing marketing services businesses. The Stagwell platform provides a foundation to support efficient, accretive scaling of our global network and our high-growth digital transformation and digital media capabilities. Our corporate objective is to accelerate the growth and improve the profitability of our Brands, and we believe Brands see strategic value in being part of the Stagwell network.
Our value creation platform has three layers: Client Services, Growth Investment and Shared Services.
Our Client Services layer aims to facilitate revenue growth through go-to-market support. Our Global Solutions team provides a single point of contact for key clients, coordinating our go-to-market strategies for large, multi-regional contracts or business opportunities requiring cross-Brand, cross-capability or cross-market services. Our Global Growth team provides prospecting and new business services to our Brands, working in partnership with our Brand team which supports messaging and communications efforts. At the network level, the Stagwell Brand Performance Network provides a corporate structure to cost-effectively coordinate our global media placement capabilities, while our Global Affiliate Network positions our Brands to pitch for and win opportunities requiring capabilities in specific local markets.
Our Growth Investment layer is designed to drive continual network evolution and bolsters competitive advantages in key markets, capabilities, and emerging technologies and consists of two teams: centralized investment and innovation. Our central investment team, which has a strong track record of accretive investments, provides expertise in sourcing, negotiating and structuring investments in close partnership with our Brand leadership, to drive efficient scaling of our networks and accelerate growth. In addition to our investment team, a centralized innovation team provides development capabilities for the Stagwell Marketing Cloud and bespoke client needs.
Our Shared Services layer provides unified back-office systems via Stagwell CORE (“CORE”), the Company’s newly formed platform that focuses on transitioning away from disparate teams, processes and systems and establishing a standardized platform. CORE provides centralized services across back office operational functions, including information technology (“IT”), accounts payable and receivable, real estate, enterprise-level contract administration, and accounting services. With a focus on driving shareholder value by optimizing cost structures and facilitating efficient integration of acquired businesses, CORE’s services are highly standardized with an emphasis on scalability to support Stagwell’s growth.
Maintaining a Highly Variable Cost Structure 
We are focused on maintaining a business model that has attractive cash flow, revenue growth and margin expansion and plan to maintain a highly variable cost structure that allows us to be nimble. We aim to focus our investments on people-based businesses that operate with a high percentage of variable costs. Our at-will employment structure positions us to respond rapidly to changing market conditions in order to maintain margins. We also strive to diligently deploy low capital investment strategies. For example, we believe our Global Affiliate Network strategy for expanding international capabilities positions us to maintain a high level of flexibility through macroeconomic cycles. 
Our management team has successfully demonstrated an ability to efficiently operate, manage and grow a profitable portfolio of diverse advertising businesses through periods of dramatic changes in consumer behavior, technological advancement and economic cycles. The team has a successful track record of investing, acquisition execution and integration as well as recruiting and retaining the key talent that drives our operating businesses.
Efficient Capital Allocation
We are focused on delivering continued strong organic growth and free cash flow to support efficient capital allocation that generates value for our shareholders. Our primary use of capital is expected to be funding diligently structured, highly accretive investment in businesses we believe will support sustainable future growth by increasing the breadth and depth of our capabilities. We also expect more modest capital allocation towards minimizing shareholder dilution, reducing leverage in order to provide increased financial flexibility, and funding development of proprietary technology and products for the Stagwell Marketing Cloud. 
Our Clients
As of December 31, 2022 Stagwell served over 4,000 clients across a wide range of sectors, representing some of the world’s most recognized brands including: Google, Amazon, Diageo, Nike, Apple, P&G, Novo Nordisk, United Airlines, Salesforce and more. In many cases, we serve the same clients in various geographic locations, across multiple disciplines, and through multiple Stagwell Brands. Representation of a client rarely means that Stagwell handles marketing communications for all brands or product lines of the client in every geographical location. In 2022, net revenue from our top 100 clients’ increased by over 15% year-over-year as we saw record new business and increasing interest in both specific Brand capabilities as well as cross-Brand, integrated solutions that address multi-discipline client needs.
Stagwell’s Brands have written contracts with many of their clients. As is customary in the industry, these contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Executive Overview” for a further discussion of Stagwell’s arrangements with its clients.
Sources of Revenue 
Stagwell provides a broad range of services to a large base of clients across a wide spectrum of verticals globally. Stagwell has historically been largely focused in North America where the Company was founded, as well as the United Kingdom, but has expanded its global footprint to support clients globally and has a presence in more than 34 countries, and an additional more than 30 countries through our Global Affiliate Network, in each case as of December 31, 2022. The primary source of revenue is from agency arrangements in the form of fees for services performed, commissions, and from performance incentives or bonuses. Stagwell’s Brands have written contracts with many of their clients. As is customary in the industry, these contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Executive Overview” for a further discussion of Stagwell’s arrangements with its clients.
Seasonality
Historically, we have typically generated the highest quarterly revenue during the fourth quarter in each year due to consumer marketing increases from the back-to-school and holiday seasons. In addition, we have typically seen an increase in revenue in the third and fourth quarters during even years because our advocacy business has higher revenue during the biannual U.S. election cycle. 
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 11,100 full-time employees and approximately 1,050 contractors. The following table provides a breakdown of the approximate number of full-time employees and contractors across Stagwell’s three reportable segments, the All Other category, and Corporate:

Segment | Total 
Integrated Agencies Network | 5,800 
Brand Performance Network | 4,650 
Communications Network | 1,100 
All Other | 300 
Corporate | 300 
Total | 12,150

Because of the personal service nature of the marketing and communications business, our talent is of critical importance to our success. Human capital management strategies are developed by senior management, including the management teams of our Brands, and are overseen at the corporate level.
Our human capital management priorities include providing competitive benefits & compensation, attracting and retaining talent, supporting learning & development across the network, promoting Diversity & Inclusion, increasing employee engagement, and ensuring workplace safety. At the corporate level, centralized human capital management processes include development of human resources governance and policy, executive compensation for senior leaders, benefits programs, and succession planning focusing on the performance, development and retention of key senior executives.
Benefits & Compensation
Stagwell provides a full range of competitive benefits including medical, dental, vision, employer-funded HSAs, commuter assistance, 401k, employee stock programs and more. Health benefits are offered to full-time employees and their dependents, inclusive of domestic and/or same-sex partners. We offer flexible paid time off as well as accommodation for civic duties, 
bereavement, and leaves of absence. Stagwell participates in industry-wide salary surveys and utilizes AI-powered compensation software to obtain real-time compensation survey data and analytics and ensure all compensation decisions are data-driven. In addition, we have various stock ownership programs for eligible Stagwell employees.
Attracting & Retaining Talent
Hiring and retaining transformative talent is key to Stagwell’s mission. We supplement agency-led recruiting with central recruiting support. Leveraging our scale, we have developed a broad database of global talent that further enhances our recruiting activities. In addition to utilizing central resources and technology, Brand-level recruiting activities include partnerships with colleges/universities, internship programs, referral programs and diversity, equity and inclusion specific pipelining programs. Stagwell’s internal transfer policy and career portal on our intranet, The Hive, also enables employees to explore new positions with other Brands at the Company to support retention of talent within the broader network.
We have regular learning and talent events so employees across our network can feel connected to the broader portfolio of Stagwell companies and enhance collaboration.
Learning & Development
At the corporate level, Stagwell invests in both our senior leadership and up-and-coming leaders through a professional development partnership with a globally recognized leadership development organization. The program is designed to align individual growth with organizational strategy to help achieve success across both. Furthermore, Stagwell provides eligible employees with an annual, flexible professional development budget to utilize if they want to explore more opportunities within their field, acquire new skills, and enhance their contributions to their department and the organization. In addition, each Brand maintains its own policies and development programs suitable to its workforce and leadership goals.
Diversity & Inclusion
We believe the cultures of Stagwell’s individual Brands are what sets working at Stagwell apart; however, the connective tissue that unites us is our vision for our Brands and people to work collaboratively across disciplines in an inclusive environment. 
Stagwell supports its Brands through access to high-quality education, resources and technology, which they can use to bring inclusion to life based on their organization’s needs. In addition to providing annual harassment prevention and ethics training globally, we actively collect data modeled after equal employment opportunity classifications with the goal of ensuring our employee demographics better reflect the diversity of the communities in which our workforce operates and is hired from and to identify areas for improvement through corporate engagement and initiatives. In addition, Stagwell aims to continue to grow successful partnerships with diverse vendors, suppliers, contractors, and consultants. 
We believe doubling down on creating an inclusive environment, from building internal and external partnerships, fostering the collaboration amongst our Brands, to trying out ideas and programs from our teams and Brands, will attract and retain a diverse workforce and that the diversity of thought creates impact for our clients globally. 
Employee Engagement
Regular communication is a commitment at Stagwell. We have quarterly global Town Halls to ensure staff are engaged with and organizational goals are shared. And with in-person events returning in earnest, our Brand and Talent teams collaborate to host a variety of experiential, wellness, and professional development/thought leadership programs at our New York City “HUB” locations at the World Trade Center and in other offices around the world. Our global CEO sends out regular emails to all staff with key updates ranging from new business wins to client work. In addition, the Hive intranet serves as a resource portal for all Stagwell employees. We additionally maintain several global communities organized around discrete disciplines (“Technology,” “Growth,” “Communications,” etc.) to foster collaboration and engagement with the center of the company.
Significant Factors Affecting our Business and Results of Operations
The most significant factors affecting our business and results of operations include national, regional, and local economic conditions, our clients’ profitability, mergers and acquisitions of our clients, changes in top management of our clients and our ability to retain and attract key employees. New business wins and client losses occur due to a variety of factors. We believe the two most significant factors are (i) our clients’ desire to change marketing communication firms and (ii) the digital and data-driven products that our Brands offer. A client may choose to change marketing communication firms for several reasons, such as a change in leadership where new management wants to retain a firm that it may have previously worked with. In addition, if the client is merged or acquired by another company, the marketing communication firm is often changed. Clients also change firms as a result of the firm’s failure to meet marketing performance targets or other expectations in client service delivery.
Regulatory Environment
The marketing and communications services that our Brands provide are subject to laws and regulations in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These include laws and regulations that affect the form and content of marketing and communications activities that we produce for our clients and, for our digital services, laws and regulations concerning user privacy, use of personal information, data protection and online tracking technologies. We are also subject to laws and regulations that govern whether and how we can receive, transfer or process data that we use in our operations, including data shared between countries in which we operate. Our international operations are also subject to broad anti-corruption laws. While these laws and regulations could impact our operations, we believe compliance in the normal course of the Company’s business has not significantly impacted the services we provide or had a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial position.
