Item 1.  BUSINESS
General
 
CNL Healthcare Properties, Inc. is a Maryland corporation that incorporated on June 8, 2010.  We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for United States (“U.S.”) federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ended December 31, 2012 and our intention is to be organized and operate in a manner that allows us to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  The terms “us,” “we,” “our,” “Company” and “CNL Healthcare Properties” include CNL Healthcare Properties, Inc. and each of its subsidiaries. 
 
We contributed the net proceeds from our public offerings (“Offerings”) to CHP Partners, LP (“Operating Partnership”) in exchange for partnership interests.  Substantially all of our assets are held by, and all operations are conducted, either directly or indirectly, through: (1) the Operating Partnership in which we are the sole limited partner and our wholly owned subsidiary, CHP GP, LLC, is the sole general partner; (2) a wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”), CHP TRS Holding, Inc.; (3) property owner subsidiaries and lender subsidiaries, which are single purpose entities; and (4) investments in joint ventures.
 
On September 30, 2015, we completed our Offerings pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 under the Securities Act of 1933 with the SEC.  Through the close of our Offerings, we received aggregate subscription proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion.  In October 2015, we deregistered the unsold shares of our common stock under our previous registration statement on Form S-11, except for 20 million shares that we concurrently registered on Form S-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 with the SEC for the sale of additional shares of common stock through our distribution reinvestment plan (“Reinvestment Plan”).  As part of moving forward with the consideration of Possible Strategic Alternatives, as described below under “Strategic Alternatives,” effective July 11, 2018, we suspended our Reinvestment Plan and, effective with the suspension of our Reinvestment Plan, stockholders who were participants in our Reinvestment Plan now receive cash distributions instead of additional shares of our common stock.
 
Our offices are located at 450 South Orange Avenue within the CNL Center at City Commons in Orlando, Florida, 32801, and our telephone number is (407) 650-1000.
 
Advisor
 
We are externally managed and advised by CNL Healthcare Corp. (“Advisor”).  Our Advisor has responsibility for our day-to-day operations, serving as our consultant in connection with policy decisions to be made by our board of directors, and for identifying, recommending and executing acquisitions (through the completion of our acquisition phase in 2016) and dispositions on our behalf pursuant to an advisory agreement.  In April 2018, we extended the advisory agreement through June 2019.  In addition, in June 2018, the property management agreement between us and CNL Healthcare Manager Corp. (“Property Manager”) expired.  In exchange for these services, our Advisor and Property Manager received certain fees from us.  For additional information on our Advisor, its affiliates or other related parties, as well as the fees and reimbursements we pay, see Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” – Note 11. “Related Party Arrangements.”
Strategic Alternatives
 
We completed our acquisition phase in 2016.  In 2017, we began evaluating strategic alternatives to provide liquidity to the Company’s stockholders. In April 2018, our board of directors formed a special committee consisting solely of our independent directors (“Special Committee”) to consider possible strategic alternatives, including, but not limited to (i) the listing of the Company’s or one of its subsidiary’s common stock on a national securities exchange, (ii) an orderly disposition of the Company’s assets or one or more of the Company’s asset classes and the distribution of the net sale proceeds thereof to the stockholders of the Company and (iii) a potential business combination or other transaction with a third party or parties that provides the stockholders of the Company with cash and/or securities of a publicly traded company (collectively, among other options, “Possible Strategic Alternatives”).  HFF Securities L.P. and KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. serve as financial advisors to the Special Committee in connection with exploring our Possible Strategic Alternatives.    
 
4


In connection with our consideration of the Possible Strategic Alternatives, we suspended both our Reinvestment Plan and our stock redemption plan (“Redemption Plan”) effective July 11, 2018.  Moreover, in September 2018, our board of directors committed to a plan to sell 53 medical office buildings (“MOB”), five post-acute care facilities and five acute care hospitals across the US (collectively, the “MOB/Healthcare Portfolio”).  Accordingly, the MOB/Healthcare Portfolio consisting of 63 properties has been classified as held for sale and the corresponding operations were classified as discontinued operations because the sale of these properties represented a strategic shift in our operations. In December 2018, we entered into an agreement of purchase and sale (“MOB Sale Agreement”) with a subsidiary of Welltower Inc. (NYSE: WELL) for the sale of 55 properties within our MOB/Healthcare Portfolio (“MOB Sale”) for a gross sales price of $1.25 billion, subject to certain pro-rations and other adjustments as described in the MOB Sale Agreement.  The parties anticipate that the closing of the MOB Sale will occur in the first half of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions, governmental and other third-party consents.  There can be no assurance that the closing conditions will be satisfied or that the MOB Sale will be consummated.  To date, approximately $76 million has been placed by the buyer in escrow, which is non-refundable, except for a seller breach or default under the MOB Sale Agreement, and will be applied to the purchase price at closing.
 
In December 2018, we also committed to a plan to sell our Welbrook Senior Living Grand Junction property.  We had also previously committed to a plan to sell our six skilled nursing facilities in Arkansas.    As of December 31, 2018, we had classified a total of 70 properties as held for sale, for which the operations of the 63 properties comprising our MOB/Healthcare Portfolio were classified as discontinued operations as described above.
 
In March 2019, we entered into an agreement of purchase and sale (“IRF Sale Agreement”) with subsidiaries of Global Medical REIT Inc. (NYSE: GMRE) related to the sale of four post-acute care properties within our MOB/Healthcare Portfolio (“IRF Sale”) for a gross sales price of $94 million, subject to certain pro-rations and other adjustments as described in the IRF Sale Agreement.  The parties anticipate that the closing of the IRF Sale will occur in the first half of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions, governmental and other third-party consents.  There can be no assurance that the closing conditions will be satisfied or that the IRF Sale will be consummated.  To date, approximately $1.5 million has been placed by the buyer in escrow, which is non-refundable, except for a seller breach or default under the IRF Sale Agreement, and will be applied to the purchase price at closing.
 
During 2019, we intend to execute on our plan to sell the 70 properties that we had classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018.  Our board of directors will determine the appropriate use of any net proceeds resulting from the MOB Sale and the IRF Sale, which may include: (i) the retirement of indebtedness, including the pay down of our Credit Facilities; (ii) a special distribution to stockholders; (iii) strategic capital expenditures to enhance certain of our remaining properties and/or (iv) retaining a portion of the proceeds for other corporate purposes.
 
Investment Objectives and Strategy
 
Our primary investment objectives were to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets that would allow us to:
 
 
• | provide stockholders with attractive and stable cash distributions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preserve, protect and return stockholders’ invested capital; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | explore liquidity opportunities in the future, such as the sale of either the Company or our assets, a potential merger, or the listing of our common shares on a national securities exchange.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our investment objectives.  
 
The types of seniors housing properties that we acquired include independent and assisted living facilities, continuing care retirement communities and Alzheimer’s / memory care facilities.  The types of medical office facilities that we acquired include medical office buildings, specialty medical and diagnostic service facilities, surgery centers, outpatient rehabilitation facilities, and other facilities designed for clinical services. The types of post-acute care facilities that we acquired include skilled nursing facilities and inpatient rehabilitative facilities.  The types of acute care facilities that we acquired include specialty surgical hospitals.  We view, manage and evaluate our portfolio homogeneously as one collection of healthcare assets with a common goal of maximizing revenues and property income regardless of the asset class or asset type.  As part of executing on strategic alternatives, as of March 15, 2019, we had entered into the MOB Sale Agreement consisting of 55 properties and the IRF Sale Agreement consisting of four properties.

We have primarily leased our seniors housing properties to wholly owned TRS entities and engaged independent third-party managers under management agreements to operate the properties as permitted under the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007 (“RIDEA”).  We have also leased certain of our seniors housing properties to third-party tenants under triple-net or similar lease structures, where the tenant bears all or substantially all of the costs (including cost increases, for real estate taxes, utilities, insurance and ordinary repairs).  Medical office, post-acute care and acute care properties have been leased on a triple-net, net or modified gross basis to third-party tenants.  In addition, most of our investments are wholly owned, although, we have invested through partnerships with other entities where we believe it is appropriate and beneficial.  We have and continue to invest in existing property developments or properties that have not reached full stabilization.
 Dispositions 
 The determination of when a particular investment should be sold or otherwise disposed of may be made after considering all relevant factors, including overall strategic alternatives, tax considerations as well as prevailing and projected economic and market conditions (including whether the value of the property or other investment is anticipated to decline substantially).  The net proceeds, after payment of debt, received from any disposition may be distributed to stockholders or retained for corporate purposes.
Portfolio Overview
 We believe demographic trends and compelling supply and demand indicators presented a strong case for an investment focus on healthcare real estate and real estate-related assets. We believe that the healthcare sector will continue to provide attractive opportunities as compared to other asset sectors over the long-term.  Our healthcare investment portfolio is geographically diversified with properties in 34 states. The map below shows our current property allocations across geographic regions as of December 31, 2018:

As of December 31, 2018, our healthcare investment portfolio, including the 70 properties classified as held for sale, consisted of interests in 142 properties, including 72 seniors housing properties, 53 MOBs, 12 post-acute care facilities and five acute care hospitals.  Of our properties held at December 31, 2018, five of our 72 seniors housing properties were owned through an unconsolidated joint venture and one was comprised of unimproved land.  As of March 15, 2019, we had entered into the MOB Sale Agreement for the sale of the 55 properties comprising the MOB Sale, and we had entered into the IRF Sale Agreement for the sale of the four properties comprising the IRF Sale.  During 2019, we intend to continue executing on our plan to sell the 70 properties classified as held for sale.  The following table summarizes our healthcare portfolio by asset class and investment structure as of December 31, 2018:

Since inception, we invested approximately $299.8 million in 11 ground-up developments and four expansion projects, which was comprised on the following properties:

 FOOTNOTE:
  
(1) | We completed the sale of Dogwood Forest of Acworth in November 2016, which resulted in a gain on the sale of real estate of approximately $15.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we funded additional amounts related to our completed developments, currently in the lease-up phase.  During the lease-up phase, these types of investments generated limited cash flows from operations and resulted in near term downward pressure on our results of operations and net asset valuation.  As occupancy increases and as they approach stabilization, these investments will generate improved cash flows from operations and will contribute favorably on our results of operations.  However, we believe that investing a portion of our capital into these types of properties has been beneficial because the properties have provided a higher yield on cost and higher net asset valuations in the long-term as compared to stabilized acquisitions.  Additionally, over the long-term, these types of assets resulted in our portfolio having a lower average age.
 Portfolio Evaluation
 We monitor the performance of our tenants and third-party operators to stay abreast of any material changes in the operations of the underlying properties by (1) reviewing the current, historical and prospective operating margins (measured by a tenant’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and facility rent), (2) monitoring trends in the source of our tenants’ revenue, including the relative mix of public payors (including Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) and private payors (including commercial insurance and private pay patients), (3) evaluating the effect of evolving healthcare legislation and other regulations on our tenants’ profitability and liquidity, and (4) reviewing the competition and demographics of the local and surrounding areas in which the tenants operate.
 When evaluating the performance of our healthcare portfolio within the seniors housing and post-acute care asset classes, management reviews occupancy levels and monthly revenue per occupied unit, which we define as total revenue divided by average number of occupied units or beds and is considered a performance metric within these asset classes.  Similarly, within the medical office and acute care asset classes, management reviews operating statistics of the underlying properties, including occupancy levels and rent per square foot.  Lastly, when evaluating the performance of our third-party operators or developers, management reviews monthly financial statements, property level operating performance versus budgeted expectations, conducts periodic operational review calls with operators and conducts periodic property inspections or site visits.  
 8


We do not consider this information to be a non-generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) measure that can be reconciled to our GAAP financial statements because it includes the performance of properties that are leased to third-party tenants.  However, all of the aforementioned operating and statistical metrics assist us in determining the ability of our properties or operators to achieve market rental rates, to assess the overall performance of our diversified healthcare portfolio, and to review compliance with leases, debt, licensure, real estate taxes, and other collateral.
 Furthermore, in our evaluation of the properties, we consider the operating stage of the investments within the following stages: development, value-add or stabilizing and stabilized.  While we do not currently have any real estate under development, development properties are those in which we or our joint venture purchased land for the development of new operating properties.  We typically held rights as the owner or managing member of the development properties while a third-party or our joint venture partner managed the development, construction and certain day to day operations of the property subject to our oversight.  Stabilizing properties are either developed properties that have been fully constructed and in lease-up phase (typically 18 months post-construction) or existing (“value-add”) properties in which we expect to make capital investments to upgrade or expand.  A property is considered stabilized upon the earlier of (i) when the property reaches 85% occupancy for a trailing three month period, or (ii) a two year period from acquisition or completion of development.  For those assets that are above an 85% occupancy level and subsequently drop below 85%, they are reclassified to stabilizing until the assets attain the trailing three month 85% occupancy metric. 
 Significant Tenants and Operators 
 Our real estate portfolio is operated by a mix of national or regional operators and the following represent the significant tenants and operators that lease or manage 5% or more of our rentable space as of December 31, 2018, excluding the 63 properties comprising our MOB/Healthcare Portfolio, which were classified as discontinued operations:

While we are not directly impacted by the performance of the underlying properties leased to third-party tenants, we believe that the financial and operational performance of our tenants provides an indication about the stability of our tenants and their ability to pay rent. To the extent that our tenants, managers or joint venture partners experience operating difficulties and become unable to generate sufficient cash to make rent payments to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. Our tenants and managers are generally contractually required to provide this information to us in accordance with their respective lease, management and/or joint venture agreements. Therefore, in order to mitigate the aforementioned risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. 
 We monitor the credit of our tenants to stay abreast of any material changes in quality. We monitor tenant credit quality by (1) reviewing financial statements that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us under the applicable lease, (2) direct interaction with onsite property managers, (3) monitoring news and rating agency reports regarding our tenants (or their parent companies) and their underlying businesses, (4) monitoring the timeliness of rent collections and (5) monitoring lease coverage. 
 Tenant Lease Expirations
 As of December 31, 2018, we owned 85 properties (of which 70 properties were classified as held for sale, as described above under “Strategic Alternatives,” and of which 63 properties were classified as discontinued operations) that were leased to tenants on a triple-net, net or modified gross basis, and accounted for as operating leases.  During the year ended December 31, 2018, our rental income from continuing operations represented approximately 11.2% of our total revenues from continuing operations.  Under the terms of our triple-net lease agreements, each tenant is responsible for payment of property taxes, general liability insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, including structural and roof expenses (“Triple-net Lease”). Each tenant is expected to pay real estate taxes directly to taxing authorities.  However, if the tenant does not pay, we will be liable.  Under the terms of our net, modified gross or similar lease agreements for multi-tenant properties with third-party property managers, each tenant is responsible for the payment of their proportionate share of property taxes, general liability insurance, utilities, repairs and common area maintenance (“Modified Lease”). These amounts are billed monthly and recorded as tenant reimbursement income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 
 Our asset management team collaborates with existing tenants to understand their current and anticipated space needs in advance of their lease term renewal date.  As of December 31, 2018, none of our rental income from continuing operations was scheduled to expire until 2022.  Therefore, we do not expect lease turnover to have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations in the near term.  We work with and begin lease-related negotiations well in advance of the lease expirations or renewal period options in order for us to maintain a balanced lease rollover schedule and high occupancy levels, as well as to enhance the value of our properties through extended lease terms. Lease extensions are likely to create an obligation to pay lease commissions, lease incentives and/or tenant improvements and may also provide our tenants with some periods of reduced and/or “free rent.” Certain amendments or modifications to the terms of existing leases could require lender approval.

The following table lists, on an aggregate basis, scheduled expirations for the next 10 years ending December 31st and thereafter on our consolidated healthcare investment portfolio, excluding the 63 properties classified as discontinued operations, assuming that none of the tenants exercise any of their renewal options (in thousands, except for number of tenants and percentages) as of December 31, 2018:

Share Price Valuation
 
We have adopted a valuation policy designed to follow recommendations of the Investment Program Association (“IPA”), an industry trade group, in the IPA Practice Guideline 2013-01, Valuations of Publicly Registered Non-Listed REITs, which was adopted by the IPA effective May 1, 2013 (“IPA Valuation Guideline”). The purpose of our valuation policy is to establish guidelines to be followed in determining the NAV per share of our common stock for regulatory and investor reporting and on-going evaluation of investment performance.  NAV means the fair value of real estate, real estate-related investments and all other assets less the fair value of total liabilities. Our NAV will be determined based on the fair value of our assets less liabilities under market conditions existing as of the time of valuation and assuming the allocation of the resulting net value among our stockholders after any adjustments for incentive, preferred or special interests, if applicable. 
 
In accordance with our valuation policy and as recommended by the IPA Valuation Guideline, we expect to produce an estimated NAV per share at least annually as of December 31 and disclose such amount as soon as possible after year-end.  The audit committee of our board of directors, comprised of our independent directors (“Valuation Committee”), oversees our valuation process and engages one or more third-party valuation advisors to assist in the process of determining the estimated NAV per share of our common stock. 
 
To assist our board of directors in its determination of the estimated NAV per share of our common stock, our board of directors engaged an independent third-party valuation firm, Robert A. Stanger & Co., Inc. (“Stanger”), to provide property-level and aggregate valuation analyses of the Company and a range for the NAV per share of our common stock and to consider other information provided by our Advisor.  
 
For a detailed discussion of the determination of the estimated NAV per share of our common stock, including our valuation process and methodology, see Item 5.  “Market For Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters And Issuer Purchases Of Equity Securities – Market Information.”

Distributions
 
In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to make distributions, other than capital gain distributions, to our stockholders each year in the amount of at least 90% of our taxable income.  We may make distributions in the form of cash or other property, including distributions of our own securities. While we generally expect to pay distributions from cash flows provided by operating activities, we have and may continue to cover periodic shortfalls between distributions paid and cash flows provided by operating activities from other sources; such as from cash flows provided by financing activities (“Other Sources”), a component of which could include borrowings, whether collateralized by our properties or unsecured, or net sales proceeds from the sale of real estate. We have not established any limit on the extent to which we may use borrowings to pay distributions, and there is no assurance we will be able to sustain distributions at any level.  Refer to Item 5. “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities – Distributions” for additional information regarding our distributions.
Borrowings
 
We have borrowed funds to acquire properties, make loans and other permitted investments and to pay certain related fees. We may borrow money, whether collateralized by our assets or unsecured, to pay distributions to stockholders, for working capital and/or for other corporate purposes. We are subject to certain customary covenants and limitations in connection with our borrowings. The aggregate amount of long-term financing is not expected to exceed 60% of the carrying value of our total assets on an annual basis.
 
There is no limitation on the amount we may invest in any single property or other asset or on the amount we can borrow for the purchase of any individual property or other investment.  Our board of directors has adopted a policy to generally limit our aggregate borrowings to approximately 75% of the aggregate value of our assets, unless substantial justification exists that borrowing a greater amount is in our best interests. Our intent has been to target our aggregate borrowings ranging from 40% to 60% of the aggregate value of our assets now that we own a seasoned and stable asset portfolio.  As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had an aggregate debt leverage ratio of approximately 54.9% and 53.5%, respectively, of the aggregate carrying value of our assets.
 
Competition
 
The current market for healthcare real estate is highly competitive as is the leasing market for such properties. We compete for financing with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities, including individuals, corporations, bank and insurance company investment accounts, REITs, real estate limited partnerships, many of which will have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do. The level of competition impacts both our ability to manage our investments and locate suitable tenants.
 
Our tenants and operators compete with other properties that provide comparable services in their local markets.  Tenants and operators compete for patients, tenants and residents based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to: quality of care, reputation, location, service offerings, physician groups, staff and price. We also face competition from other properties for tenants or residents, such as physicians and other health care providers that provide comparable facilities and services.
 
Employees
 
We are externally managed and as such we do not have any employees.  
 
Financial Information about Industry Segments
 
We have determined that we operate in one business segment, real estate ownership, which consists of owning, managing, leasing, acquiring, developing, investing in, and as conditions warrant, disposing of real estate assets.  We internally evaluate all of our real estate assets as one operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report segment information.

Taxation 
 
The following summary of the taxation of the Company and the material federal income tax consequences to the holders of our equity securities is for general information only and is not tax advice. This summary does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to certain types of holders of securities (including, but not limited to, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, financial institutions or broker-dealers, persons holding our securities as part of a hedging, integrated conversion, or constructive sale transaction or a straddle, persons subject to special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the Code (as hereinafter defined), traders in securities that use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, investors in pass-through entities and foreign corporations and persons who are not citizens or residents of the U.S.).
 
This summary does not discuss all of the aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant in light of a particular investment or other circumstances. In addition, this summary does not discuss any state or local income taxation or foreign income taxation or other tax consequences. This summary is based on current U.S. federal income tax law. Subsequent developments in U.S. federal income tax law, including changes in law or differing interpretations, which may be applied retroactively, could have a material effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of our securities as set forth in this summary. 
 
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. President signed into law H.R. 1, the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” (“Tax Act”) which generally took effect for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and, in certain instances, is scheduled to expire for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2026.  
 
The Tax Act makes many changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws that significantly impact the taxation of individuals, corporations (both regular subchapter C corporations as well as corporations that have elected to be taxed as REITs), and the taxation of taxpayers with overseas assets and operations.  Among its changes, the Tax Act (1) temporarily reduces the top individual income tax rate to 37% (from 39.6%), (2) permanently replaces the progressive corporate tax rate structure with a flat corporate tax rate of 21%, (3) repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax, (4) generally limits net operating loss (“NOLs”) deductions to 80% of the taxable income in the carryforward year and eliminates the ability to carryback NOLs that arise in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017, and (5) generally limits the deduction for net business interest expense to 30% of “adjusted taxable income” with certain exceptions for electing real property trades or businesses.
 There are numerous interpretive issues and ambiguities that will require guidance and that are not clearly addressed in the conference report that accompanied the Tax Act. Technical corrections legislation will likely be needed to clarify certain of the new provisions and give proper effect to congressional intent. There can be no assurance, however, that technical corrections or other legislative changes that may be needed to prevent unintended or unforeseen tax consequences will be enacted by Congress anytime soon. Although this summary addresses material provisions enacted by the Tax Act, which may affect REITs and their stockholders, given the complexity of this new law, prospective stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding its potential impact on the U.S. federal income tax consequence to them in light of their particular circumstances.
 General.  We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Code”) beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012. We believe that, commencing with such taxable year, we have been organized and have operated in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 Qualification and taxation as a REIT has depended upon, and will continue to depend upon, our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual operating results, distribution levels, diversity of share ownership and various qualification requirements imposed upon REITs by the Code. Our ability to qualify as a REIT also requires that we satisfy certain asset tests (discussed below), some of which depend upon the fair market values of assets directly or indirectly owned by us. Such values may not be susceptible to a precise determination. While we intend to continue to operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a REIT, no assurance can be given that the actual results of our operations for any taxable year will satisfy such requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. 
 13


As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on that portion of our ordinary income or capital gain we distribute currently to our stockholders, because the REIT provisions of the Code generally allow a REIT to deduct distributions, which are taxable dividends, paid to its stockholders. This substantially eliminates the federal double taxation on earnings (taxation at both the corporate level and stockholder level) that usually results from an investment in a corporation. With limited exceptions, dividends from us or from other entities that are taxed as REITs are generally not eligible for the capital gain rate and will continue to be taxed at rates applicable to ordinary income.  Commencing with taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and continuing through 2025, the Tax Act temporarily reduces the effective tax rate on ordinary REIT dividends (i.e., dividends other than capital gain dividends and dividends attributable to certain qualified dividend income received by us) for U.S. stockholders (as hereinafter defined) of our common stock that are individuals, estates or trusts by permitting such stockholders to claim a deduction in determining their taxable income equal to 20% of any such dividends they receive. Taking into account the Tax Act’s reduction in the maximum individual federal income tax rate from 39.6% to 37%, this results in a maximum effective rate of regular income tax on ordinary REIT dividends of 29.6% through 2025 (as compared to the 20% maximum federal income tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income received from a non-REIT corporation).
 Any NOLs, foreign tax credits and other tax attributes generally do not pass through to our stockholders, subject to special rules for certain items such as the capital gains that we recognize. 
 As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 our domestic TRSs are subject to U.S. federal income tax on their taxable income at a rate of 21% (as well as applicable state and local income tax), but NOL carryforwards of TRS losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be deducted only to the extent of 80% of TRS taxable income in the carryforward year (computed without regard to the NOL deduction). In contrast to prior law, which permitted unused NOL carryforwards to be carried back two years and forward 20 years, the Tax Act provides that losses arising in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017 can no longer be carried back but can be carried forward indefinitely.
 Commencing in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, Section 163(j) of the Code, as amended by the Tax Act, limits the deductibility of net interest expense paid or accrued on debt properly allocable to a trade or business to 30% of “adjusted taxable income,” subject to certain exceptions. Any deduction in excess of the limitation is carried forward and may be used in a subsequent year, subject to the 30% limitation. “Adjusted taxable income” is determined without regard to certain deductions, including those for net interest expense, NOL carryforwards and, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2022, depreciation, amortization and depletion. Provided the taxpayer makes a timely election (which is irrevocable), the 30% limitation does not apply to a trade or business involving real property development, redevelopment, construction, reconstruction, rental, operation, acquisition, conversion, disposition, management, leasing or brokerage, within the meaning of Section 469(c)(7)(C) of the Code. If this election is made, depreciable real property (including certain improvements) held by the relevant trade or business must be depreciated under the alternative depreciation system (“ADS”) under the Code, which is generally less favorable than the generally applicable system of depreciation under the Code. In general, while there is no authority under such provision or in the legislative history of the Tax Act that specifically addresses healthcare properties or other facilities, including senior housing facilities and MOB, we believe that our leasing, management and operation of such facilities and buildings should constitute a real property trade or business, and we, or our TRSs, may elect not to have the interest deduction limitation apply to that trade or business. If we, or our TRSs, do not make the election or if the election is determined not to be available with respect to all or certain of our, or our TRSs, business activities, the new interest deduction limitation could result in us having more REIT taxable income and thus increase the amount of distributions we must make to comply with the REIT requirements and avoid incurring corporate level tax. Similarly, the limitation could cause our TRSs to have greater taxable income and thus potentially greater corporate tax liability.
 Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, however, we will be subject to federal income taxation as follows: 
  
• | We will be taxed at the regular corporate rate on our undistributed taxable income, including undistributed net capital gains.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If we have net gain for tax purposes from prohibited transactions (which are, in general, sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business), such gain will be subject to a 100% tax.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 14


 
• | If we elect to treat property that we acquire in connection with a foreclosure of a mortgage loan or certain leasehold terminations as “foreclosure property,” we may avoid the 100% tax on gain from a sale of that property (if the sale would otherwise constitute a prohibited transaction), but the income from the sale or operation of the property may be subject to corporate income tax at the highest applicable rate.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If we should fail to satisfy the asset test other than certain de minimis violations or other requirements applicable to REITs, as described below, yet nonetheless maintain our qualification as a REIT because there is reasonable cause for the failure and other applicable requirements are met, we may be subject to an excise tax. In that case, the amount of the tax will be at least $50,000 per failure, and, in the case of certain asset test failures, will be determined as the amount of net income generated by the assets in question multiplied by the highest corporate tax rate if that amount exceeds $50,000 per failure.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If we fail to satisfy either of the 75% or 95% income tests (discussed below) but have nonetheless maintained our qualification as a REIT because certain conditions have been met, we will be subject to a 100% tax on an amount based on the magnitude of the failure, as adjusted to reflect the profit margin associated with our gross income.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If we fail to distribute during each year at least the sum of (i) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for the year, (ii) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year, and (iii) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, then we will be subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of (A) the amounts actually distributed, plus (B) retained amounts on which corporate level tax is paid by us.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We may elect to retain and pay tax on our net long-term capital gains. In that case, a U.S. stockholder would be taxed on its proportionate share of our undistributed long-term capital gains and would receive a credit or refund for its proportionate share of the tax we paid.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If we acquire appreciated assets from a C corporation that is not a REIT (i.e., a corporation generally subject to corporate level tax) in a transaction in which the C corporation would not normally be required to recognize any gain or loss on disposition of the asset and we subsequently recognize gain on the disposition of the asset during the five-year period beginning on the date on which we acquired the asset, then a portion of the gain may be subject to tax at the regular corporate rate, unless the C corporation made an election to treat the asset as if it were sold for its fair market value at the time of our acquisition. We will also be required to distribute prior non-REIT earnings and profits (“E&P”).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We may be required to pay monetary penalties to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) in certain circumstances, including if we fail to meet record keeping requirements intended to monitor our compliance with rules relating to the composition of a REIT’s stockholders.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The earnings of our TRSs are subject to federal corporate income tax. In addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on the REIT and a corporate level tax on the TRS for transactions between a TRS and the REIT that are deemed not to be conducted on an arm’s length basis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, we and our subsidiaries may be subject to a variety of taxes, including payroll taxes and state, local, foreign, property and other taxes, on our assets and operations. We could also be subject to tax in situations and on transactions not presently contemplated. 
 Requirements for Qualification as a REIT.  Our qualification as a REIT has depended upon and will continue to depend upon our meeting and continuing to meet the requirements discussed below relating to our organization, sources of income, nature of assets and distributions of income to our stockholders. 
 15


Organizational Requirements.  In order to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code we must meet tests regarding our income and assets described below and we must (i) be a corporation, trust or association that would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for the REIT provisions of the Code; (ii) be managed by one or more trustees or directors; (iii) have our beneficial ownership evidenced by transferable shares; (iv) not be a financial institution or an insurance company subject to special provisions of the federal income tax laws; (v) use a calendar year for federal income tax purposes; (vi) have at least 100 stockholders for at least 335 days of each taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months; and (vii) not be closely held, as defined for purposes of the REIT provisions of the Code. 
 We would be treated as closely held if, during the last half of any taxable year, more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital shares is owned, directly or indirectly through the application of certain attribution rules, by five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Code to include certain entities. Items (vi) and (vii) above do not apply until after the first taxable year for which we elect to be taxed as a REIT. If we comply with U.S. Department of Treasury regulations (“Treasury Regulations”) that provide procedures for ascertaining the actual ownership of our common stock for each taxable year and we did not know, and with the exercise of reasonable diligence could not have known, that we failed to meet item (vii) above for a taxable year, we will be treated as having met item (vii) for that year. 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012, and we intend to satisfy the other requirements described in items (i) through (v) above at all times during each of our taxable years. In addition, our charter contains restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares of our common stock that are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements in items (vi) and (vii) above. 
 For purposes of the requirements described herein, any corporation that is a qualified REIT subsidiary of ours will not be treated as a corporation separate from us and all assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit of our qualified REIT subsidiaries will be treated as our assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit. A qualified REIT subsidiary is a corporation, other than a TRS (described below under “— Operational Requirements — Asset Tests”), of which all of its capital shares are owned by a REIT. 
 In the case of a REIT that is a partner in an entity treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes, the REIT is treated as owning its proportionate share, based on its capital interest, of the assets of the partnership and as earning its allocable share of the gross income of the partnership for purposes of the requirements described herein. In addition, the character of the assets and gross income of the partnership will retain the same character in the hands of the REIT for purposes of the REIT requirements, including the asset and income tests described below. As a result, our proportionate share, based on our capital interest, of the assets, liabilities and items of income of our operating partnership and of any other partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or other entity treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes in which we or the operating partnership have an interest, will be treated as our assets, liabilities and items of income. 
 The Code provides relief from violations of the REIT gross income requirements, as described below under “— Operational Requirements — Gross Income Tests,” in cases where a violation is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, and other requirements are met, including the payment of a penalty tax that is based upon the magnitude of the violation. In addition, the Code includes provisions that extend similar relief in the case of certain violations of the REIT asset requirements (see “— Operational Requirements — Asset Tests” below) and other REIT requirements, again provided that the violation is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, and other conditions are met, including the payment of a penalty tax. If we fail to satisfy any of the various REIT requirements, there can be no assurance that these relief provisions would be available to enable us to maintain our qualification as a REIT. If relief provisions are available, the amount of any resultant penalty tax could be substantial. 
 16


Operational Requirements — Gross Income Tests.  To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must satisfy annually two gross income requirements: 
  
• | At least 75% of our gross income, excluding gross income from prohibited transactions, for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property and from other specified sources, including qualified temporary investment income, as described below. Gross income includes “rents from real property” (as defined in the Code) and, in some circumstances, interest, but excludes gross income from dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. These dispositions are referred to as “prohibited transactions.” This is the “75% Income Test.”
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | At least 95% of our gross income, excluding gross income from prohibited transactions, for each taxable year must be derived from the real property investments described above and generally from dividends and interest and gains from the sale or disposition of shares of common stock or securities or from any combination of the foregoing. This is the “95% Income Test.”
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The rents we will receive or be deemed to receive will qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income requirements for a REIT only if the following conditions are met: 
  
• | The amount of rent received from a tenant must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any Person; however, an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term “rents from real property” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of gross receipts or sales.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In general, neither we nor an owner of 10% or more shares of our common stock may directly or constructively own 10% or more of a tenant, which we refer to as a “Related Party Tenant,” or a subtenant of the tenant (in which case only rent attributable to the subtenant is disqualified).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property cannot be greater than 15% of the total rent received under the lease, as determined based on the average of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of the taxable year.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We normally must not operate or manage the property or furnish or render services to tenants, other than through an “independent contractor” (as defined in the Code) who is adequately compensated and from whom we do not derive any income or through a TRS (discussed below). However, a REIT may provide services with respect to its properties, and the income derived therefrom will qualify as “rents from real property” if the services are “usually or customarily rendered” (as defined in the Code) in connection with the rental of space only and are not otherwise considered “rendered to the occupant” (as defined in the Code). Even if the services provided by us with respect to a property are impermissible customer services, the income derived therefrom will qualify as “rents from real property” if such income does not exceed 1% of all amounts received or accrued with respect to that property.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Interest income constitutes qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the 75% Income Test to the extent that the obligation upon which such interest is paid is secured by a mortgage on real property. If we receive interest income with respect to a mortgage loan that is secured by both real property and other property, and the highest principal amount of the loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property on the date that we acquired or originated the mortgage loan, the interest income will be apportioned between the real property and the other collateral, and our income from the arrangement will qualify for purposes of the 75% income test only to the extent that the interest is allocable to the real property. Even if a loan is not secured by real property, or is under-secured, the income that it generates may nonetheless qualify for purposes of the 95% Income Test. 
 17


To the extent the terms of a loan provide for contingent interest that is based on the cash proceeds realized upon the sale of the property securing the loan (“Shared Appreciation Provision”), income attributable to the participation feature will be treated as gain from sale of the underlying property, which generally will be qualifying income for purposes of both the 75% Income Test and 95% Income Test, provided that the real property is not held as inventory or dealer property or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Similar to the treatment of contingent rents from real property (discussed above), to the extent that we derive interest income from a mortgage loan where all or a portion of the amount of interest or rental income payable is contingent, such income generally will qualify for purposes of the 75% Income Test and 95% Income Test only if it is based upon the gross receipts or sales and not on the net income or profits of the borrower. 
 We may invest in mezzanine loans, which are loans secured by equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns real property, rather than by a direct mortgage of the real property. The IRS has issued Revenue Procedure 2003-65, which provides a safe harbor applicable to mezzanine loans. Under the Revenue Procedure, if a mezzanine loan meets each of the requirements contained in the Revenue Procedure, (i) the mezzanine loan will be treated by the IRS as a real estate asset for purposes of the Asset Tests described below, and (ii) interest derived from the mezzanine loan will be treated as qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the 75% Income Test. Although the Revenue Procedure provides a safe harbor on which taxpayers may rely, it does not prescribe rules of substantive tax law. We intend to structure any investments in mezzanine loans or similar products in a manner that generally complies with the various requirements applicable to our qualification as a REIT. Certain of our mezzanine loans may qualify under the safe harbor set forth in the Revenue Procedure. However, we may make or acquire some mezzanine loans that do not qualify for the safe harbor. To the extent that any of our mezzanine loans do not meet all of the requirements for reliance on the safe harbor set forth in the Revenue Procedure, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the tax treatment of these loans. 
 We may, from time to time, enter into hedging transactions with respect to interest rate exposure or currency fluctuation on one or more of our assets or liabilities. Any such hedging transactions could take a variety of forms, including the use of derivative instruments such as interest rate swap contracts, interest rate cap or floor contracts, futures or forward contracts, and options. To the extent that we or a pass-through subsidiary enters into a hedging transaction (i) to reduce interest rate risk on indebtedness incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets, (ii) to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income that would qualify under the 75% Income Test or the 95% Income Test, or (iii) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, new hedging transactions entered into to hedge the income or loss from prior hedging transactions, where the property or indebtedness which was the subject of the prior hedging transaction was extinguished or disposed of, and the instrument is properly identified as a hedge along with the risk it hedges within prescribed time periods, any periodic income from the instrument, or gain from the disposition of such instrument, would be excluded altogether from the 95% Income Test or the 75% Income Test. 
 To the extent that we hedge in certain other situations, the resultant income will be treated as income that does not qualify under the 75% Income Test or the 95% Income Test, provided that certain requirements are met. We intend to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our status as a REIT. We may conduct some or all of our hedging activities through a TRS or other corporate entity, the income from which may be subject to federal, state, and/or international income tax, rather than by participating in the arrangements directly or through pass-through subsidiaries. No assurance can be given, however, that our hedging activities will not give rise to income that does not qualify for purposes of either or both of the REIT income tests, or that our hedging activities will not adversely affect our ability to satisfy the REIT qualification requirements. 
 Prior to the making of investments in real properties, we may invest the Net Offering Proceeds in liquid assets such as government securities or certificates of deposit. For purposes of the 75% Income Test, income attributable to a stock or debt instrument purchased with the proceeds received by a REIT in exchange for stock in the REIT (other than amounts received pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan (“Reinvestment Plan”) constitutes qualified temporary investment income if such income is received or accrued during the one-year period beginning on the date the REIT receives such new capital. To the extent we hold any proceeds of the offering for longer than one year, we may invest those amounts in less liquid investments such as mortgage-backed securities, maturing mortgage loans purchased from mortgage lenders or shares of common stock in other REITs in order to satisfy the 75% Income Test and the 95% Income Test and the Asset Tests described below. We expect the bulk of the remainder of our income to qualify under the 75% Income and 95% Income Tests as rents from real property, gains from the sale of real property interests and interest on mortgages on real property in accordance with the requirements described above. 
 18


With regard to rental income, we anticipate most of our leases will be for fixed rentals with annual CPI or similar adjustments and that none of the rentals under our leases will be based on the income or profits of any Person. Rental leases may provide for payments based on gross receipts, which are generally permissible under the REIT income tests. In addition, none of our tenants are expected to be “Related Party Tenants” and the portion of the rent attributable to personal property is not expected to exceed 15% of the total rent to be received under any lease. We anticipate that all or most of the services to be performed with respect to our real properties will be performed by our property manager, and such services are expected to be those usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not rendered to the occupant of such real property. Finally, we anticipate any non-customary services will be provided by a TRS or, alternatively, by an independent contractor that is adequately compensated and from whom we derive no income. However, we can give no assurance that the actual sources of our gross income will allow us to satisfy the 75% Income Test and the 95% Income Test described above. 
 Further, we and our subsidiaries may hold investments in, and pay taxes to, foreign countries. Taxes that we pay in foreign jurisdictions may not be passed through to, or used by, our stockholders or us as a foreign tax credit or otherwise. Our foreign investments might also generate foreign currency gains and losses. Foreign currency gains that we derive from certain of our investments will be excluded for purposes of computing the REIT income tests if such foreign currency gain is “real estate foreign exchange gain” (as defined in the Code), that is, if such gains are attributable to any item of income that itself qualifies for purposes of the 75% Income Test or other specified sources. Other foreign currency gains, however, if such foreign currency gain is “passive foreign exchange gain” (as defined in the Code), will be excluded for purposes of computing the 95% Income Test but will be treated as income that does not qualify under the 75% Income Test. Generally, “passive foreign exchange gain” includes foreign exchange gain attributable to any item of income that itself qualifies for purposes of the 95% Income Test or other specified sources. 
 The Tax Act made fundamental changes to the U.S. international tax system that could affect the amount, timing or character of income we recognize with respect to any foreign subsidiary and, thus, may impact our decision to make investments in foreign jurisdictions. For example, if we were to form a foreign subsidiary, we would be subject to new rules enacted under the Tax Act which could subject us to current U.S. federal income tax on a portion of our income attributable to such foreign subsidiary.
 Notwithstanding our failure to satisfy one or both of the 75% Income and the 95% Income Tests for any taxable year, we may still qualify as a REIT for that year if we are eligible for relief under specific provisions of the Code. These relief provisions generally will be available if: 
  
• | our failure to meet these tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | following our identification of the failure, we file a schedule with a description of each item of gross income that caused the failure in accordance with Treasury Regulations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 It is not possible, however, to state whether, in all circumstances, we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions. In addition, as discussed above, even if these relief provisions apply, a tax would be imposed with respect to the excess net income. 
 Operational Requirements — Prohibited Transactions.  A “prohibited transaction” is a sale by a REIT of real property or other assets held primarily for sale in the ordinary course of the REIT’s trade or business (i.e., real property or other assets that are not held for investment but are held as inventory for sale by the REIT). A 100% penalty tax is imposed on any gain realized by a REIT from a prohibited transaction (including our distributive share of any such gain realized by our operating partnership). Under existing law, whether property is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. We do not presently intend to acquire or hold or allow the operating partnership to acquire or hold any property that represents inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our or the operating partnership’s trade or business. 
 19


A safe harbor to the characterization of the sale of property by a REIT as a prohibited transaction and the 100% prohibited transaction tax is available if the following requirements are met:  
  
• | the REIT has held the property for not less than two years;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | the aggregate expenditures made by the REIT, or any partner of the REIT, during the two-year period preceding the date of the sale that are includable in the basis of the property do not exceed 30% of the net selling price of the property;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | either (i) during the year in question, the REIT did not make more than seven sales of property other than foreclosure property or Section 1031 like-kind exchanges, or (ii) the aggregate adjusted bases of the non-foreclosure property sold by the REIT during the year did not exceed 20% of the aggregate bases of all of the assets of the REIT at the beginning of such year, or (iii) the fair market value of the non-foreclosure property sold by the REIT during the year did not exceed 20% of the fair market value of all the assets of the REIT at the beginning of such year (10% for both aggregate basis and fair market value determinations beginning with taxable years beginning before December 18, 2015);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the REIT has held the property for at least two years for the production of rental income; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if the REIT has made more than seven sales of non-foreclosure property during the year, substantially all of the marketing and development expenditures with respect to the property were made through an independent contractor from whom the REIT derives no income.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For purposes of the limitation on the number of sales that a REIT may complete in any given year, the sale of more than one property to one buyer will be treated as one sale. Moreover, if a REIT obtains replacement property pursuant to a Section 1031 like-kind exchange, then it will be entitled to tack the holding period it has in the relinquished property for purposes of the two-year holding period requirement. Under the Tax Act, generally effective for exchanges completed after December 31, 2017, the rule providing for nonrecognition of gain in the case of like-kind exchanges is limited to exchanges of real property only, and not to tangible personal property or intangible property.
 The failure of a sale to fall within the safe harbor does not alone cause such sale to be a prohibited transaction and subject to the 100% prohibited transaction tax. In that event, the particular facts and circumstances of the transaction must be analyzed to determine whether it is a prohibited transaction. 
 Operational Requirements — Asset Tests.  At the close of each quarter of our taxable year, starting with the taxable year ending December 31, 2012 (i.e., starting with the quarter ending March 31, 2012), we also must satisfy four tests, which we refer to as “Asset Tests,” relating to the nature and diversification of our assets.  

• | First, at least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets, cash, cash items and government securities. The term “real estate assets” includes real property, mortgages on real property, shares of common stock in other qualified U.S. REITs, property attributable to the temporary investment of new capital as described above and a proportionate share of any real estate assets owned by a partnership in which we are a partner (for example, our operating partnership) or of any qualified REIT subsidiary of ours. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, the term “real estate assets” also includes debt instruments of publicly offered REITs, personal property securing a mortgage secured by both real property and personal property if the fair market value of such personal property does not exceed 15% of the total fair market value of all such property, and personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property for which the rent attributable to personal property is not greater than 15% of the total rent received under the lease.

• | Second, no more than 25% of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the 75% asset class.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 20


 
• | Third, of the investments included in the 25% asset class, the value of any one issuer’s securities that we own may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets. Additionally, we may not own more than 10% of the voting power or value of any one issuer’s outstanding securities, which we refer to as the “10% Asset Test.” The 10% Asset Test does not apply to securities of a TRS, nor does it apply to certain “straight debt” (as defined in the Code) instruments possessing certain characteristics. The term “securities” also does not include the equity or debt securities of a qualified REIT subsidiary of ours or an equity interest in any entity treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fourth, no more than 20% (25% for our taxable years beginning before December 31, 2017) of the value of our total assets may consist of the securities of one or more TRSs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fifth, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be represented by debt instruments of publicly offered REITs to the extent those debt instruments would not be real estate assets but for the inclusion of debt instruments of publicly offered REITs in the meaning of real estate assets effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, as described above.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Any interests we hold in a real estate mortgage investment conduit (“REMIC”) will generally qualify as real estate assets and income derived from REMIC interests will generally be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the REIT income tests described above. If less than 95% of the assets of a REMIC are real estate assets, however, then only a proportionate part of our interest in the REMIC and income derived from the interest will qualify for purposes of the REIT asset and income tests. If we hold a “residual interest” (as defined in the Code) in a REMIC from which we derive “excess inclusion income” (as defined in the Code), we will be required either to distribute the excess inclusion income or to pay tax on it (or a combination of the two), even though we may not receive the income in cash. To the extent that distributed excess inclusion income is allocable to a particular stockholder, the income (i) would not be allowed to be offset by any NOLs otherwise available to the stockholder, (ii) would be subject to tax as unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”) in the hands of most types of stockholders that are otherwise generally exempt from federal income tax, and (iii) would result in the application of U.S. federal income tax withholding at the maximum rate without reduction pursuant to any otherwise applicable income tax treaty, to the extent allocable to most types of foreign stockholders. Moreover, any excess inclusion income that we receive that is allocable to specified categories of tax-exempt investors which are not subject to unrelated business income tax, such as government entities, may be subject to corporate-level income tax in our hands, whether or not it is distributed. 
 To the extent we hold mortgage participations or commercial mortgage-backed securities that do not represent REMIC interests, such assets may not qualify as real estate assets, and the income generated from them may not qualify for purposes of either or both of the REIT income tests, depending upon the circumstances and the specific structure of the investment. 
 We may enter into sale and repurchase agreements under which we would nominally sell certain of our loan assets to a counterparty and simultaneously enter into an agreement to repurchase the sold assets. We believe that we would be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the owner of the loan assets that are the subject of any such agreement notwithstanding that such agreements may transfer record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert that we did not own the loan assets during the term of the sale and repurchase agreement, in which case we could fail to qualify as a REIT. 
 Certain of our mezzanine loans which may qualify for the safe harbor in Revenue Procedure 2003-65 pursuant to which certain loans secured by a first priority security interest in ownership interests in a partnership or limited liability company will be treated as qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% real estate asset test and the 10% vote or value test. See “— Operational Requirements — Gross Income Tests.” We may make some mezzanine loans that do not qualify for that safe harbor and that do not qualify as “straight debt” securities or for one of the other exclusions from the definition of “securities” for purposes of the 10% value test. We intend to make such investments in such a manner as not to fail the asset tests described above. 
 21


Independent appraisals are not necessarily obtained by us to support our conclusions as to the value of our total assets or the value of any particular security or securities for purposes of these operational requirements. Moreover, values of some assets, including instruments issued in securitization transactions, may not be susceptible to a precise determination, and values are subject to change in the future. Furthermore, the proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances, which could affect the application of the REIT asset requirements. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not contend that our interests in our subsidiaries or in the securities of other issuers will not cause a violation of the REIT asset tests. 
 The Asset Tests must generally be met for each quarter. Upon full investment of the Net Offering Proceeds, we expect most of our assets will consist of “real estate assets” and we therefore expect to satisfy the Asset Tests. 
 If we meet the Asset Tests at the close of any quarter, we maintain our qualification as a REIT despite a failure to satisfy the Asset Tests at the end of a later quarter in which we have not acquired any securities or other property if such failure occurs solely because of changes in asset values. If our failure to satisfy the Asset Tests results from an acquisition of securities or other property during a quarter, we can cure the failure by disposing of a sufficient amount of non-qualifying assets within 30 days after the close of that quarter. We intend to maintain adequate records of the value of our assets to ensure compliance with the Asset Tests and to take other action within 30 days after the close of any quarter as may be required to cure any noncompliance. If that does not occur, we may nonetheless qualify for one of the relief provisions described below. 
 The Code contains a number of provisions applicable to REITs, including relief provisions that allow REITs to satisfy the asset requirements, or to maintain REIT qualification notwithstanding certain violations of the asset and other requirements. 
 One such provision allows a REIT which fails one or more of the asset requirements to nevertheless maintain its REIT qualification if (i) it provides the IRS with a description of each asset causing the failure; (ii) the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect; (iii) the REIT pays a tax equal to the greater of (A) $50,000 per failure; or (B) the product of the net income generated by the assets that caused the failure multiplied by the highest applicable corporate tax rate; and (iv) the REIT either disposes of the assets causing the failure within six months after the last day of the quarter in which it identifies the failure, or otherwise satisfies the relevant asset tests within that time frame. 
 A second relief provision applies to de minimis violations of the 10% and 5% asset tests. A REIT may maintain its qualification despite a violation of such requirements if (i) the value of the assets causing the violation do not exceed the lesser of 1% of the REIT’s total assets and $10,000,000, or (ii) the REIT either disposes of the assets causing the failure within six months after the last day of the quarter in which it identifies the failure, or the relevant tests are otherwise satisfied within that time frame. 
 The Code also provides that certain securities will not cause a violation of the 10% value test described above. Such securities include instruments that constitute “straight debt,” which includes securities having certain contingency features. A security cannot qualify as “straight debt” if a REIT (or a controlled TRS) owns other securities in the issuer of that security which do not qualify as straight debt, unless the value of those other securities constitutes, in the aggregate, 1% or less of the total value of that issuer’s outstanding securities. In addition to straight debt, the Code provides that certain other securities will not violate the 10% value test. Such securities include:  
  
• | any loan made to an individual or an estate;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | certain rental agreements in which one or more payments are to be made in subsequent years (other than agreements between a REIT and certain Persons related to the REIT);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any obligation to pay rents from real property;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | securities issued by governmental entities that are not dependent in whole or in part on the profits of (or payments made by) a non-governmental entity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any security issued by another REIT; and
--+-----------------------------------------


• | any debt instrument issued by a partnership if the partnership’s income is of a nature that it would satisfy the 75% gross income test described above under “— Operational Requirements — Gross Income Tests.”
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 22


In addition, when applying the 10% value test, a debt security issued by a partnership is not taken into account to the extent, if any, of the REIT’s proportionate equity interest in that partnership. 
 Operational Requirements — Annual Distribution Requirement.  In order to be taxed as a REIT, we are required to make cash or taxable property distributions, other than capital gain distributions, to our stockholders each year in the amount of at least 90% of our taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and subject to certain other potential adjustments) for all tax years. While we must generally make distributions in the taxable year to which they relate, we may also make distributions in the following taxable year if (i) they are declared before we timely file our federal income tax return for the taxable year in question and (ii) they are paid on or before the first regular distribution payment date after the declaration. 
 Even if we satisfy the foregoing distribution requirement and, accordingly, continue to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, we will still be subject to federal income tax on the excess of our net capital gain and our REIT taxable income, as adjusted, over the amount of distributions to stockholders. 
 In addition, if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of: 
  
• | 85% of our ordinary income for that year;
--+------------------------------------------


• | 95% of our capital gain net income other than the capital gain net income which we elect to retain and pay tax on for that year; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any undistributed taxable income from prior periods,
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 then we will be subject to a 4% non-deductible excise tax on the excess of the amount of the required distributions over the sum of (i) the amounts actually distributed plus (ii) retained amounts on which corporate level tax is paid by us. 
 We intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy this requirement; however, it is possible we may experience timing differences between (i) the actual receipt of income and payment of deductible expenses, and (ii) the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses for purposes of computing our taxable income. Further, under changes made by the Tax Act, income generally must be accrued for U.S. federal income tax purposes no later than the taxable year in which such income is take into account as revenue in our financial statements, which could create a mismatch between our taxable income and the actual receipt of cash attributable to such income. It is also possible we may be allocated a share of net capital gain attributable to the sale of depreciated property by the operating partnership, or any other partnership in which we own an interest, that exceeds our allocable share of cash attributable to that sale. In those circumstances, we may have less cash than is necessary to meet our annual distribution requirement or to avoid income or excise taxation on undistributed income. 
 We may find it necessary in those circumstances to arrange for financing, raise funds through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or to make a taxable stock distribution in order to meet our distribution requirements. If we fail to satisfy the distribution requirement for any taxable year by reason of a later adjustment to our taxable income made by the IRS, we may be able to pay “deficiency dividends” (as defined in the Code) in a later year and include such distributions in our deductions for dividends paid for the earlier year. In that event, we may be able to avoid the disqualification of our REIT status or being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends, but we would be required to pay interest and a penalty to the IRS based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividends for the earlier year. 
 As noted above, we may also elect to retain, rather than distribute, some or all of our net long-term capital gains. The effect of such an election would be as follows: 
  
• | We would be required to pay the federal income tax on the undistributed gains;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Taxable U.S. stockholders, while required to include their proportionate share of the undistributed long-term capital gains in income, would receive a credit or refund for their share of the tax paid by the REIT; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The basis of the stockholder’s shares of our common stock would be increased by the difference between the designated amount included in the stockholder’s long-term capital gains and the tax deemed paid with respect to such shares of common stock.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 23


In computing our taxable income, we will use the accrual method of accounting and intend to depreciate depreciable property under the ADS. We are required to file an annual federal income tax return, which, like other corporate returns, is subject to examination by the IRS. Because the tax law requires us to make many judgments regarding the proper treatment of a transaction or an item of income or deduction, it is possible that the IRS will challenge positions we take in computing our taxable income and our distributions. 
 Challenges could arise, for example, with respect to the allocation of the purchase price of real properties between depreciable or amortizable assets and non-depreciable or non-amortizable assets such as land and the current deductibility of fees paid to our Advisor or its affiliates. If the IRS were to successfully challenge our characterization of a transaction or determination of our taxable income, we could be found to have failed to satisfy a requirement for qualification as a REIT. If we are determined to have failed to satisfy the distribution requirements for a taxable year, we would be disqualified as a REIT, unless we were permitted to pay a deficiency dividend to our stockholders and pay interest thereon to the IRS, as provided by the Code. 
 Operational Requirement — Recordkeeping.  We must maintain certain records as set forth in Treasury Regulations in order to avoid the payment of monetary penalties to the IRS. Such Treasury Regulations require that we request, on an annual basis, certain information designed to disclose the ownership of shares of our outstanding common stock. We intend to comply with these requirements. See “— Statement of Share Ownership” below. 
 Taxable REIT Subsidiaries.  A TRS is any corporation in which a REIT directly or indirectly owns stock, provided that the REIT and that corporation make a joint election to treat the corporation as a TRS. The election can be revoked at any time as long as the REIT and the TRS revoke such election jointly. In addition, if a TRS holds, directly or indirectly, more than 35% of the securities of any other corporation (by vote or by value), then that other corporation also is treated as a TRS. A corporation can be a TRS with respect to more than one REIT. We may form one or more TRSs for the purpose of owning and selling properties that do not meet the requirements of the “prohibited transactions” safe harbor. See “— Requirements for Qualification as a REIT — Operational Requirements — Prohibited Transactions” above. 
 To the extent of its taxable income, a TRS is subject to federal income tax at the regular corporate rate and also may be subject to state and local taxation. Any distributions paid or deemed paid by any one of our TRSs also will be subject to tax, either (i) to us if we do not pay the distributions received to our stockholders as distributions, or (ii) to our stockholders if we do pay out the distributions received to our stockholders. Further, the rules impose a 100% excise tax on transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT or to the REIT’s tenants that are not conducted on an arm’s-length basis. We may hold more than 10% of the stock of a TRS without jeopardizing our qualification as a REIT notwithstanding the rule described above under “— Requirements for Qualification as a REIT — Operational Requirements — Asset Tests” that generally precludes ownership of more than 10% (by vote or value) of any issuer’s securities. 
 However, as noted below, in order for us to qualify as a REIT, the non-mortgage securities (both debt and equity) of all of the TRSs in which we have invested either directly or indirectly may not represent more than 20% (25% for our taxable years beginning before December 31, 2017) of the total value of our assets. We expect that the aggregate value of all of our interests in TRSs will represent less than 25% of the total value of our assets. We cannot, however, assure you that we will always satisfy the 25% value limit or that the IRS will agree with the value we assign to our TRSs. 
 24


We may engage in activities indirectly through a TRS as necessary or convenient to avoid receiving the benefit of income or services that would jeopardize our REIT status if we engaged in the activities directly. In particular, in addition to the ownership of certain of our properties as noted above, we would likely use TRSs for providing services that are non-customary or that might produce income that does not qualify under the gross income tests described above. We may also use TRSs to satisfy various lending requirements with respect to special-purpose bankruptcy-remote entities. 
 Finally, while a REIT is generally limited in its ability to earn rents that qualify as “rents from real property” from a related party as defined by the Code, a REIT can earn “rents from real property” from the lease of a qualified healthcare property or qualified lodging facility to a TRS (even a wholly owned TRS) if an eligible independent contractor operates the facility. Generally, a qualified healthcare property means a property which is a healthcare facility or is necessary or incidental to the use of a healthcare facility. A qualified healthcare facility is defined as a hospital, nursing facility, assisted living facility, congregate care facility, qualified continuing care facility or other licensed facility which extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients operated by a provider of such services which was eligible for participation in the Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act with respect to such facility. Qualified lodging facilities are defined as hotels, motels or other establishments where more than half of the dwelling units are used on a transient basis, provided that legally authorized wagering or gambling activities are not conducted at or in connection with such facilities. Also included in the definition are the qualified lodging facility’s customary amenities and facilities. For these purposes, a contractor qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor” if it is less than 35% affiliated with the REIT and, at the time the contractor enters into the agreement with the TRS to operate the qualified healthcare property or qualified lodging facility, that contractor or any Person related to that contractor is actively engaged in the trade or business of operating qualified healthcare properties or qualified lodging facilities, respectively, for Persons unrelated to the TRS or its affiliated REIT. For these purposes, an otherwise eligible independent contractor is not disqualified from that status on account of the TRS bearing the expenses for the operation of the qualified healthcare property or qualified lodging facility, the TRS receiving the revenues from the operation of the qualified healthcare property or qualified lodging facility, net of expenses for that operation and fees payable to the eligible independent contractor, or the REIT receiving income from the eligible independent contractor pursuant to a preexisting or otherwise grandfathered lease of another property. 
 Failure to Qualify as a REIT.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT for any reason in a taxable year and applicable relief provisions do not apply, then we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at the regular corporate rate. We will not be able to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of current or accumulated E&P. In this event, stockholders taxed as individuals will be taxed on these dividends at the preferential income tax rates currently in effect for qualified dividends received from taxable C corporations and corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends received deduction. We also will be disqualified for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions. It is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to this statutory relief. 
 Sale-Leaseback Transactions.  We normally intend to treat our property leases as true leases for federal income tax purposes. However, depending on the terms of any specific transaction, the IRS might take the position that the transaction is not a true lease but is more properly treated in some other manner. If such re-characterization were successful, we would not be entitled to claim the depreciation deductions available to an owner of the property. In addition, the re-characterization of one or more of these transactions might cause us to fail to satisfy the Asset Tests or the Income Tests described above based upon the asset we would be treated as holding or the income we would be treated as having earned and such failure could result in our failing to qualify as a REIT. 
 Alternatively, the amount or timing of income inclusion or the loss of depreciation deductions resulting from the re-characterization might cause us to fail to meet the distribution requirement described above for one or more taxable years absent the availability of the deficiency dividend procedure or might result in a larger portion of our dividends being treated as ordinary income to our stockholders. 
 Taxation of Taxable U.S. Stockholders 
 Definition.  In this section, the phrase “U.S. stockholder” means a holder of our common stock that for federal income tax purposes is: 
 25


 
• | a citizen or resident of the U.S.;
--+-----------------------------------


• | a corporation, partnership or other entity treated as a corporation or partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the U.S. or of any political subdivision thereof;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a trust, if a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. Persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If a partnership, including for this purpose any entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. An investor that is a partnership and the partners in such partnership should consult their tax advisors about the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our common stock. 
 For any taxable year for which we qualify for taxation as a REIT, amounts distributed to, and gains realized by, taxable U.S. stockholders with respect to our common stock generally will be taxed as described below. For a summary of the federal income tax treatment of distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock pursuant to our Reinvestment Plan, see “Summary of Our Reinvestment Plan.” 
 Distributions Generally.  Distributions paid to U.S. stockholders, other than capital gain distributions discussed below, made out of our current or accumulated E&P and will be taxable to the stockholders as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes. These distributions are not eligible for the dividends received deduction generally available to corporations. In addition, with limited exceptions, these distributions are not eligible for taxation at the preferential income tax rates currently in effect for qualified dividends received by U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates from taxable C corporations. However, under the Tax Act, non-corporate stockholders may generally deduct 20% of the aggregate amount of ordinary REIT dividends distributed by us (other than “capital gain dividends” or “qualified dividend income”) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, thereby reducing the maximum effective tax rate applicable to REIT ordinary dividends to 29.6% (assuming the new maximum individual income tax rate of 37% applies). Stockholders that are individuals, trusts or estates however, may be taxed at the preferential rates currently in effect (assuming the relevant holding periods have been met) on dividends designated by and received from us to the extent that the dividends are attributable to (i) income retained by us in the prior taxable year on which we were subject to corporate level income tax (less the amount of tax), (ii) dividends received by us from taxable C corporations, including any dividends we may receive from a TRS, or (iii) income in the prior taxable year from the sales of “built-in gain” property acquired by us from C corporations in carryover basis transactions (less the amount of corporate tax on such income). 
 To the extent we make a distribution in excess of our current and accumulated E&P, the distribution will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital, reducing the tax basis in a U.S. stockholder’s shares of common stock, and the amount of each distribution in excess of a U.S. stockholder’s tax basis in its shares of common stock will be taxable as gain realized from the sale of its shares of common stock. Dividends we declare in October, November or December of any year payable to a stockholder of record on a specified date in any of these months will be treated as both paid by us and received by the stockholder on December 31 of the year, provided that we actually pay the dividends during January of the following calendar year. 
 To the extent we have available NOLs (after application of the 80% limitation enacted under the Tax Act as described above) and capital losses carried forward from prior tax years, such losses may reduce the amount of distributions we must make in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements. See “— Requirements for Qualification as a REIT — Operational Requirements — Annual Distribution Requirement.” Such losses, however, are not passed through to stockholders and do not offset income of stockholders from other sources, nor would such losses affect the character of any distributions that we make, which are generally subject to tax in the hands of stockholders to the extent that we have current or accumulated E&P. 
 26


If excess inclusion income from a taxable mortgage pool or REMIC residual interest is allocated to any stockholder, that income will be taxable in the hands of the stockholder and would not be offset by any NOLs of the stockholder that would otherwise be available. As required by IRS guidance, we intend to notify our stockholders if a portion of a dividend paid by us is attributable to excess inclusion income. 
 We will be treated as having sufficient E&P to treat as a dividend any distribution by us up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax discussed above. Moreover, any “deficiency distribution” will be treated as an ordinary or capital gain distribution, as the case may be, regardless of our E&P. As a result, stockholders may be required to treat as taxable some distributions that would otherwise result in a tax-free return of capital. 
 Distributions to U.S. stockholders that we properly designate as capital gain distributions normally will be treated as long-term capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which the U.S. stockholder has held his or her shares of common stock and, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, may not exceed our distributions paid for the taxable year, including distributions paid the following year that are treated as paid in the current year. A corporate U.S. stockholder might be required to treat up to 20% of some capital gain distributions as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains are generally taxable at preferential rates in the case of stockholders who are individuals, estates, and trusts. Capital gains attributable to the sale of depreciable real property held for more than 12 months are subject to a 25% maximum federal income tax rate for taxpayers who are individuals, to the extent of previously claimed depreciation deductions (unrecaptured Section 1250 gains). See “— Requirements for Qualification as a REIT — Operational Requirements — Annual Distribution Requirement” for the treatment by U.S. stockholders of net long-term capital gains that we elect to retain and pay tax on. 
 Certain Dispositions of Our Common Stock.  In general, capital gains recognized by individuals upon the sale or disposition of shares of our common stock will be subject to tax at the federal capital gains rate if such shares of common stock are held for more than 12 months, and will be taxed at ordinary income rates if such shares of common stock are held for 12 months or less. Gains recognized by stockholders that are corporations are subject to federal income tax at a current flat rate of 21%, whether or not classified as long-term capital gains. Capital losses recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of a share of our common stock held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered long-term capital losses, and are generally available only to offset capital gain income of the stockholder but not ordinary income (except in the case of individuals, trusts and estates who may offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year). In addition, any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of common stock by a stockholder who has held such shares of common stock for six months or less, after applying holding period rules, will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of distributions received from us that are required to be treated by the stockholder as long-term capital gain. In addition, under the so-called “wash sale” rules (as defined in the Code), all or a portion of any loss that a stockholder realizes upon a taxable disposition of shares of common stock may be disallowed if the stockholder purchases (including through our Reinvestment Plan) other shares of our stock (or stock substantially similar to our stock) within 30 days before or after the disposition. 
 If an investor recognizes a loss upon a subsequent disposition of our stock or other securities in an amount that exceeds a prescribed threshold, it is possible that the provisions of Treasury Regulations involving “reportable transactions” (as defined in the Code) could apply, with a resulting requirement to separately disclose the loss-generating transaction to the IRS. These regulations, though directed towards tax shelters, are broadly written and apply to transactions that would not typically be considered tax shelters. The Code imposes significant penalties for failure to comply with these requirements. 
 You should consult your tax advisor concerning any possible disclosure obligation with respect to the receipt or disposition of our stock or securities or transactions that we might undertake directly or indirectly. Moreover, you should be aware that we and other participants in the transactions in which we are involved (including their advisors) might be subject to disclosure or other requirements pursuant to these regulations, and that the failure to make such disclosures would result in substantial penalties. 
 27


Distributions we make and gain arising from the sale or exchange by a U.S. stockholder of our stock will not be treated as passive activity income. As a result, stockholders will not be able to apply any passive losses against income or gain relating to our stock. To the extent distributions we make do not constitute a return of capital or a long term capital gain (unless you elect otherwise), they will be treated as investment income for purposes of computing the investment interest limitation. 
 Additional Medicare Contribution Tax.  An additional tax of 3.8% generally will be imposed on the “net investment income” of U.S. stockholders who meet certain requirements and are individuals, estates or certain trusts. Among other items, “net investment income” generally includes gross income from dividends and net gain attributable to the disposition of certain property, such as shares of our common stock. In the case of individuals, this tax will only apply to the extent such individual’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds $200,000 ($250,000 for married couples filing a joint return and surviving spouses, and $125,000 for married individuals filing a separate return). U.S. stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible applicability of this additional tax in their particular circumstances. 
 Information Reporting Requirements and Backup Withholding for U.S. Stockholders.  As required, we will report to U.S. stockholders of our common stock and to the IRS the amount of distributions made or deemed made during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld, if any. Under some circumstances, U.S. stockholders may be subject to backup withholding on payments made with respect to, or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of, our common stock. Backup withholding will apply only if the stockholder: 

• | Fails to furnish its taxpayer identification number (which, for an individual, would typically be his or her Social Security number);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Furnishes an incorrect taxpayer identification number;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | Is notified by the IRS that the stockholder has failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends and is subject to backup withholding; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Under some circumstances, fails to certify, under penalties of perjury, that it has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and has not been notified by the IRS that the stockholder is subject to backup withholding for failure to report interest and dividend payments or has been notified by the IRS that the stockholder is no longer subject to backup withholding for failure to report those payments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to some stockholders, such as corporations in certain circumstances and tax-exempt organizations. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a U.S. stockholder will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. stockholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. stockholder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS. U.S. stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption. 
 Cost Basis Reporting.  Treasury Regulations require us to report the cost basis and gain or loss to a stockholder upon the sale or liquidation of “covered shares.” For purposes of these Treasury Regulations, all shares acquired by non-tax exempt stockholders through the Reinvestment Plan will be considered “covered shares” and will be subject to the applicable reporting requirements. 
 Upon the sale or liquidation of “covered shares,” a broker must report both the cost basis of the shares and the gain or loss recognized on the sale of those shares to the stockholder and to the IRS on Form 1099-B. In addition, stockholders that are S-corporations are no longer exempt from Form 1099-B reporting and shares purchased by an S-corporation are “covered shares” under the Treasury Regulations. If we take an organizational action such as a stock split, merger, or acquisition that affects the cost basis of “covered shares,” we will report to each stockholder and to the IRS via our website a description of any such action and the quantitative effect of that action on the cost basis on an information return. 
 We have elected the first in, first out (FIFO) method as the default for calculating the cost basis and gain or loss upon the sale or liquidation of “covered shares”. A non-tax exempt stockholder may elect a different method of computation until the settlement date of the sold or liquidated shares. We suggest that you consult with your tax advisor to determine the appropriate method of accounting for your investment.

Treatment of Tax-Exempt Stockholders 
 Tax-exempt entities, including employee pension benefit trusts and individual retirement accounts, generally are exempt from U.S. federal income taxation. These entities are subject to taxation, however, on any UBTI, as defined in the Code. The IRS has issued a published ruling that distributions from a REIT to a tax-exempt pension trust do not constitute UBTI. Although rulings are merely interpretations of law by the IRS and may be revoked or modified, based on this analysis, indebtedness incurred by us or by our operating partnership in connection with the acquisition of a property should not cause any income derived from the property to be treated as UBTI upon the distribution of those amounts as dividends to a tax-exempt U.S. stockholder of our common stock. A tax-exempt entity that incurs indebtedness to finance its purchase of our common stock, however, will be subject to UBTI under the debt-financed income rules. 
 In certain circumstances, a pension trust that owns more than 10% of our stock could be required to treat a percentage of the dividends as UBTI if we are a “pension-held REIT.” We will not be a pension-held REIT unless (i) we are required to look through one or more of our pension trust stockholders in order to satisfy the REIT “closely-held” test, and (ii) either (A) one pension trust owns more than 25% of the value of our stock, or (B) one or more pension trusts, each individually holding more than 10% of the value of our stock, collectively owns more than 50% of the value of our stock. Certain restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock generally should prevent a tax-exempt entity from owning more than 10% of the value of our stock and generally should prevent us from becoming a pension-held REIT. Tax-exempt stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the federal, state, local and foreign income and other tax consequences of owning our common stock. 
 For social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans exempt from federal income taxation under Sections 501(c)(7), (c)(9), (c)(17) and (c)(20) of the Code, respectively, income from an investment in our shares will generally constitute UBTI unless the stockholder in question is able to deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve for certain purposes so as to offset the UBTI generated. Any such organization that is a prospective stockholder should consult its own tax advisor concerning these set aside and reserve requirements, and regarding the treatment of distributions to such organization. 
 Special Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Stockholders 
 The rules governing U.S. federal income taxation of non-resident alien individuals, foreign corporations, foreign partnerships and other foreign stockholders, which we refer to collectively as “Non-U.S. holders,” are complex. The following discussion is intended only as a summary of these rules. Non-U.S. holders should consult with their own tax advisors to determine the impact of U.S. federal, state and local income tax laws on an investment in our common stock, including any reporting requirements as well as the tax treatment of the investment under the tax laws of their home country. 
 Ordinary Dividends.  The portion of distributions received by Non-U.S. holders payable out of our E&P which are not attributable to our capital gains and which are not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. holder will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at the rate of 30%, unless reduced or eliminated by treaty. Reduced treaty rates and other exemptions are not available to the extent that income is attributable to excess inclusion income allocable to the foreign stockholder. Accordingly, we will withhold at a rate of 30% on any portion of a dividend that is paid to a non-U.S. holder and attributable to that holder’s share of our excess inclusion income. As required by IRS guidance, we intend to notify our stockholders if a portion of a dividend paid by us is attributable to excess inclusion income.
 In general, Non-U.S. holders will not be considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business solely as a result of their ownership of our common stock. In cases where the distribution income from a Non-U.S. holder’s investment in our common stock is, or is treated as, effectively connected with the Non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business, the Non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to U.S. tax at graduated rates, in the same manner as U.S. stockholders are taxed with respect to such distributions, such income must generally be reported on a U.S. income tax return filed by or on behalf of the Non-U.S. holder, and the income may also be subject to the 30% branch profits tax in the case of a Non-U.S. holder that is a corporation. 
 29


Non-Dividend Distributions.  Unless our common stock constitutes a U.S. real property interest (“USRPI”), distributions by us which are not distributions out of our E&P will not be subject to U.S. income tax. If it cannot be determined at the time at which a distribution is made whether or not the distribution will exceed current and accumulated E&P, the distribution will be subject to withholding at the rate applicable to distributions. However, the Non-U.S. holder may seek a refund from the IRS of any amounts withheld if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was, in fact, in excess of our current and accumulated E&P. If our common stock constitutes a USRPI, as described below, distributions by us in excess of the sum of our E&P plus the stockholder’s basis in shares of our common stock will be taxed under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”) at the rate of tax, including any applicable capital gains rates, that would apply to a U.S. stockholder of the same type (e.g., an individual or a corporation, as the case may be), and the collection of the tax will be enforced by a refundable withholding at a rate of 15% of the amount by which the distribution exceeds the stockholder’s share of our E&P. 
 Capital Gain Distributions.  A capital gain distribution will generally not be treated as income that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, and will instead be treated the same as an ordinary distribution from us (see “— Special Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Stockholders — Ordinary Dividends”), provided that (i) the capital gain distribution is received with respect to a class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the U.S., and (ii) the recipient Non-U.S. holder does not own more than 10% of that class of stock at any time during the taxable year in which the capital gain distribution is received. If such requirements are not satisfied, distributions that are sourced from capital gains will be treated as income that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. holder without regard to whether the distribution is designated as a capital gain distribution and, in addition, shall be subject to a 21% withholding tax. We do not anticipate our common stock satisfying the “regularly traded” requirement. Distributions subject to FIRPTA may also be subject to a 30% branch profits tax in the hands of a Non-U.S. holder that is a corporation. A distribution is not a USRPI capital gain if we held the underlying asset solely as a creditor. Capital gain distributions received by a Non-U.S. holder from a REIT that are not USRPI capital gains are generally not subject to U.S. income tax, but may be subject to withholding tax. Distributions, to “qualified foreign pension funds” or entities all of the interests of which are held by “qualified foreign pension funds” are exempt from FIRPTA. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these rules.
 Estate Tax.  If our stock is owned or treated as owned by an individual who is not a citizen or resident (as specially defined for U.S. federal estate tax purposes) of the U.S. at the time of such individual’s death, the stock will be includable in the individual’s gross estate for U.S. federal estate tax purposes, unless an applicable estate tax treaty provides otherwise, and may therefore be subject to U.S. federal estate tax. 
 Dispositions of Our Common Stock.  Unless our common stock constitutes a USRPI, a sale of our common stock by a Non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. taxation under FIRPTA. Our common stock will not be treated as a USRPI if less than 50% of our assets throughout a prescribed testing period consist of interests in real property located within the U.S., excluding, for this purpose, interests in real property solely in a capacity as a creditor. 
 Even if the foregoing test is not met, our common stock nonetheless will not constitute a USRPI if we are a “domestically controlled REIT.” A “domestically controlled REIT” is a REIT in which, at all times during a specified testing period, less than 50% in value of its shares of common stock is held directly or indirectly by Non-U.S. holders. We currently anticipate that we will be a domestically controlled REIT and, therefore, the sale of our common stock should not be subject to taxation under FIRPTA. However, we cannot assure you that we are or will continue to be a domestically controlled REIT. 
 If we were not a domestically controlled REIT, whether a Non-U.S. holder’s sale of our common stock would be subject to tax under FIRPTA as a sale of a USRPI would depend on whether our common stock were “regularly traded” on an established securities market and on the size of the selling stockholder’s interest in us. 
 In addition, even if we are a domestically controlled REIT, upon disposition of our common stock (subject to the exception applicable to “regularly traded” stock described above), a non-U.S. holder may be treated as having gain from the sale or exchange of a USRPI if the non-U.S. holder (i) disposes of our common stock within a 30-day period preceding the ex-dividend date of distribution, any portion of which, but for the disposition, would have been treated as gain from the sale or exchange of a USRPI and (ii) acquires, or enters into a contract or option to acquire, other shares of our common stock within 30 days after such ex-dividend date. 
 30


If the gain on the sale of shares of common stock were subject to taxation under FIRPTA, a Non-U.S. holder would be subject to the same treatment as a U.S. stockholder with respect to the gain, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of non-resident alien individuals. 
 Gain from the sale of our common stock that would not otherwise be subject to FIRPTA will nonetheless be taxable in the U.S. to a non-U.S. holder in two cases: (i) if the non-U.S. holder’s investment in our common stock is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business conducted by such non-U.S. holder, the non-U.S. holder will be subject to the same treatment as a U.S. stockholder with respect to such gain; or (ii) if the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a “tax home” (as defined in the Code) in the U.S., the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the individual’s capital gain. 
 Information Reporting Requirements and Backup Withholding for Non-U.S. Holders.  Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors with regard to U.S. information reporting and backup withholding requirements under the Code. We will provide you with an annual IRS Form 1042-S, if required, by March 15 following the end of our fiscal year. 
Statement of Share Ownership 
 We are required to demand annual written statements from the record holders of designated percentages of our common stock disclosing the actual owners of the shares of common stock. Any record stockholder who, upon our request, does not provide us with required information concerning actual ownership of the shares of common stock is required to include specified information relating to his or her shares of common stock in his or her federal income tax return. We also must maintain, within the Internal Revenue District in which we are required to file our federal income tax return, permanent records showing the information we have received about the actual ownership of our common stock and a list of those Persons failing or refusing to comply with our demand. 
Federal Income Tax Aspects of the Operating Partnership 
 The following discussion summarizes certain federal income tax considerations applicable to our investment in the operating partnership. This discussion applies only if, and during the period that, the operating partnership is treated as a partnership instead of a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes. During the period that (i) we own 100% of the general and limited partnership interests in the operating partnership, either directly or indirectly through CHP GP, LLC and (ii) CHP GP, LLC has not elected to be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, the operating partnership will be disregarded as an entity separate from us for federal income tax purposes, and all of the operating partnership’s assets, liabilities and activities will be treated as our assets, liabilities and activities for federal income tax purposes. We do not know if or when additional interests in the operating partnership will be issued to a third party in a manner that would cause the operating partnership to cease being treated as a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes. The discussion does not cover state or local tax laws or any federal tax laws other than income tax laws. 
 Classification as a Partnership.  We will be entitled to include in our income a distributive share of the operating partnership’s income and to deduct our distributive share of the operating partnership’s losses only if the operating partnership is classified for federal income tax purposes as a partnership, rather than as a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation. Under applicable Treasury Regulations (“Check-the-Box-Regulations”), an unincorporated domestic entity with at least two members may elect to be classified either as an association taxable as a corporation or as a partnership. If the entity fails to make an election, it generally will be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. The operating partnership intends to be classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and will not elect to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation under the Check-the-Box-Regulations. 
 31


Even though the operating partnership will not elect to be treated as an association for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it may be taxed as a corporation if it is deemed to be a “publicly traded partnership.” A “publicly traded partnership” is a partnership whose interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof. Under applicable Treasury Regulations (“PTP Regulations”), limited safe harbors from the definition of a publicly traded partnership are provided. Pursuant to one of those safe harbors (“Private Placement Exclusion”), interests in a partnership will not be treated as readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof if (i) all interests in the partnership were issued in a transaction (or transactions) that were not required to be registered under the Securities Act, and (ii) the partnership does not have more than 100 partners at any time during the partnership’s taxable year. In determining the number of partners in a partnership, a person owning an interest in a flow-through entity (including a partnership, grantor trust or S corporation) that owns an interest in the partnership is treated as a partner in such partnership only if (i) substantially all of the value of the owner’s interest in the flow-through entity is attributable to the flow-through entity’s direct or indirect interest in the partnership, and (ii) a principal purpose of the use of the flow-through entity is to permit the partnership to satisfy the 100 partner limitation. We and the operating partnership believe and currently intend to take the position that the operating partnership should not be classified as a publicly traded partnership because (i) operating partnership units are not traded on an established securities market, and (ii) operating partnership units should not be considered readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof. In addition, the operating partnership presently qualifies for the Private Placement Exclusion. 
 Even if the operating partnership were considered a publicly traded partnership under the PTP Regulations, the operating partnership should not be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes as long as 90% or more of its gross income consists of “qualifying income” under section 7704(d) of the Code. In general, “qualifying income” includes interest, dividends, real property rents (as defined by section 856 of the Code) and gain from the sale or disposition of real property. If the operating partnership were characterized as a publicly traded partnership even if it were not taxable as a corporation because of the qualifying income exception, however, holders of operating partnership units would be subject to special rules under section 469 of the Code. Under such rules, each holder of operating partnership units would be required to treat any loss derived from the operating partnership separately from any income or loss derived from any other publicly traded partnership, as well as from income or loss derived from other passive activities. In such case, any net losses or credits attributable to the operating partnership which are carried forward may only be offset against future income of the operating partnership. Moreover, unlike other passive activity losses, suspended losses attributable to the operating partnership would only be allowed upon the complete disposition of the operating partnership unit holder’s entire interest in the operating partnership. 
 We have not requested, and do not intend to request, a ruling from the IRS that the operating partnership will be classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. 
 If for any reason the operating partnership were taxable as a corporation, rather than a partnership, for federal income tax purposes, we would not be able to qualify as a REIT, unless we are eligible for relief from the violation pursuant to relief provisions described above. See “— Requirements for Qualification as a REIT — Organizational Requirements” and “Requirements for Qualification as a REIT—Operational Requirements—Asset Tests” above for discussion of the effect of the failure to satisfy the REIT tests for a taxable year, and of the relief provisions. 
 In addition, any change in the operating partnership’s status for tax purposes might be treated as a taxable event, in which case we might incur a tax liability without any related cash distribution. Further, items of income and deduction of the operating partnership would not pass through to its partners, and its partners would be treated as stockholders for tax purposes. The operating partnership would be required to pay income tax at corporate tax rates on its net income, and distributions to its partners would constitute distributions that would not be deductible in computing the operating partnership’s taxable income. 
 Income Taxation of the Operating Partnership and Its Partner, Not the Operating Partnership, Subject to Tax.  A partnership generally is not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes. As a partner in the operating partnership, we will be required to take into account our allocable share of the operating partnership’s income, gains, losses, deductions and credits for any taxable year of the operating partnership ending within or with our taxable year, without regard to whether we have received or will receive any distributions from the operating partnership. 
 32


Operating Partnership Allocations.  Although a partnership agreement generally determines the allocation of income and losses among partners, such allocations will be disregarded for tax purposes if they do not comply with the provisions of section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. If an allocation is not recognized for federal income tax purposes, the item subject to the allocation will be reallocated in accordance with the partner’s interests in the partnership, which will be determined by taking into account all of the facts and circumstances relating to the economic arrangement of the partners with respect to such item. The operating partnership’s allocations of taxable income and loss are intended to comply with the requirements of section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. 
 Tax Allocations With Respect to Contributed Properties.  Pursuant to section 704(c) of the Code, income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to property that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for an interest in the partnership must, for federal income tax purposes, be shared among the partners to take account of the unrealized gain or unrealized loss associated with the property at the time of the contribution. The amount of unrealized gain or unrealized loss is generally equal to the difference between the fair market value of the contributed property at the time of contribution and the adjusted tax basis of such property at the time of contribution. Under applicable Treasury Regulations, partnerships are required to use a reasonable method for allocating items subject to section 704(c) of the Code, and several reasonable allocation methods are described therein. 
 Under the operating partnership agreement, subject to exceptions applicable to limited partnership interests, depreciation or amortization deductions of the operating partnership generally is allocated among the partners in accordance with their respective interests in the operating partnership, except to the extent that the operating partnership is required under section 704(c) of the Code to use a different method for allocating depreciation deductions attributable to its properties. In addition, gain or loss on the sale of a property that has been contributed to the operating partnership will be specially allocated to the contributing partner to the extent of any built-in gain or loss with respect to the property for federal income tax purposes. It is possible that we may (i) be allocated lower amounts of depreciation deductions for tax purposes with respect to contributed properties than would be allocated to us if each such property were to have a tax basis equal to its fair market value at the time of contribution and (ii) be allocated taxable gain in the event of a sale of such contributed properties in excess of the economic profit allocated to us as a result of such sale. These allocations may cause us to recognize taxable income in excess of cash proceeds received by us, which might adversely affect our ability to comply with the REIT distribution requirements, although we do not anticipate that this event will occur. The foregoing principles also will affect the calculation of our E&P for purposes of determining the portion of our distributions that are taxable as a dividend. The allocations described in this paragraph may result in a higher portion of our distributions being taxed as a dividend than would have occurred had we purchased such properties for cash. 
 Basis in Operating Partnership Interest.  The adjusted tax basis of our partnership interest in the operating partnership generally is equal to the amount of cash and the basis of any other property contributed to the operating partnership by us, (i) increased by (A) our allocable share of the operating partnership’s income and (B) our allocable share of indebtedness of the operating partnership, and (ii) reduced, but not below zero, by (A) our allocable share of the operating partnership’s loss and (B) the amount of cash distributed to us, including constructive cash distributions resulting from a reduction in our share of indebtedness of the operating partnership.
 If the allocation of our distributive share of the operating partnership’s loss would reduce the adjusted tax basis of our partnership interest in the operating partnership below zero, the recognition of the loss will be deferred until such time as the recognition of the loss would not reduce our adjusted tax basis below zero. If a distribution from the operating partnership or a reduction in our share of the operating partnership’s liabilities would reduce our adjusted tax basis below zero, that distribution, including a constructive distribution, will constitute taxable income to us. The gain realized by us upon the receipt of any such distribution or constructive distribution would normally be characterized as capital gain, and if our partnership interest in the operating partnership has been held for longer than the long-term capital gain holding period (currently one year), the distribution would constitute long-term capital gain. 
 33


Depreciation Deductions Available to the Operating Partnership.  The operating partnership uses a portion of contributions we make from Net Offering Proceeds to acquire interests in properties and securities. To the extent that the operating partnership acquires properties or securities for cash, the operating partnership’s initial basis in such properties for federal income tax purposes generally will be equal to the purchase price paid by the operating partnership. The operating partnership depreciates each depreciable property for federal income tax purposes under the ADS. Under ADS, the operating partnership generally depreciates buildings and improvements over a 40-year recovery period using a straight-line method and a mid-month convention and will depreciate furnishings and equipment over a 10-year recovery period using a straight-line method and a half-year convention. To the extent that properties are contributed to the operating partnership in exchange for units of the operating partnership, the operating partnership’s initial basis in each such property for federal income tax purposes should be the same as the transferor’s basis in that property on the date of contribution to the operating partnership. Although the law is not entirely clear, the operating partnership generally depreciates such depreciable property for federal income tax purposes over the same remaining useful lives and under the same methods used by the transferors. 
 Sale of the Operating Partnership’s Property.  Generally, any gain realized by the operating partnership on the sale of property held for more than one year will be long-term capital gain, except for any portion of such gain that is treated as depreciation or cost recovery recapture. Our share of any gain realized by the operating partnership on the sale of any property held by the operating partnership as inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the operating partnership’s trade or business will be treated as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a 100% tax. We, however, do not presently intend to acquire or hold or allow the operating partnership to acquire or hold any property that represents inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our or the operating partnership’s trade or business. 
Partnership Audit Rules  
 The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (“Budget Act”) changes the rules applicable to U.S. federal income tax audits of partnerships. Under the Budget Act rules (which generally took effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017), among other changes and subject to certain exceptions, any audit adjustment to items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of a partnership (and any partner’s distributive share thereof) is determined, and taxes, interest, or penalties attributable thereto are assessed and collected, at the partnership level. It is possible that the Budget Act rules could result in partnerships in which we directly or indirectly invest being required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment, and we, as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships, could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes, interest, and penalties even though we, as a REIT, may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporate-level taxes as a result of the related audit adjustment. The changes created by the Budget Act rules are sweeping and in many respects dependent on the promulgation of future regulations or other guidance by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to these changes and their potential impact on their investment in our shares.
Other Tax Considerations 
 Payments to Certain Foreign Financial Entities and Other Foreign Entities.  Withholding tax at a rate of 30% will be imposed on certain payments to you or certain foreign financial institutions (including investment funds) and other non-U.S. entities receiving payments on your behalf, including distributions in respect of shares of our stock and gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our stock, if you or such institutions fail to comply with certain due diligence and other reporting rules as set forth in Treasury Regulations. Accordingly, the entity through which shares of our stock are held will affect the determination of whether such withholding is required. Withholding currently applies to payments of dividends and the IRS has advised that future guidance may provide that certain other payments made to or by certain foreign financial institutions may be subject to a 30% federal withholding tax.. Stockholders that are otherwise eligible for an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. withholding taxes with respect to such dividends will be required to seek a refund from the IRS to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction. Additional requirements and conditions may be imposed pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement, if and when entered into, between the U.S. and such institution’s home jurisdiction. We will not pay any additional amounts to any stockholders in respect of any amounts withheld. You are encouraged to consult with your tax advisor regarding U.S. withholding taxes and the application of the Treasury Regulations in light of your particular circumstances. 
 34


Legislative or Other Actions Affecting REITs.  Current and prospective holders of our stock should recognize the present federal income tax treatment of an investment in our stock may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time and that any such action may affect investments and commitments previously made. For example, the Tax Act, which the U.S. President signed into law on December 22, 2017, significantly changes the U.S. federal income tax system, including rules that directly and indirectly affect REITs and their stockholders. The rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to the federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could adversely affect an investment in our stock. 
 State, Local and Foreign Taxes.  We and our subsidiaries and stockholders may be subject to state, local or foreign taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we or they transact business, own property or reside. We own properties located in numerous jurisdictions, and may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions. Our state, local or foreign tax treatment and that of our stockholders may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed above. To the extent, if any, that we or our subsidiaries own assets, directly or indirectly, or conduct operations in foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to foreign tax systems. Our favorable tax treatment in the U.S. as a REIT may not be recognized by foreign jurisdictions where we may be treated as a foreign corporation or other type of entity subject to a variety of taxes, such as income, corporate, trade, local and capital taxes, and distributions from such operations may be subject to withholding both as to dividends and interest paid to us. 
 Although we will seek to reduce the foreign taxes payable on foreign operations, it is unlikely that we will be able to mitigate totally such taxes, which could be significant. To the extent we incur such foreign taxes; we will receive reduced amounts from foreign operations and will have less cash available for distribution to our stockholders. Further, the foreign taxes cannot be passed through to our stockholders as a foreign tax credit and we cannot generally make effective use of foreign tax credits. As a result, we expect that neither we nor our stockholders will be able to reduce U.S. tax liability on account of our payment of foreign taxes. Accordingly, foreign taxes would impact our operations as an additional cost. Furthermore, the fundamental changes made by the Tax Act to the U.S. international tax system could significantly impact our foreign tax exposure if we, or our subsidiaries, were to make investments in foreign jurisdictions. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the application and effect of state, local and foreign income and other tax laws on an investment in our stock.
