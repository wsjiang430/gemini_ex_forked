 Our Business Model
 Regulated Business-to-Business Operations
 We focus on providing business-to-business services in areas of operations that are highly regulated.  By helping our customers maintain compliance with complex regulations, we protect people and brands, promote health, and safeguard the environment.  Governmental legislation and regulation increasingly requires the proper handling and disposal of items such as medical waste, hazardous waste, pharmaceutical waste, and personal confidential information.  Regulated waste can be defined as any material with government-imposed guidelines for handling the material for transportation or disposal.

• | Medical waste, such as needles, syringes, gloves, cultures, and potentially infectious agents, blood and blood products, can potentially cause an infectious disease.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hazardous waste is designated and governed by federal and local environmental protection agencies. It generally includes waste that is considered dangerous or potentially harmful to our health or the environment during transportation and disposal.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pharmaceutical waste may be hazardous or nonhazardous and consists of expired, recalled, or otherwise unused pharmaceuticals.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Personal confidential information includes documents and e-media containing protected healthcare information, financial information, or other confidential information.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Small Customers with Recurring Service Needs
 We also focus on serving smaller businesses which often have an even greater need for support with compliance matters because they tend to lack the specialized staff that is found at larger businesses.  With a small business, regulatory and compliance matters are often managed by a business owner, office manager, or facility supervisor who manage multiple functions for the organization and often lack the time and resources to properly investigate and comply with a wide range of regulations that may impact their operations.
Organic Growth from New Customers and Additional Services 
 As a leading provider of regulated and compliance solutions, we continue to focus on enhancing our service offerings and platforms to exceed customer expectations.  We have developed a strong and loyal customer base, with, we believe, a revenue retention rate of approximately 90% (based on our internal customer attrition analysis) and have been able to leverage these customer relationships to provide additional services.  Our growth strategy focuses on securing new customer relationships and selling additional services to existing customers.

Growth through Acquisition
 The various regulated waste and compliance, including secure documentation destruction, services that we provide tend to be in highly fragmented industries.  We have proven that acquisitions are a steady and efficient way to scale operations, build critical customer density for transportation and treatment operations, and enter new markets or geographies, as well as provide opportunity to introduce our additional services to the acquired customers.  In our early history, acquisitions were a key strategy to rapidly building our customer base and route density in the United States.  We have been able to expand internationally through acquisition and now serve customers in 20 international markets outside the U.S.  Stericycle has completed over 500 acquisitions, with 21, completed during 2018. We expect to continue our acquisition strategy, remaining focused on small, highly accretive, tuck-in acquisitions that broaden our various service capabilities while creating value for our shareholders.
Business Transformation
 Stericycle is focused on driving long-term growth and profitability and delivering enhanced shareholder value.  As part of our business strategy, in the third quarter of 2017, we initiated a comprehensive multiyear Business Transformation with the objective to improve long-term operational and financial performance.  The Business Transformation is based on a strategic vision to build a best-in-class enterprise performance management (“EPM”) operating model and includes streamlining our portfolio, realigning our processes and organizational structure to drive efficiency, and implementing an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. 
 Key initiatives of the Business Transformation include:
  
• | Portfolio Rationalization: Executing on a comprehensive review of the Company’s global service lines to identify and pursue the divestiture of non-strategic assets. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Operational Optimization: Standardizing route planning logistics, modernizing field operations, and driving network efficiency across facilities. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Organizational Excellence and Efficiency: Redesigning the Company’s organizational structure to optimize resources and align around a global shared business services model. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commercial Excellence: Aligning our sales and service organizations around the customer, standardizing our customer relationship management process, and expanding customer self-service options. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strategic Sourcing: Reducing spend through global procure-to-pay processes and leveraging organizational scale. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Execution of the Business Transformation began in 2017 with the identification and validation of key transformational opportunities as well as an organizational restructuring which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2017.  Execution of the Business Transformation is expected to continue with the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system in the U.S. and Canada during 2020 followed by the international rollout beginning in 2021.
 On August 2, 2018, we announced, as part of the Portfolio Rationalization strategy within Business Transformation that we are pursuing strategic alternatives for the recall and communications services which are non-core Communication & Related Services business (“CRS”), demonstrating our commitment

 Market Size and Growth Potential
 We provide a wide range of services across multiple market segments and industries.  Based on various industry studies and management’s estimates, we estimate the size of the global market for the services we provide, in the geographies where we currently operate is approximately $38 billion (including global markets with established regulatory frameworks for medical waste plus global markets in which Stericycle operates for hazardous waste, information destruction and communication services.  Growth in this industry in which we operate is driven by a number of factors, including:

• | Aging Population: The average age of the population in the countries where we operate is rising. As people age, they typically require more medical attention and a wider variety of tests, procedures, and medications, leading to an increase in the quantity of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste, and pharmaceutical waste, as well as an increase in confidential healthcare records requiring secure destruction. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pressure to Reduce Healthcare Costs While Improving Outcomes: The healthcare industry is under pressure to reduce costs and at the same time improve healthcare outcomes for patients served. By outsourcing services not directly tied to the delivery of healthcare services, these organizations can potentially reduce costs and improve staff efficiencies. By leveraging third party experts, healthcare organizations may also limit their potential liability for regulatory compliance. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enforcement of Waste Regulations: Enforcement of regulations relating to the management of regulated waste is increasing. Penalties for violations can be costly and high profile, thereby impacting a business’ overall reputation. Greater enforcement combined with higher penalties results in more compliance and a corresponding increase in potential customers. We believe that many businesses are unaware either of the need for proper training of employees or of applicable regulatory requirements. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased Business Focus on Sustainability: Businesses large and small are continuing to realize that a focus on sustainability is now essential to operating efficiently and meeting the increasing demands of customers for environmental responsibility. Such pressures are driving proper disposal of pharmaceuticals, recycling efforts, creative disposal efforts for unused inventory, shred-all policies for paper, and other initiatives supported by our services. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regulation of Privacy and Information Security and Concerns over Data Breaches: The continued development and growth of the secure information destruction industry has been driven, in part, by the need for compliance with increasing government regulation with respect to privacy and information security. These regulations take different forms, with some requiring organizations to establish reasonable measures to protect against loss, theft and unauthorized access, use and disclosure, and others imposing data retention requirements that require businesses to destroy or render anonymous personal information when it’s no longer required for a legal or legitimate business

purpose. Secure information destruction services are increasingly a standard measure that organizations use to meet their legal safeguarding and retention requirements. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Market Expansion Due to Increased Outsourcing: With regard to secure information destruction services and communication services, we believe significant market growth will come from increased reliance on outsourced service providers. Many small businesses currently do not use services or manage these needs with internal resources and solutions. Opportunity exists to convert these businesses as the trend to outsource support services continues. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Strengths
 We believe that we benefit from the following competitive strengths, among others:
  
• | Strong Service Relationships with Customers: We offer our customers necessary services which require routine access to their facilities, operating information, or customer data. This relationship, supported by a history of strong service, allows us access to decision makers to offer additional opportunities. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Long-term Contracts: The majority of services we provide involve long-term contracts that are often renewed. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Established Network of Processing and Transportation Locations in Each Country: We believe that our infrastructure network results in an efficient operation with alternate treatment or destruction options for our customers. The scale of our network also provides us the ability to be the single-source provider for customers with multiple locations across the country and gives us the flexibility to quickly redirect services or operations to another location if the need arises due to severe weather, power outages, or other disruptions. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Routing Logistics: Within our logistics-based services lines, we maintain a vast transportation network that is focused on route efficiency. This advantage has been built from a deliberate focus on route density and technological investments to optimize routing at both the individual truck and geographic market level. Our Business Transformation and ERP implementation will improve our routing efficiencies by providing the opportunity to leverage our infrastructure across services lines. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Industry Leadership and Expertise: Based on our infrastructure and revenues, we maintain a global leadership position across our various services lines, including regulated medical waste, retail and healthcare hazardous waste, secure information destruction, and product recalls and returns. We attract and retain highly experienced team members who have a deep understanding of the industries they serve, the regulatory climate, and the evolving needs of the customers we serve. We collaborate regularly with a wide range of stakeholders and interest groups. We proactively work with organizations like the CDC, DEA, OSHA, EPA, and many other government and regulatory bodies, including law enforcement. Our experts are frequent speakers at hospital networks, industry trade associations, and actively engage in numerous community meetings each year.

Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) covering the European Union (“EU”), and other data security regulations abroad.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broad Range of Services: We leverage our expertise in specialty waste and compliance to offer our customers a broad range of complementary services. Offering multiple services reduces administrative burden for our customers as fewer vendors are required. Additionally, we believe loyalty among customers is stronger when more than one service is leveraged.

Regulated Waste and Compliance Service Operations
 Collection and Transportation
 The collection process for regulated waste streams begins at the customer location with segregation.  To assure regulatory compliance, we will not accept material from customers unless it complies with our waste acceptance protocols and is properly stored or packaged in containers that we have either supplied or approved.
 Our fleet of vehicles then collects containers at the customer location.  The majority of collected waste is then transported directly to one of our processing facilities or to one of our transfer stations until it’s transported to a processing facility.  Our use of transfer stations in a "hub and spoke" configuration improves the efficiency of our collection and transportation operations by expanding the geographic area that a particular processing facility can serve, thereby increasing the utilization of the facility and the volume of waste that it processes.

Processing and Disposal of Regulated Medical Waste
 Upon arrival at a processing facility, containers or boxes of regulated waste undergo a quality control process to verify that they do not contain any unacceptable substances. Any container or box that is discovered to contain unacceptable waste goes through a corrective action process which could include redirecting the waste, returning the waste to the customer, and/or notifying the appropriate regulatory authorities. From there, regulated medical waste is processed using one of several treatments or processing technologies, predominantly at one of our wholly-owned facilities:

• | Autoclaving: Autoclaving is the primary method of medical waste treatment. This process relies on steam at high temperature and pressure to kill pathogens and render materials non-infectious. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Alternative Technologies: We use a number of different non-incineration alternatives to autoclaves, predominantly outside of the U.S. The processes used by these technologies are similar, as the regulated waste is heated to a specified temperature for a required time to kill the pathogens. This is not always under pressure. Depending on local requirements, the waste may be shredded before or after treatment to render it unrecognizable. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Incineration: Incineration burns regulated waste at elevated temperatures and reduces it to ash. Incineration reduces the volume of waste, and it is the recommended treatment and disposal option for some types of regulated waste such as anatomical waste, residues from chemotherapy procedures, and non-hazardous pharmaceutical waste. Air emissions from incinerators can contain certain byproducts that are subject to federal, state, and in some cases, local regulation. In some circumstances, the ash byproduct of incineration may be regulated. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Upon completion of the particular treatment process, the resulting waste or incinerator ash is transported for disposal in a landfill owned by unaffiliated third parties.  In some countries, where permitted by regulation, the treated waste is recovered, including recovery as fuel in waste-to-energy processes.
 Processing and Disposal of Hazardous Wastes
 Our technicians receive hazardous wastes either as expired goods requiring deconstruction or as defined hazardous wastes.  Expired goods are deconstructed to recover metals and plastics for recycling thereby minimizing the total volume of waste disposed of as hazardous waste.  Materials that are predefined as hazardous upon collection are bulked together or consolidated at treatment storage and disposal facilities for more efficient transport to the final disposal or processing destination.  Whenever possible, we seek sustainable solutions for managing materials including alternative uses, recovery processes, recycling options, fuel blending, or energy recovery.  When sustainable options do not exist, these wastes are sent to third parties for incineration, landfill or water treatment.
Destruction and Recycling of Secure Information
 If not shredded on site in a Shred-it® truck with proprietary information destruction technology, documents are sent to a shredding facility for secure destruction.  Documents are cross-cut shredded and then baled to be sold as sorted office paper (“SOP”) for recycling.

Communication and Related Services Overview
 Our Communication Solutions service line provides a broad range of live voice and automated service offerings to assist our clients in delivering a best in class communications stream with their patients and customers.  Our team serves as a client representative providing answering services, appointment scheduling, appointment reminders, event registration, and other necessary communications.  Providing these solutions requires sophisticated information management systems to redirect calls, store and quickly retrieve live voice protocols or client data, send automated communications, or provide easily accessible reporting and activity details to our customers.  Beyond the information management system infrastructure, call center staffing and proper education levels are critical to our success.  We leverage sophisticated workflow analysis and staffing tools to ensure appropriate resources are in place in order to handle call volumes quickly and consistently across our multiple call centers during peak volumes.
 Our Expert Solutions service line specializes in partnering with automotive, food/beverage, medical device, pharmaceutical, consumer goods manufacturers, and retailers to support them through critical recalls, retrievals, or audit processes to ensure brand protection.  Services could include notification services to impacted customers, call center services to support a recall or retrieval, removing impacted product from distribution, processing recalled product and supporting remedy requirements, and compliance reporting.  These solutions are highly customized based on the product being recalled or retrieved and the specific needs of the client.
 Competition
 The industries and markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and barriers to entry are low.  Our competitors consist of many different types of service providers, including national, regional, and local companies.  In the regulated waste and secure information destruction industries, another major source of competition is on-site management.  For regulated medical waste, some large-quantity generators, particularly hospitals, may choose an onsite autoclave or other treatment process.  For secure information destruction, many businesses may choose to use small, on-site shredders for their documents.  Similarly, customers could handle recalls or communication needs internally.
 In addition, we face potential competition from businesses that are attempting to commercialize a wide range of technologies that directly or indirectly reduce the need for regulated medical waste, hazardous waste or secure information destruction services.
 Governmental Regulation
 The regulated medical waste, hazardous waste, secure information destruction, and recall industries are subject to numerous regulations.  In many countries there are multiple regulatory agencies at the local and national level that affect our customers or our services.  This regulatory framework imposes a variety of compliance requirements, including requirements to obtain and maintain government permits.  We maintain numerous governmental permits, registrations, and licenses to conduct our business in the jurisdictions in which we operate.  Our permits vary by jurisdiction based upon our activities within that jurisdiction and on the applicable laws and regulations of that jurisdiction.  These permits grant us the authority, among other things:

• | to construct and operate collection, transfer, and processing facilities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


2018 10-K Annual Report | Stericycle, Inc. • 13 
------------------------+------------------------


PART I

• | to transport regulated waste within and between relevant jurisdictions; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to handle particular regulated substances.
--+-------------------------------------------

 Our permits may be subject to modification or revocation by the issuing authority and, in some jurisdictions, are subject to periodic renewal.  Periodic renewals may be subject to public participation and can lead to additional regulatory oversight.  We are also subject to regulations that govern the definition, generation, segregation, handling, packaging, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of regulated waste.  In addition, we are subject to extensive regulations to ensure public and employee health and safety at the federal, state and local levels.
 U.S. Federal and Foreign Regulation
 We are subject to substantial regulations enacted and enforced by the U.S. government and by the governments of the foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct regulated waste and secure information destruction operations.  The regulatory requirements with which we must comply vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  The laws governing our domestic and international operations generally consist of statutes, legislation, and regulations concerning environmental protection, employee health and welfare, transportation, the use of the mail, ethical business conduct, and proper handling and management of regulated waste streams, controlled substances, and personal and confidential information.
 Environmental Protection
 Certain service lines within our business are subject to extensive and evolving environmental regulations in all of the geographies in which we operate.  Generally, the environmental laws we are subject to regulate the handling, transporting, and disposing of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, the release or potential release of hazardous substances into the environment, the discharge of pollutants into streams, rivers, groundwater, and other surface waters, and the emission of pollutants into the air.  The principal environmental laws that govern our operations in the U.S. are state environmental regulatory agencies as they provide the specific legislative and/or regulatory frameworks which require the management and treatment of regulated medical waste.  Additionally, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 ("RCRA"), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA"), and the Clean Air Act of 1970 are the federal regulations that affect management of certain aspects of regulated medical waste and all RCRA hazardous wastes.  CERCLA and state laws similar to it may impose strict, joint and several liabilities on the current and former owners and operators of facilities from which release of hazardous substances has occurred and on the generators and transporters of the hazardous substances that come to be located at these facilities.  The 10 incinerators we currently operate in the U.S. must comply with the emissions standards imposed by the applicable states permitting authorities pursuant to regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act as well as state and/or municipal waste permit requirements.
 Examples of environmental laws applicable to our international operations include the Waste Framework Directive, Environmental Liabilities Directive, Industrial Emissions Directive and the Shipments of Waste Regulations in the EU, Ley 154 (Residuos Patogenicos) in Argentina, Lei 12.305/2010 (Lei Ordinária) Institui A Política Nacional De Resíduos Sólidos in Brazil, and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and related regulations in Canada.  Additional environmental laws at the federal and/or local levels apply to regulated waste management in other markets in which we conduct business.

Employee Health and Welfare
 We are subject to numerous regulations promulgated to protect and promote worker health and welfare through the implementation and enforcement of standards designed to prevent illness, injury and death in the workplace.  The primary U.S. federal laws relating to employee health and welfare applicable to our business are in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 ("OSHA"), which establishes specific employer responsibilities including engineering controls, administrative controls, training, policies and programs complying with the regulations, and recordkeeping and reporting, all in an effort to ensure a safe workplace.  Various OSHA standards apply to almost all aspects of our operations and govern such matters as exposure to blood-borne pathogens, hazard communication, personal and protective equipment.
 Examples of employee health and welfare laws applicable to our international operations include the European Framework Directive on Safety and Health at Work (Directive 89/391 EEC), and various provisions of the Canada Labour Code and related occupational safety and health regulations in the provinces and territories of Canada.
 Transportation
 Various laws regulating the transportation of waste and other potentially hazardous materials also apply to the services we provide.  In the U.S., the Department of Transportation ("DOT") has promulgated regulations which deal with two different aspects of transportation: hazardous materials transport and safety in transportation.  These regulations are defined within the Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA") and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ("FMCSA").  These federal requirements plus additional state requirements are closely monitored internally.  Due to our fleet size we are regularly subject to road side inspections.  These inspections have a cumulative effect on our compliance history and require us to remain in good standing so as not to jeopardize our permits.
 Examples of transportation laws applicable to our international operations include the Directive on the Inland Transportation of Dangerous Goods in the EU and the Transport of Dangerous Goods Act and related regulations in Canada, and globally the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code and the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations.
 Document Management
 Numerous laws and regulations require proper protection of confidential customer information by business parties that have access to such information.  In the U.S., the most commonly cited regulations include the Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act (“FACTA”) Final Disposal Rule, the FACTA Red Flag Rule, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) Privacy Rule, and the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (“GLBA”).  Furthermore the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) provides the framework for data privacy and data protection for companies that conduct business in Europe.
 For the transportation of secure information for destruction, we are regulated by the U.S. DOT as a commercial motor carrier.  The processes for the destruction of secure information destruction processes are not regulated by any government agency.  However, the National Association of Information Destruction (“NAID”) maintains a certification to ensure that destruction processes support the needs of organizations to meet laws and regulations relating to the protection of confidential information.  We currently hold the NAID AAA Certification for our operations in North America.  Further, the Payment Card

Industry ("PCI") Security Standards Council has developed Data Security Standards which are imposed upon merchants utilizing credit cards and require destruction of documents and media in accordance with their standards.
 Ethical Business Conduct
 Various international regulations governing ethical business practices apply to our business, including but not limited to, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act (“Bribery Act”), and the Brazilian Clean Companies Act.  These laws may apply to our business on both a global and local basis, and ban unethical behavior such as the payment of bribes to government officials for the purpose of gaining an improper business advantage, improper maintenance of our books and records, as well as other financial transparency requirements.
 Use of the Mail in the U.S.
 The United States Postal Service ("USPS") has its own set of specific regulations defined in Publication 52 which governs the use of the postal system for mailing of hazardous, restricted and perishable materials.  More specifically, mailback management offerings for sharps, medical waste, and pharmaceutical wastes, require us to obtain and maintain authorization permits from the USPS.  We have obtained permits from the USPS to conduct our "mail-back" programs which provide a convenient service for customers who need such a service with approved containers for "sharps" (needles, knives, broken glass, and the like) or other regulated wastes to be sent directly to a treatment facility.
 Controlled Substances
 Our service offerings for the recall, return and/or destruction of controlled substance pharmaceuticals are subject to numerous laws and regulations under various international federal agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA") in the U.S. and the Home Office Drugs and Firearm Licensing Unit in the U.K.  These regulations apply to both the closed loop management of controlled substances as well as the return of unused controlled substances from consumers.  These regulations typically require facilities to obtain a controlled substance registration in addition to other pharmaceutical licenses and meet certain criteria in order to collect, process, and dispose of controlled substances.  These regulations have very strict requirements for the management of employees, the type of security within facilities, recordkeeping, and the reporting of all controlled substances managed at the facility.  Much like our other permitting, the registration must be updated regularly and subjects us to inspection and enforcement.
 U.S. and Foreign Local Regulation
 We conduct business in all 50 U.S. States and Puerto Rico.  Because the U.S. EPA does not promulgate regulations for regulated medical waste at a national level, each state has its own regulations related to the handling, treatment, and storage of regulated medical waste.  Many states have followed requirements similar to the Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988 or have placed medical waste regulations under solid waste regulations.  Hazardous waste in the U.S. is regulated under the RCRA.  In addition, certain states may have their own regulations for handling, treatment and storage of hazardous wastes.  Regulated garbage (sometimes referred to as “APHIS waste” taken from the Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service) is another area of regulatory requirements we are subject to pursuant to regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA") and Customers and Border Patrol.  The USDA typically inspects our facilities receiving such APHIS waste on a quarterly basis.
