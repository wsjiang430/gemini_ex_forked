ITEM 1        BUSINESS
Bank of Marin (the “Bank”) was incorporated in August 1989, received its charter from the California Superintendent of Banks (now the California Department of Business Oversight or "DBO") and commenced operations in January 1990. The Bank is an insured bank by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). Bank of Marin Bancorp (“Bancorp”) was formed in 2007 and the Bank became its sole subsidiary when each share of Bank common stock was exchanged for one share of Bancorp common stock. Bancorp is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol BMRC. Upon formation of the holding company, Bancorp became subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and reporting and examination requirements by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve"). Bancorp files periodic reports and proxy statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
References in this report to “Bancorp” mean Bank of Marin Bancorp, parent holding company for the Bank. References to “we,” “our,” “us” mean the holding company and the Bank that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes.
Virtually all of our business is conducted through Bancorp's subsidiary, Bank of Marin, which is headquartered in Novato, California. In addition to our headquarters, we operate twenty-three offices in Marin, Sonoma, San Francisco, Napa and Alameda counties, with a strong emphasis on supporting the local communities. Our customer base is made up of business and personal banking relationships from the communities near the branch office locations. Our business banking focus is on small to medium-sized businesses, professionals and not-for-profit organizations.

All service marks registered by Bancorp or the Bank are registered on the United States Patent & Trademark Office Principal Register.
Market Area
Our primary market area consists of Marin, San Francisco, Napa, Sonoma and Alameda counties. Our customer base is primarily made up of business, not-for-profit and personal banking relationships within these market areas.
As discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in ITEM 8 of this report, in November 2017, we expanded our presence in Napa County through the acquisition of Bank of Napa, N.A. This resulted in the addition of $302.1 million of assets and the assumption of $251.9 million of liabilities, as well as the addition of two branch offices serving the city of Napa.
We attract deposit relationships from small to medium-sized businesses, not-for-profit organizations and professionals, merchants and individuals who live and/or work in the communities comprising our market areas. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 59% of our deposits were in Marin County and southern Sonoma County, and approximately 58% of our deposits were from businesses and 42% from individuals.
Competition
The banking business in California generally, and in our market area specifically, is highly competitive with respect to attracting both loan and deposit relationships. The increasingly competitive environment is affected by changes in regulation, interest rates, technology and product delivery systems, and consolidation among financial service providers. The banking industry is seeing strong competition for quality loans, with larger banks expanding their activities to attract businesses that are traditionally community bank customers. In all of our five counties, we have significant competition
Page-5

from nationwide banks with much larger branch networks and greater financial resources, as well as credit unions and other local and regional banks. Nationwide banks have the competitive advantages of national advertising campaigns. Large commercial banks also have substantially greater lending limits and the ability to offer certain services, which are not offered directly by us. Other competitors for depositors' funds are money market mutual funds and non-bank financial institutions such as brokerage firms and insurance companies. 
We differentiate ourselves from the numerous, and often larger, financial institutions in our primary market area, with a business model built on relationship banking, disciplined fundamentals and commitment to the communities we serve. The Bank's experienced professionals deliver innovative and custom financing, with a deep local market knowledge and a personal understanding of each customer's unique needs.
In Marin County, we have the third largest market share of total deposits at 10.8%, based upon FDIC deposit market share data as of June 30, 20181. A significant driver of our franchise value is the growth and stability of our deposits, a low-cost funding source for our loan portfolio. 
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we employed 290 full-time equivalent (“FTE”) staff. The actual number of employees, including part-time employees, at year-end 2018 included seven executive officers, 120 other corporate officers and 178 staff. None of our employees are presently represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our employee relations are good. We have consistently been recognized as one of the “Best Places to Work” by the North Bay Business Journal.
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
Bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. The following discussion summarizes certain significant laws, rules and regulations affecting Bancorp and the Bank. 
Bank Holding Company Regulation
Upon formation of the bank holding company on July 1, 2007, we became subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”) which subjects Bancorp to Federal Reserve reporting and examination requirements. Under the Federal Reserve law and regulations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks. Under this requirement, we are expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources, and it may not be in our, or our shareholders’ or creditors’, best interests to do so. In addition, any capital loans we make to the Bank are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of the Bank. The BHCA regulates the activities of holding companies including acquisitions, mergers and consolidations and, together with the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act of 1999, the scope of allowable banking activities. Bancorp is also a bank holding company within the meaning of the California Financial Code. As such, Bancorp and its subsidiaries are subject to examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the DBO.
Bank Regulation
Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect consumers, depositors' funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole. These regulations affect our lending practices, consumer protections, capital structure, investment practices and dividend policy.
As a state chartered bank, we are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the DBO. We are also subject to regulation, supervision and periodic examination by the FDIC. If, as a result of an examination of the Bank, the FDIC or the DBO should determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of our operations are unsatisfactory, or that we have violated any law or regulation, various remedies are available to those regulators including issuing a “cease and desist” order, monetary penalties, restitution, restricting our growth or removing officers and directors.

The Bank addresses the many state and federal regulations it is subject to through a comprehensive compliance program that addresses the various risks associated with these issues.
Safety and Soundness Standards (Risk Management) 
The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines that establish operational and managerial standards to promote the safety and soundness of federally insured depository institutions. The guidelines set forth standards for internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings.
During the past decade, the bank regulatory agencies have increasingly emphasized the importance of sound risk management processes and strong internal controls when evaluating the activities of the financial institutions they supervise. Properly managing risks has been identified as critical to the conduct of safe and sound banking activities and has become even more important as new technologies, product innovation, and the size and speed of financial transactions have changed the nature of banking markets. The agencies have identified a spectrum of risks facing a banking institution including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal, and reputational. In particular, recent regulatory pronouncements have focused on operational risk, which arises from the potential that inadequate information systems, operational problems, breaches in internal controls, fraud, or unforeseen catastrophes will result in unexpected losses. New products and services, third-party risk management and cybersecurity are critical sources of operational risk that financial institutions are expected to address in the current environment. The Board of Directors and various sub-committees oversee Bancorp's consolidated enterprise risk management program that ensures the adequacy of policies, procedures, tolerance levels, risk measurement systems, monitoring processes, management information systems and internal controls.
Dividends
The payment of cash dividends by the Bank to Bancorp is subject to restrictions set forth in the California Financial Code (the “Code”) in addition to regulations and policy statements of the Federal Reserve. Prior to any distribution from the Bank to Bancorp, a calculation is made to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Code and to ensure that the Bank remains within capital guidelines set forth by the DBO and the FDIC. See also Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under the heading “Dividends” in ITEM 8 of this report. 
FDIC Insurance Assessments
The FDIC insures our customers' deposits to the maximum amount permitted by law, which is currently $250,000 per depositor, based on the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). 
Our FDIC insurance assessment base is comprised of quarterly average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. FDIC's assessment rates are currently between 1.5 and 40 basis points annually on the assessment base for banks in all risk categories. In deriving the risk categories, the FDIC uses a bank's capital level, supervisory ratios and other financial measures to determine a bank's ability to withstand financial stress.
Community Reinvestment Act
Congress enacted the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) in 1977 to encourage financial institutions to meet the credit needs of the communities in which they are located. All banks and thrifts have a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with safe and sound operations, to help meet the credit needs of their entire communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. Regulatory agencies rate each bank's performance in assessing and meeting these credit needs. The Bank is committed to serving the credit needs of the communities in which we do business, and it is our policy to respond to all creditworthy segments of our market. As part of its CRA commitment, the Bank maintains strong philanthropic ties to the community. We invest in affordable housing projects that help economically disadvantaged individuals and residents of low- and moderate-income census tracts, in each case consistent with our long-established prudent underwriting practices. We also donate to, invest in and volunteer with organizations that serve the communities in which we do business, especially low- and moderate-income individuals. These organizations offer educational and health programs to economically disadvantaged students and families, community development services and affordable housing programs. We offer CRA reportable small business, small farm and community development loans within our assessment areas. The CRA requires a depository institution's 
Page-7

primary federal regulator, in connection with its examination of the institution, to assess the institution's record in meeting CRA requirements. The regulatory agency's assessment of the institution's record is made available to the public. This record is taken into consideration when the institution establishes a new branch that accepts deposits, relocates an office, applies to merge or consolidate, or expands into other activities. The FDIC assigned a “Satisfactory” rating to its CRA performance examination completed in January 2018, which was performed under the large bank requirements.
Anti-Money-Laundering Regulations
A series of banking laws and regulations beginning with the Bank Secrecy Act in 1970 requires banks to prevent, detect, and report illicit or illegal financial activities to the federal government to prevent money laundering, international drug trafficking, and terrorism. Under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, requirements regarding the Customer Identification Program, as well as enhanced due diligence and “know your customer” standards in their dealings with high risk customers, foreign financial institutions, and foreign individuals and entities. The Customer Due Diligence Rules under the Bank Secrecy Act clarify and strengthen customer due diligence requirements. These rules contain explicit customer due diligence requirements which include a new requirement to identify and verify the identity of beneficial owners of legal entity customers.
Privacy and Data Security
The Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (“GLBA”) of 1999 imposes requirements on financial institutions with respect to consumer privacy and the disclosure of non-public personal information about individuals who apply for or obtain a financial product to be used for personal, family or household purposes. The GLBA generally prohibits disclosure of consumer information to most nonaffiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to consumers and the conditions under which an institution may disclose non-public information about a consumer to a nonaffiliated third-party. The GLBA also directs federal regulators, including the FDIC, to prescribe standards for the security of consumer information. We are subject to such standards, as well as standards for notifying consumers in the event of a security breach. We must disclose our privacy policy to consumers and permit consumers to "opt out" of having non-public customer information disclosed to third parties. We are required to have an information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of customer information and to ensure proper disposal of information that is no longer needed. We notify our customers when unauthorized disclosure involves sensitive customer information that may be misused.
Consumer Protection Regulations
Our lending activities are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers, including the CRA, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Lending, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Flood Disaster Protection Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, Truth-in-Lending Act ("TILA"), the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ("RESPA"), and the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act ("SAFE"). Our deposit operations are also subject to laws and regulations that protect consumer rights including Expedited Funds Availability, Truth in Savings Act ("TISA"), and Electronic Funds Transfers. Other regulatory requirements include: the Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts and Practices ("UDAAP"), Dodd-Frank Act, Right to Financial Privacy and Privacy of Consumer Financial Information. Additional rules govern check writing ability on certain interest earning accounts and prescribe procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records. 
Restriction on Transactions between Bank's Affiliates
Transactions between Bancorp and the Bank are quantitatively and qualitatively restricted under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Regulation W. Section 23A places restrictions on the Bank's “covered transactions” with Bancorp, including loans and other extensions of credit, investments in the securities of, and purchases of assets from Bancorp. Section 23B requires that certain transactions, including all covered transactions, be on market terms and conditions. Federal Reserve Regulation W combines statutory restrictions on transactions between the Bank and Bancorp with Federal Reserve interpretations in an effort to simplify compliance with Sections 23A and 23B.

Capital Requirements
The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and banks. Bancorp's ratios exceed the required minimum ratios for capital adequacy purposes and the Bank meets the definition for "well capitalized." Undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to significant restrictions. Banks that are categorized as "critically undercapitalized" under applicable FDIC regulations are subject to dividend restrictions.
In July 2013, the federal banking regulators approved a final rule to implement the revised capital adequacy standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly called Basel III, which became effective January 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period). The final rule strengthened the definition of regulatory capital, increased risk-based capital requirements, made selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets, and adjusted the prompt corrective action thresholds. We were in compliance throughout the phase-in period and implemented the fully phased-in capital rules as of January 1, 2019. For additional information on our risk-based capital positions, refer to the Capital Adequacy section within ITEM 7 to Management's Discussion and Analysis and the Consolidated Financial Statements within ITEM 8 of Note 15 to this report.
In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms, which standards are commonly referred to as Basel IV. Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee’s standardized approach for credit risk (including the recalibration of the risk weights and the introduction of new capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments,” such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provides a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework, these standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2027. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and are not applicable to the Bank. The impact of Basel IV on us will depend on how it is implemented by the federal bank regulators. See also "The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act" section in this ITEM for a discussion of a proposed joint regulatory rule relating to capital for qualifying community banking organizations such as the Bank and such proposed rule making’s impact on Basel III and IV. 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
The Dodd-Frank Act, a landmark financial reform bill comprised of voluminous new rules and restrictions on bank operations, included provisions aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis and a new process for winding down failing, systemically important institutions in a manner as close to a controlled bankruptcy as possible. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act established new government oversight responsibilities, enhanced capital adequacy requirements for certain institutions, established consumer protection laws and regulations, and placed limitations on certain banking activities. The current Presidential Administration ("Administration") issued an executive order to consider reforming the Dodd-Frank Act in order to reduce the regulatory burden on U.S. companies, including financial institutions.
The Administration recently signed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”), which repeals or modifies certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and eases regulations on all but the largest banks. The Economic Growth Act’s highlights include improving consumer access to mortgage credit, adding certain protections for consumers, including veterans and active duty military personnel, expanding credit freezes and creating an identity theft protection database. In addition, the federal banking agencies have issued a joint proposed rule whereby most qualifying community banking organizations with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, that meet risk-based qualifying criteria, and have a community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) of greater than 9 percent would be able to opt into a new community banking leverage ratio framework. Such a community banking organization would not be subject to other risk-based and leverage capital requirements (including the Basel III and Basel IV requirements) and would be considered to have met the well capitalized ratio requirements. The CBLR is determined by dividing a financial institution’s tangible equity capital by its average total consolidated assets. The proposed rule further describes what is included in tangible equity capital and average total consolidated assets. The Bank feels that should this rule be adopted in a substantially similar format to the proposed rule, it would greatly ease the process of determining the Bank’s capital requirements. 
Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us. In addition, the Economic Growth Act modifies several provisions in 
Page-9

the Dodd-Frank Act, but the modifications are subject to implementing regulations. Although the reforms primarily target systemically important financial service providers, the Dodd-Frank Act’s influence has impacted and is expected to continue to impact smaller institutions over time. We will continue to evaluate the effect of the Dodd-Frank Act; however, in many respects, the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act will not be fully known for years, and no current assurance may be given that the Dodd-Frank Act, or any other new legislative changes, will not have a negative impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the Company and the Bank.
Notice and Approval Requirements Related to Control 
Banking laws impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect "control" of an FDIC-insured depository institution. These laws include the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act. Among other things, these laws require regulatory filings by a shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect "control" of an FDIC-insured depository institution or bank holding company. The determination whether an investor "controls" a depository institution is based on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investment. As a general matter, a party is deemed to control a depository institution or other company if the party owns or controls 25% or more of any class of voting stock. Subject to rebuttal, a party may be presumed to control a depository institution or other company if the investor owns or controls 10% or more of any class of voting stock. Ownership by family members, affiliated parties, or parties acting in concert, is typically aggregated for these purposes. If a party's ownership of the Company were to exceed certain thresholds, the investor could be deemed to "control" the Company for regulatory purposes. This could subject the investor to regulatory filings or other regulatory consequences. 
In addition, except under limited circumstances, bank holding companies are prohibited from acquiring, without prior approval: 1) control of any other bank or bank holding company or all or substantially all the assets thereof; or 2) more than 5% of the voting shares of a bank or bank holding company that is not already a subsidiary. 
Incentive Compensation
The Dodd-Frank Act required federal bank regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. These regulations apply to institutions having at least $1 billion in total assets. In addition, regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. The agencies have not finalized regulations proposed in April 2016. If adopted, the proposed regulations could place limits on the manner in which we structure our executive compensation. 
The Federal Reserve reviews, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations. The Federal Reserve tailors their reviews for each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives are included in reports of examination. Deficiencies, if any, are incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
