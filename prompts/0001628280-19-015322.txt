Item 1.    Business.
The Board, Management, Internal Control and Reporting Improvements
As discussed in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, included in Part II, the Company’s management team has concluded that there were material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. All of the material weaknesses were previously reported in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Management is committed to the implementation of remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses. The remediation efforts summarized below, which have been or will be implemented, are intended both to address the identified material weaknesses and to enhance the Company’s overall internal control environment. These efforts include the following:

• | The Company appointed a new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in 2017 and a new Vice President, Internal Audit in 2018, with oversight from the Board of Directors (the “Board”) and the Audit Committee consisting of new members (since 2017);


• | The Company has updated its Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and has initiated an ongoing training program to help ensure that employees understand and comply with the Code.


• | The Company will continue to enhance the program to provide extensive communications and training to employees across the entire organization regarding the importance of integrity and accountability;


• | In addition to naming a new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company has either replaced or appointed personnel for critical accounting positions with certified public accountants who have the appropriate level of public-company experience, including, among others, a Corporate Controller, a Director of Accounting and a Director of Financial Reporting; and


• | The Company has developed and begun implementing a more comprehensive internal controls program along with a formal, enterprise-wide remediation plan, including detailed and prioritized action plans, owners and a phased timeline. This remediation plan is overseen by an executive Internal Control Steering Committee, and progress is communicated to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. The Internal Control Steering Committee of which the charter includes the following members: Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Vice President, Internal Audit, Chief Information Officer, Corporate Controller and Executive Vice President.

In light of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, prior to filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company completed substantive procedures, including extensive temporary manual procedures and other measures, as needed to assist with meeting the objectives otherwise fulfilled by effective internal control over financial reporting. These procedures included, but were not limited to, conducting additional analysis and implementing substantive measures. 
The Company also added additional human resources and retained outside consultants with relevant accounting experience, skills and knowledge, working under the Company’s supervision and direction to assist with the account closing and financial statement preparation process. These additional procedures have allowed the Company to conclude that, notwithstanding the material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, the consolidated financial statements included herein fairly present, in all material respects, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). 
When fully implemented and operational, the Company believes the measures, more fully described in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, included in Part II, will remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses it has identified and will strengthen its internal control over financial reporting. The Company is committed to continuing to improve its internal control processes, and reviews its financial reporting controls and procedures on an ongoing basis. As the Company continues to evaluate and work to improve its internal control over financial reporting, it may determine additional measures are needed to address control deficiencies or modify certain remediation measures.

Government Investigations
The SEC’s enforcement staff has been conducting an investigation focused on, among other things, the Company’s prior financial reporting, misapplication of U.S. GAAP, revenue recognition practices and related conduct, and accounting errors which resulted in the Company restating its 2014, 2015 and first quarter 2016 consolidated financial statements. In addition, the USAO has been conducting a parallel criminal investigation into these matters. The Company is fully cooperating with the SEC and the USAO in their investigations, and it cannot currently predict the ultimate outcome of those investigations. The outcome of such investigations could have a material adverse effect on the Company, the trading prices of its securities and its ability to raise additional capital. If the SEC or the USAO determines that the Company violated federal securities or other laws and institutes civil enforcement or criminal proceedings, the Company may become subject to civil or criminal sanctions, including, but not limited to, criminal or civil charges, fines, other monetary penalties, injunctive relief and compliance conditions imposed by a court or agreement, which may have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

Strategic Initiatives/Growth Strategies
The Company has initiated a comprehensive set of business objectives aimed at improving profitability, streamlining processes, strengthening the business and focusing on achieving growth in higher-return product lines. Key elements of these objectives and other initiatives are highlighted below.
Improve profitability
The Company has implemented a plan focused on enhancing profitability through the review of its customer and product portfolio. To date, this has resulted in strategic price increases in certain areas of the business, along with product redesign and the re-sourcing of certain components, to support improved margins. This program is a multi-year effort and will entail a strategic assessment of certain areas in which profitability does not meet established thresholds. The Company is also seeking opportunities to improve its profitability through the initiation of programs to improve manufacturing efficiency and working capital efficiency. It has also been investing heavily in the expansion of its heavy-duty engine product line, which has historically provided better margins. Further, the Company is in the early phases of production of certain products and anticipates potential benefits as it gains improved economies of scale through greater volumes. Lastly, since mid-2016, the Company incurred substantial costs related to its restatement of prior financial statements and remediation of its material weaknesses. The Company has seen a meaningful reduction in certain of these costs with the completion of the restatement of its prior financial statements in May 2019 and expects to see further reductions once it files delinquent periodic reports and remediates its material weaknesses.

Increased emphasis on energy product offerings through new product development and investments
The Company has been a major participant in the energy market for many years as a supplier to several of the world’s leading power generation companies and through its large custom genset enclosure business. Building on its broad product offering, in March 2018 and October 2018, the Company received EPA certification for its 32L and 40L heavy-duty engines, respectively, and has development and launch plans for a 53L model. These heavy-duty engines provide a natural-gas-fueled power range from 500 kilowatt-electric (“kWe”) to 1.25 megawatt (“MW”), which is well above the Company’s prior capabilities, allowing it to serve a greater portion of the demand response, microgrid, combined heat and power, and oil and gas markets. Additionally, in September 2019, the Company received EPA emergency standby certification for its 20L, 40L and 53L diesel engines, which provide a power range of 550 kWe to 1.65 MW. These diesel engines are largely designed for energy market applications including emergency power, wastewater treatment, and oil and gas exploration and production. Also, the engines can handle mission critical customer operations in the health care, data center, hospitality and transportation industries. In addition to dedicating significant R&D resources within the energy market, the Company has also strategically invested in expanding its management, sales and operations staff to support these efforts. The Company’s heavy-duty engines have historically provided better margins.
Capitalize on key market trends
The Company’s breadth of products and solutions will enable it to capitalize on numerous market trends that it believes have the potential to drive customer demand for its products and contribute toward its long-term growth. Further, the Company’s R&D activity is largely focused on expanding its solutions to further address trends in these areas. The key trends include the following:

• | The worldwide growth of intermittent sources of energy, such as wind and solar, and an aged electric grid in the United States, coupled with power outage activity due to weather or power shutdowns, which is driving increased demand for generators, microgrids and demand response equipment;


• | Increasingly stringent regulations and growing efforts to reduce emissions, which are driving demand for alternatives to diesel power engines (e.g., EPA Tier 4 emission standards, CARB regulations, MEE policies in China), in particular, in several markets such as the power generation market for oil and gas, school bus, arbor care and the China bus market, among others;


• | Growth in e-commerce activity around the world, which is driving demand for last-mile delivery vehicles; and


• | The availability of automotive engines that are suited for industrial application.

New product expansion by leveraging deep industry experience
Throughout the Company’s history, it has evolved from a provider of diesel power systems to become a major supplier of power systems fueled by alternatives to diesel, including gasoline, propane and natural gas, among others. By leveraging the deep industry experience of its engineering and new-product development teams, the Company is continuing to take steps to broaden the range of its power system product offerings, including engine classes, power ratings and the OEM and direct user market categories into which it supplies products. The Company plans to capitalize on its technologically sophisticated, in-house design, prototyping, testing and application engineering capabilities to further refine its superior power system technology.
Leverage the Company’s relationship with Weichai
In March 2017, the Company executed a share purchase agreement (the “SPA”) with Weichai America Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Weichai Power Co., Ltd. (HK2338, SZ000338) (herein collectively referred to as “Weichai”). Under the terms of the SPA, Weichai invested $60.0 million in the Company (the “Weichai Transaction”) by purchasing a combination of newly issued Common and Preferred Stock as well as a stock purchase warrant, which significantly strengthened the Company’s financial condition and contributed to the subsequent extinguishment of a $60.0 million term loan. The Company and Weichai also entered 
8

into a strategic collaboration agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) under which they have been working together to accelerate market opportunities for each company’s respective product lines across various geographic and end-user markets.
The Collaboration Agreement provides the Company with strategic benefits and opportunities, including the ability to leverage Weichai’s strengths and capabilities in R&D, manufacturing, procurement and distribution and its widespread sales channels in China and other emerging markets. This collaboration has already enabled the Company to broaden its existing product portfolio, improve material quality, decrease costs, accelerate the development of new products and bring them to market, and expand access and exposure to new markets.
Among other things, the Collaboration Agreement establishes a joint steering committee, permits Weichai to second a limited number of certain technical, marketing, sales, procurement and finance personnel to work at the Company and establishes several collaborations, including with respect to stationary natural gas applications and Weichai diesel engines. The Collaboration Agreement also provides for the steering committee to create different subcommittees with various operating roles, and it otherwise governs the treatment of intellectual property of the parties prior to the collaboration and the intellectual property developed during the collaboration. The Collaboration Agreement has a term of three years.
The Weichai stock purchase warrant, as last amended (the “Weichai Warrant”), was exercisable commencing on April 1, 2019 for such number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock as was sufficient to provide Weichai with majority ownership of the Company’s Common Stock. On April 23, 2019, Weichai exercised the Weichai Warrant resulting in the Company issuing 4,049,759 shares of the Company’s Common Stock (see Changes in Control section, included in Part III, Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters, for additional information). Weichai is currently the Company’s largest stockholder, holding 51.4% of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock as of December 2, 2019. 
Expand global business
Through the expansion of its product lineup and the entry into new markets, the Company has a history of growing its product offerings internationally beyond North America. The Company sees opportunity in continuing to grow its business worldwide with further R&D investment including new-product development and offerings.
Strengthened engine development and testing capability
In April 2018, the Company acquired the assets of Chicago Technical Center R&D facility from Ricardo, Inc. This transaction has allowed the Company to significantly strengthen and expand its testing capabilities and increase its capacity to meet current and future engine development, certification and durability testing needs. The advanced R&D facility immediately provided three strategic benefits for the corporate engine programs: (i) increased speed to market response, (ii) greater ability to innovate and optimize product performance and reliability, and (iii) lower cost of product development through direct control of in-house EPA and CARB-certified testing cell operations, scheduling and management of the industry-leading engine testing center.
Sales and Marketing
The Company employs a direct sales and marketing approach to maintain maximum interface with and service support for its OEM customers. This direct interface incorporates the corporate internal technical sales representatives. The Company complements its direct OEM relationships with a localized, independent sales and product support organization. This localized sales and support organization provides the necessary knowledge of local customs and requirements while also delivering immediate sales assistance and customer support.
The Company has invested in and is focused on capturing aftermarket sales of the value-added components that are included in its power systems. With a significant portion of the selling prices of the Company’s power systems coming from value-added components, this is a large, continuing growth opportunity for its aftermarket business.
Customers
The Company’s customers primarily include global OEMs and direct end users across a wide range of applications that demand high product quality, best-in-class engineering support and on-time delivery. Within several applications for which the Company provides solutions, it maintains supplier relationships with two or more customers, which are often among the largest in that category.
The Company’s largest customers, based upon its consolidated net sales in 2018, included Hyster-Yale Materials Handling Group and the following subsidiaries / affiliates of Daimler AG: Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation, Thomas Built Buses and FUSO Company (collectively, “Freightliner”). Hyster-Yale Materials Handling Group and Freightliner represented 15% and 11% of 2018 consolidated net sales, respectively. The largest customers change from time to time as a result of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, customers’ strategies and inventory of the Company’s power systems.

• | Customer support and service.

Manufacturing
The Company manufactures and assembles its products at facilities in suburban Chicago, Illinois, and Darien, Wisconsin, and customizes its power systems to meet specific requirements of OEM applications and the needs of its OEM customers. The Company has invested in precision computer numerical control (“CNC”) machining equipment to finish its internally designed engine blocks and cylinder heads, which are cast by various suppliers. The manufacturing lines in the Company’s production facilities are technologically sophisticated lean, agile and flexible, and the Company allocates production capacity on its mixed model manufacturing lines to accommodate the demand levels and product mix required by its OEM customers. 
The Company focuses on safety, people, quality, on-time delivery and cost in its manufacturing operations. The Company is certified to the most recent International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) standard, ISO 9001: 2015. The ISO 9000 family of quality management standards, which must be met in order to become ISO certified, is designed to help organizations monitor and improve the quality and delivery of their products and/or services to their customers. The Company also uses tools such as Six Sigma, Lean Manufacturing, 80/20, Value Stream Mapping and other manufacturing engineering strategies to help manage its business, build quality, and drive performance and a continuous improvement culture within the manufacturing operations’ teams. The Company also uses a customer relationship management database to help to collect customer feedback and to track overall quality performance at its OEM customers. Structured staff training is a constant priority and includes closed-loop quality monitoring and feedback systems.
Research, Development and Engineering
The Company’s research, development and engineering programs are focused on new product development, enhancements to current products, quality improvements and material cost reductions across its product lines. Its efforts are market driven, with the sales team identifying and defining market requirements and trends and its engineering and new-product development groups reviewing existing power system portfolios and developing new solutions that build upon the technology within that portfolio. To further enhance the Company's research, development and engineering programs, the Company finalized the purchase of emissions testing assets and the sublease of an emissions testing facility from Ricardo, Inc., a subsidiary of the strategic engineering and environmental consultancy, Ricardo Plc., for $5.6 million in cash in April 2018. See Note 4. Property, Plant and Equipment, and Leases in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Information for further discussion.
The Company’s product and application development engineering teams include in-house mechanical and electrical engineering functions. Internal resources are supplemented with engineering outsourcing relationships for design, development and product testing. In addition to these engineering outsourcing relationships, the Company benefits from the design, development and testing capabilities of its supplier base. The Company staffs its engineering support activities associated with released product and component sourcing programs with dedicated internal engineering personnel.
Research, development and engineering expenditures include salaries, contractor fees, building costs, utilities, testing, information technology and administrative expenses and are expensed, net of contract reimbursements, when incurred. From time to time, the Company enters into agreements with its customers to fund a portion of the research, development and engineering costs of a 
10

particular project. These reimbursements are accounted for as a reduction of the related Research, development and engineering expenditure. The Company’s research, development and engineering expenditures for 2018 and 2017 were $28.6 million and $19.9 million, respectively.
Supplier Relationships
In addition to producing its own engines, the Company has established relationships with its suppliers for certain engines that are integrated into its comprehensive power systems, the most significant of which are Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd. (“Doosan”), a subsidiary of Doosan Group, Shenyang Aerospace Mitsubishi Motors Engine Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (“SAME”), General Motors Company (“GM”) and Weichai. The Company also sources other power system components and coordinates design efforts with third-party suppliers for some of its key components. In general, the prices at which the Company purchases engines, components and other raw materials are based on market factors, including the prices offered by other suppliers operating in the same market and the prevailing market prices of raw materials. 
The Company aggregates product sourcing efforts across its large and diverse OEM customer base and across industry categories, capitalizing on volume, economies of scale and global supply opportunities. The Company’s customers benefit from the aggregation of its global sourcing, procurement, and assembly and services, obtaining cost benefits that they might not obtain if they were to rely on their own internal resources, capabilities and more limited demand requirements. Through this process, customers are able to streamline their supply base by consolidating procurement and assembly efforts down to a single part number product supplied by the Company. The Company delivers this assembly to its customer’s production line ready to install into the customers’ product.
The Company is party to a supply agreement with Doosan, under which it purchases and distributes, on an exclusive basis, specified Doosan engines within a territory consisting of the United States, Canada and Mexico. On October 1, 2019, the supply agreement with Doosan was amended and extended to December 31, 2023, after which the agreement will automatically be extended for additional one-year terms unless a notice of termination is provided by either party six months prior to the scheduled expiration. The addendum also includes minimum product purchase commitments for the period 2019 through 2023, subject to reductions based on market declines in oil prices and defined prescribed payments to Doosan triggered by shortfalls in purchases made by the Company during each annual calendar period.
The Company is also party to a supply agreement with GM through December 31, 2019 for the exclusive purchase and distribution of the 6.0L engine to OEMs for usage in the on-road market, which includes the Company’s sale of this engine to its customer, Freightliner. With the GM announcement that it will discontinue its production of the 6.0L engine, the Company has been conducting last time buys of this engine to ensure adequate supply to Freightliner and other customers. The Company does not have a supply agreement with GM for its successor product to the 6.0L engine. However, it is actively exploring opportunities to identify engine alternatives for this product.
The Company is also party to a supply agreement with SAME through December 31, 2019 for the exclusive purchase and distribution of engines around the world, with the exception of China (including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan), within the forklift and marine markets. The agreement, which automatically extends for an additional one-year term on an annual basis, unless either party provides notice of termination at least 180 days before the expiration date, includes minimum purchase commitments.
Product Support
The Company’s dedicated team of product and application engineers enables it to deliver high-quality, responsive technical support to its OEM and end-user customers. The Company provides technical support and training to its customers, including in-plant training and support through web- and phone-based field service. The Company further supports its customers by engaging regional providers to perform warranty services and offer support for its power systems. The Company also leverages its technical resources to provide service and support functions for its power systems sold to OEM customers.
Backlog
Backlog generally is not considered a significant factor in the Company’s business.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s workforce consisted of approximately 1,100 full-time employees. None of the members of the Company’s workforce are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
Impact of Government Regulation
The Company’s power systems are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing exhaust emissions, evaporative emissions, greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and noise. The Company’s power systems are subject to compliance with regulatory standards imposed by the EPA, state regulatory agencies in the United States, including the CARB, and other regulatory agencies around the world, such as the MEE. Since its engines are sold into both off-road and on-road markets, the Company must ensure certification to the specific regulations within the applicable statutory segment. For products sold into the U.S. market, both EPA and CARB have imposed specific regulations on engines used in both 
11

off-road equipment and on-road vehicles. These regulations generally serve to restrict exhaust emissions, with a primary focus on oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Exhaust emission regulations for engines used in off-highway industrial and power generation equipment vary based upon the use of the equipment into which the engine is incorporated (such as stationary power generation or mobile off-highway industrial equipment) and the type of fuel used to drive the power system. Similarly, on-road regulations from the EPA and CARB focus on the same exhaust constituents as well as sophisticated requirements to meet on-board diagnostic (“OBD”) system regulations. Emissions of GHGs such as carbon dioxide (“CO2”), methane and nitrogen dioxide (“NO2”) are also regulated, with more stringent regulatory requirements starting in 2021. The Company continues to make significant investments into the necessary intellectual property that supports full compliance of the Company’s engines now and into the foreseeable future.
The first EPA emissions regulations adopted for diesel engines, known as Tier 1, applied to diesel engines used in mobile off-highway applications in the U.S., and similar standards for diesel engines, known as Stage I regulations, were implemented thereafter in the EU. The EPA and applicable agencies in the EU have continued to develop emissions regulations for diesel engines in the U.S. and the EU, respectively, and have adopted more restrictive standards. The current diesel engine emission requirements in the U.S are known as Tier 4 and are applicable to off-road diesel engines used in industrial equipment. Similarly, the EU has adopted more restrictive standards under its Stage V regulations. Tier 4 and Stage V regulations call for reductions in levels of particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen.
The Company’s entry into the transportation end market began in 2013 with the development of its 8.8L power systems targeted for 2015 regulatory standards. In 2014, the EPA and CARB certified the Company’s new engine as a Model Year 2015 product for liquid propane gas (“LPG”) and compressed natural gas (“CNG”) fuels, and in 2015 the Company launched its first propane-fueled engine for on-road applications. To assist the adoption of alternative-fueled vehicles in the marketplace, the EPA and CARB granted alternative-fueled engines an exemption from OBD regulations until 2018 (CARB)/2019 (EPA). The Company has leveraged this exemption on its 8.8L certifications to date. Gasoline engines are not exempt from OBD regulations, therefore, in 2017, the Company achieved full OBD certification for its 2018 and beyond gasoline 6.0L and 8.8L products. The knowledge gained from this gasoline OBD development is being applied to the Company’s alternative-fueled engines for 2019 after all OBD exemptions ended as of December 31, 2018. In 2016, the EPA launched new Phase 1 GHG emission regulations. The Company’s products currently qualify for an exemption for Phase 1 GHG under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulation Section 1036.150(d). Starting in 2020, the Company’s engines will need to meet Phase 1 GHG standards as a result of the Weichai ownership change in 2019 as the Company’s products will no longer qualify for the exemption. The Company has developed a plan to address the impact of the regulation requirements. New EPA Phase 2 GHG regulations will start in 2021 and the Company’s engines will need to meet Phase 2 GHG standards.
The initial and ongoing certification requirements vary by power system application and market segment. Each application must undergo a series of rigorous and demanding tests to demonstrate compliance with regulatory standards, including useful life, zero hours and durability testing. Once a power system is certified, regulatory agencies impose ongoing compliance requirements, which include testing newly produced power systems on a regular quarterly schedule to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable regulations. In addition, there are field audit requirements, which require the removal of power systems from service at specified stages of their useful lives to perform confirmatory exhaust emissions testing and/or OBD system audits and testing. All of the Company’s emission-certified power systems meet existing exhaust emission standards of the EPA and CARB. Failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on the Company’s future financial results.
