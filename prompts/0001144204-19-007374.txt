ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
The Company is a specialty health sciences company formed to develop, formulate and distribute condition-specific medical foods with an initial medical food product on the market under the brand name Lumega-Z® that replenishes and restores the macular protective pigment. A depleted macular protective pigment is a modifiable risk factor for retina-based diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (“AMD”), computer vision syndrome (“CVS”) and diabetic retinopathy. The Company believes this risk may be modified by taking Lumega-Z to maintain a healthy macular protective pigment. Additional research has also shown a depleted macular protective pigment to be a biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.
 
In September 2017, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary VectorVision Ocular Health, Inc., acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of VectorVision, Inc., a company that specializes in the standardization of contrast sensitivity, glare sensitivity, low contrast acuity, and early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (“ETDRS”) visual acuity testing. VectorVision’s standardization system is designed to provide the practitioner or researcher with the ability to delineate very small changes in visual capability, either as compared to the population or from visit to visit. VectorVision develops, manufactures and sells equipment and supplies for standardized vision testing for use by eye doctors in clinical trials, for real-world vision evaluation, and industrial vision testing. The acquisition expands the Company’s technical portfolio. The Company believes the acquisition of VectorVision, adding the CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 to its product portfolio, further establishes its position at the forefront of early detection, intervention and monitoring of a range of eye diseases. The Company has had limited commercial operations to date. Until recently with the acquisition of VectorVision and development of the Company’s sales force, the Company has primarily been engaged in research, development, commercialization, and capital raising.
 
The Company invented a proprietary technology, embodied in the Company’s medical device, the MapcatSF,® that accurately measures the macular pigment optical density (“MPOD”). On November 8, 2016, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued patent number 9,486,136 for the MapcatSF invention. Using the MapcatSF to measure the MPOD allows one to monitor the increase in the density of the macular protective pigment after taking Lumega-Z. The MapcatSF is a non-mydriatic, non-invasive device that accurately measures the MPOD, the lens optical density and lens equivalent age, thereby creating an evidence-based protocol that is shared with the patient. A non-mydriatic device is one that does not require dilation of the pupil for it to function. The MapcatSF is the first medical device using a patented “single fixation” process and “automatic lens density correction” that produces accurate serialized data.
 
For the past three years, the clinical prototypes of the MapcatSF have been tested on patients, allowing for frequent modifications of the device’s algorithms and retesting for accuracy, as well as to provide the inclusion of additional features not previously found in the initial prototype. The alpha prototype, which is the pre-commercial production version, was unveiled for the first time in July 2013 in Cambridge, United Kingdom, to researchers and scientists from around the world. The MapcatSF is manufactured and assembled in Irvine, California, and will be distributed from the Company’s national headquarters in San Diego. The marketing of the device will be implemented through continuing education presentations conducted by key opinion leaders in the industry. The MapcatSF device is a Class I medical device under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) classification scheme for medical devices, which the Company has determined does not require pre-market approval.
 
Lumega-Z is a medical food product that has a patent-pending formula that replenishes and restores the macular protective pigment simultaneously delivering critical and essential nutrients to the eye. Management believes, based on review of products on the market and knowledge of the industry, that Lumega-Z is the first liquid ocular health formula to be classified as a medical food (as defined in Section 5(b) of the “Orphan Drug Act”). However, the FDA has not monitored nor approved Lumega-Z as a medical food. Formulated by Dr. Sheldon Hendler in 2010, modifications were made over a two-year period to improve the taste and method of delivery. The current formulation has been delivered to patients and used in clinics since 2014.
 
Medical foods are not considered to be either dietary or nutritional supplements. The Company believes that there is an increasing level of acceptance of medical foods as a primary therapy by patients and healthcare providers to treat pain syndromes, sleep and cognitive disorders, obesity, hypertension, and viral infection. In clinical practice, medical foods are being prescribed as both a standalone therapy and as an adjunct therapy to low doses of commonly prescribed drugs. The Company believes that medical foods will continue to grow in importance over the coming years.
 
Lumega-Z is a regulated medical food and therefore must be administered under the supervision of a physician or professional healthcare provider. In order to reach the large, expanding AMD patient population, the Company primarily markets Lumega-Z to patients through ophthalmologists and optometrists.

Over 1,900 patients have been treated with Lumega-Z since the Company began selling the formulation in October 2011. The patients come from a combination of the three initial testing sites, healthcare provider sites where the MapcatSF has been demonstrated, patients that have found Lumega-Z online and through other patient referrals, healthcare provider sites administering Lumega-Z to their patients without use of the MapcatSF, and MapcatSF devices recently placed in additional healthcare facilities. Patients take Lumega-Z under the supervision of their physician. Lumega-Z is typically ingested by the patient on a daily basis. Patients are typically between 50 and 80 years old. Patients are mixed ethnically and socioeconomically. Patients typically have insurance, whether private insurance or Medicare. Physicians have determined that the patient is experiencing or is at a high risk of developing retinal disease and decide based on their medical determination that the patient is a candidate for Lumega-Z.
 
Nearly half of Americans have low MPOD, a risk factor for AMD. As the MapcatSF is specifically designed to measure the MPOD, the Company and the physicians that utilize the MapcatSF are able to observe changes in that macular protective pigment density in patients who are taking Lumega-Z. The Company encourages sites using the MapcatSF® to provide the Company anonymized data on the MPOD readings. Anecdotal reports from physicians indicate improvements in their patients such as increased visual function, a noticeable halt in the progression of the patient’s AMD, improvement in glare and contrast sensitivity, and stabilization and improvement of vision. No adverse effects of taking Lumega-Z have been reported by any of the physicians administering Lumega-Z to their patients.
 
The number of patients regularly ordering Lumega-Z has increased as new healthcare providers have begun working with the Company, with a concurrent rise in patients set on an auto-ship program for delivery every four weeks. Automatic shipment has an added benefit in that it aids physicians because it increases patient compliance in using Lumega-Z on a regular basis. The Company’s operations, to date, indicate that each MapcatSF deployed in a clinic can generate an average of 75 new customers for its Lumega-Z product over a period of approximately 90 days when a MapcatSF is deployed in a small, low volume clinic. A larger, higher volume clinic is expected to generate a larger number of patients in a shorter period of time. All of the Company’s medical food revenue is derived from a limited number of individual customers.
 
The National Academics of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine projects that “every four minutes, one American will experience partial or complete loss of sight.” According to The Lancet, AMD cases in the US are projected to pass 18 million in 2017, and 20 million by 2022. AMD is the third leading cause of blindness in the world. More than 10 million people in the United States suffer from various forms of this incurable disease, according to the American Macular Degeneration Foundation. As the population ages, that number is expected to triple by 2025. Cataract patients are operated on earlier and younger. After surgery, the long-term damage from oxidative stress & high energy light exposure to the retina becomes more important to address. Protecting the retina after surgery maintains better visual outcomes for the long term. GHS is targeting this unattended market opportunity. Congress, the Food and Drug Administration, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services and private insurance companies are focusing increased efforts on pharmacovigilance (the branch of the pharmaceutical industry which assesses and monitors the safety of drugs either in the development pipeline or which have already been approved for marketing) to measure and reduce these adverse health consequences.
 
The Company believes that there is an increasing level of acceptance of medical foods as a primary therapy by patients and healthcare providers to treat pain syndromes, sleep and cognitive disorders, obesity, hypertension, and viral infection. In clinical practice, medical foods are being prescribed as both a standalone therapy and as an adjunct therapy to low doses of commonly prescribed drugs. From a regulatory standpoint, the FDA took steps in 1988 to encourage the development of medical foods by regulating this product category under the Orphan Drug Act. The term “medical food” as defined in Section 5(b) of the Orphan Drug Act is a “food which is formulated to be consumed or administered internally (by mouth) under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation.” This definition was incorporated by reference into the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990.
 
These regulatory changes have reduced the costs and time associated with bringing medical foods to market. Until 1972, medical foods were categorized as drugs and then until 1988 as “foods for special dietary purposes.” The field of candidates for development into medical foods is expanding due to continuing advances in the understanding of the science of nutrition and disease, coupled with advances in food technology thereby increasing the number of products that can be formulated and commercialized.
 
The Company distributes its medical food products through E-commerce in an online store that is operated at www.guardionhealth.com. Information about VectorVision products can be found at www.vectorvision.com.
 
Medical Foods Products Industry Overview
 
The Company believes that the science of nutrition was long overlooked and underdeveloped. The Company believes that the sick and elderly have special nutritional needs that cannot be met by traditional adult diets. Medical nutrition has emerged as a large and attractive segment in the food industry today.

A number of diseases are associated with metabolic imbalances, and patients in treatment for such diseases have specific nutritional requirements. Some examples are ocular health, pain syndromes, insomnia, cognitive disorders, IBS, and heart disease. Many older Americans have or will develop chronic diseases that are amenable to the dietary management benefits of medical foods. Medical foods help address these diseases and conditions in a drug-free way with food-based ingredients yet are still considered a medical product that should be taken under supervision by a physician. The term “medical foods” does not pertain to all foods fed to sick patients. Medical foods are foods that are specially formulated and processed (as opposed to a naturally occurring foodstuff used in a natural state) for patients who are seriously ill or who require the product as a major treatment modality according to FDA regulations.
 
Medical foods consist of food-based ingredients that are part of the normal human diet and are Generally Recognized as Safe (“GRAS”) under FDA standards. Medical foods must make disease claims for which there is scientific evidence that nutrient deficiencies cannot be corrected by normal diet. Medical foods are intended for a vulnerable population suffering from a particular chronic disease and therefor have special, extra-rigorous guarantees of safety. All ingredients must be designated GRAS and used in therapeutic concentrations to address the particular nutritional needs of the patient. Medical foods are taken under the supervision of a physician or professional healthcare provider who monitors and adjusts the food ‘dosage.’ In addition, under FDA guidelines and congressionally approved laws, medical foods do not require FDA preapproval but undergo continuous FDA monitoring and approval of label claims. Even though pre-market FDA approval is not required for a medical food, the official requirements and responsibilities for the manufacturer, in terms of safety, are greater than for dietary supplements, including solid scientific support for the formula as a whole. For these reasons, medical foods have greater guarantees of efficacy. In contradistinction, dietary supplements, such as vitamins, minerals and botanicals, do not require FDA preapproval, cannot make disease claims, are intended for normal people without disease and cannot claim that they prevent, mitigate or treat a given disease. Dietary supplements do not require physician supervision and can be administered to a person that can self-administer the supplement without supervision.
 
Based on the advice of intellectual property counsel and regulatory affairs consultants, the Company believes that Lumega-Z is properly categorized as a medical food. While the Company believes it is unlikely the FDA would conclude otherwise, if the FDA determines Lumega-Z should not be defined as a medical food, the Company would need to relabel and rebrand that product. The Company believes there would be minimal impact on its operations and financial condition if it were required to change labeling and packaging back to that of a dietary supplement. While reclassification and the subsequent relabeling and rebranding would be an added cost to operations, it would not change the use or effectiveness of Lumega-Z, although there is a chance that certain physicians may choose not to recommend Lumega-Z to their patients or that certain consumers may choose not to buy Lumega-Z if it is not classified as a medical food.
 
 Vision Testing Industry Overview
 
The Company believes that consistent, repeatable and accurate results for visual acuity testing are of paramount importance for effective eye health care and for accurately establishing and enforcing the vision performance criteria for certain professions. Variance in test lighting is a major cause of inconsistency in vision testing results. Standards for testing luminance, have been in place for more than three decades. However, recently, vision testing has evolved from the use of projection systems and charts to the use of digital displays. The Company believes that the variance in luminance provided by digital displays is large, and clinicians are now obtaining highly inconsistent results from practice to practice. Conservatively, the Company believes more than 250,000 eye care examination rooms are in use in the United States today.
 
The variability described above has caused the FDA and other agencies to require standardized test lighting for vision tests. Because VectorVision specializes in the standardization of vision tests, VectorVision is the only company that offers fully standardized vision testing products that ensure consistent, repeatable and highly accurate results. The CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 devices offer auto-calibrated tests to ensure the correct testing luminance and contrast levels for consistent, highly accurate and repeatable results, which is why the VectorVision instruments can detect and quantify subtle changes in vision. Consistency, repeatability and accuracy are also why the VectorVision CSV-1000 instrument is used worldwide by eye doctors in more than 60 countries to accomplish contrast sensitivity testing. For the same reasons, the Company believes that the ESV-3000 ETDRS testing device will become the worldwide standard for ETDRS visual acuity testing. The Company’s research has revealed no competing products that offers auto-calibration of ambient illumination. Competitive devices do not allow for variations in ambient light levels, resulting in variability of test results due to the environment in which the testing is performed. The CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 use self-calibrated test lighting. The self-calibrated test lighting is proprietary, and the test faces of the CSV-1000 are proprietary and the intellectual property is protected under copyright and trade secret law. Both CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 are currently sold worldwide, and the Company expects this global distribution to continue. There is a training requirement in incorporating the CSV-1000 device into clinical practice, which the Company plans to provide as part of its commercialization strategy.
 
Competitive Advantage and Strategy
 
There are no research-validated pharmaceutical solutions for slowing the progression of adult macular degeneration (“AMD”). As a result, it is necessary for physicians to recommend Age-Related Eye Disease Study (“AREDS”)-based supplements to AREDS-based AMD patients. However, more than 90% of all AREDS-based nutritional products currently on the market are in tablet, capsule and gel capsule form. As previously discussed, tablets, capsules and gel capsules have a low efficiency of absorption. For this reason, some doctors may hesitate to prescribe tablet, capsule and gel capsule form AREDS-based nutraceuticals despite the fact that these are currently the only options available to them.

The competitive landscape of supplements is crowded and confusing for physicians and patients looking to obtain an appropriate product for eye care. In October 2017, while searching walgreens.com for “AREDS,” the Company found 10 results, all of which are in tablet, capsule or gel capsule form. When searching the same website for “Eye Health Supplements” (a common search term for this category of product), the Company found 204 products, of which 196 (96%) are in tablet, capsule or gel capsule form. The same search term on cvs.com returned over 110 products. These supplement products all have varying ingredients, varying levels of similar ingredients, varying claims regarding their effects, and varying price points.
 
Lumega-Z is designed to address this concern. In contrast, Lumega-Z is a liquid formulated using a proprietary molecular micronization process (“MMP”) to maximize efficiency of absorption and safety and to minimize compatibility issues. The MMP is a proprietary homogenization process whereby the molecular structure of the ingredients is reduced in size to facilitate more efficient absorption in the body.
 
By combining the MapcatSF medical device, the newly acquired VectorVision standardized vision testing technology and Lumega-Z medical food, the Company has developed, based on Management’s knowledge of the industry, what it believes to be the only reliable three-pronged, evidence-based protocol for replenishing and restoring the macular protective pigment, increasing overall retinal health and measuring the related improvements in visual function. The MapcatSF is the first medical device to use a patented “single fixation” process and “automatic lens density correction” that produces accurate serialized data. Historically, a number of specialized densometers used by research groups within the medical community have been known to produce unreliable data; due in part to the fact that they are not Troxler-free. The Troxler effect is an optical illusion affecting visual perception where an unchanging stimulus away from a fixation point will fade away and disappear as one stares at a fixation point consistently. A device that is Troxler-free does not have this fading of images that otherwise would occur as a result of the Troxler effect. Being Troxler-free is thought to be an important function in being able to accurately complete the testing using these devices.
 
The MapcatSF has been installed in several teaching and ocular research facilities, such as the Illinois College of Optometry (“ICO”), the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, and the Rosenberg School of Optometry at the University of the Immaculate Word. While these collaborative relationships help further validate the MapcatSF and Lumega-Z, these relationships are not material to the Company because none of these relationships is exclusive. There are many potential collaborative partners available. The Company is free to enter into other collaborative relationships as needed. No sales of Lumega-Z are generated directly from Illinois College of Optometry because the MapcatSF is part of its teaching curriculum and not used for direct patient care. However, the other collaborative partners, as a result of using the MapcatSF on patients, periodically put patients on Lumega-Z if a physician determines it appropriate to do so. The majority of sales of Lumega-Z primarily come from clinicians outside of these collaborative relationships.
 
VectorVision specializes in the standardization of vision tests, specifically, contrast sensitivity, glare testing and early treatment diabetic retinopathy study, or ETDRS, acuity. The variability in test lighting has caused the FDA and other agencies to require standardized test lighting for vision tests. Contrast sensitivity testing measures how people see in the real world. A depleted macular pigment greatly affects contrast sensitivity. Research suggests that contrast sensitivity is a better measure than standard acuity tests for real-world vision applications such as military pilots and highway driving. The Company believes that VectorVision is the only company that offers fully standardized vision testing products that ensure consistent, repeatable and highly accurate results. These qualities are why the VectorVision instruments can detect and quantify subtle changes in vision, and why the VectorVision CSV-1000 instrument is used worldwide by eye doctors in more than 60 countries to accomplish contrast sensitivity testing. On July 10, 2018, the USPTO issued US Patent No. 10,016,128, titled Method and Apparatus for Visual Acuity Testing. This patent describes an invention pertaining to automatic light calibration of the display screens used for vision testing. The Company owns this patent, and its VectorVision CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 devices each embody this invention. On July 17, 2018, the USPTO issued US Patent No. 10,022,045, also titled Method and Apparatus for Visual Acuity Testing, which describes a methodology to continuously calibrate display monitors to automatically hold display luminance constant for vision testing. This second patent also covers a methodology to compensate for other testing factors, such as room illumination and when patients view the vision test through a mirror, which is a common practice in eye doctors’ offices worldwide. The Company also owns this patent, and its VectorVision CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 devices each embody this invention.
 
The Company believes the CSV-1000 is the standard of care for clinical practice. There is a training requirement in incorporating the CSV-1000 device into clinical practice, which the Company plans to provide as part of its commercialization strategy.
 
Similarly, the Company believes that its ESV-3000 device will become the worldwide standard for ETDRS visual acuity testing. The CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 use self-calibrated test lighting. The self-calibrated test lighting is proprietary, and the test faces of the CSV-1000 are proprietary and protected intellectual property. Both CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 are currently sold worldwide, and the Company expects this global distribution to continue. The Company believes the acquisition of VectorVision, adding the CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 to its product portfolio, further establishes its position at the forefront of early detection, intervention and monitoring of a range of eye diseases.

An important part of the Company’s competitive strategy lies in combining Lumega-Z with technology to demonstrate its effects.  The Company’s proprietary MapcatSF medical device measures MOPD, thereby showing changes in macular pigment density from the use of Lumega-Z. In addition, the VectorVision CSV-1000 provides a second opportunity to baseline the vision of patients, and monitor changes in vision performance over time while administering Lumega-Z.  The VectorVision CSV-1000 is a highly accurate means of measuring and monitoring contrast sensitivity, a vision performance parameter that can be improved by increasing the level of macular pigment in the eye.
 
Growth Strategy
 
The Company believes that marketing its products is critical in ensuring its success. The Company has several marketing initiatives and will implement them according to the success and product feedback that the Company and products create. The Company will also consider acquiring other companies, product lines and intellectual property that may be complementary or supplementary as part of its future efforts to expand the business, which acquisitions could be for cash, stock or a combination thereof.
 
Management believes that there is a significant unmet need in everyday clinical practice to provide a vision assessment protocol that improves upon the current standard of visual acuity. Contrast sensitivity with the VectorVision CSV-1000 is a highly sensitive and repeatable method of measuring vision performance and can be utilized to monitor the vision performance of patients undergoing treatment with Lumega-Z, as well as for the general patient population. The CSV-1000 is currently the worldwide standard for contrast sensitivity testing in clinical trials, and there is a growing understanding of the importance of contrast sensitivity in general clinical practice. The Company’s intention is to penetrate the market by promotion of the CSV-1000 as the leading contrast sensitivity device available. The Company believes it can grow its business using the following sales and marketing strategies:
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Based on management’s knowledge of the industry, the Company believes that Lumega-Z is the only medical food in the ocular health space. The most analogous products on the market are dietary supplements. While the medical food category is well established and growing for certain diseases or disorders (for example, inborn errors of metabolism, metabolic syndrome, gastrointestinal disorders, and neurological disorders), there are currently no medical foods other than Lumega-Z specifically addressing ocular health. Thus, with regard to the ocular health market no such data is available regarding medical foods. The most comparable industry is dietary supplements. In an attempt to effectively illustrate the market potential for Lumega-Z, the Company has examined ocular health products in the dietary supplement market as the closest appropriate data set available. The use of dietary supplements to enhance health and well-being is a longstanding and increasing trend. According to industry sources, up to 52% of adults in the United States have reported taking nutritional supplements. Worldwide sales of supplements surpassed $132 billion in 2016. Supplementation has recently generated much interest among health professionals in a relatively new area, the prevention and slowing of the AMD epidemic.

Due to an aging population, the AMD, Glaucoma and Cognitive Decline epidemics are global and growing, creating a significant market for the Company’s products.
 
Marketing Lumega-Z to Practitioners
 
In order to reach the large, expanding AMD patient population, the Company will primarily market Lumega-Z to the patients through ophthalmologists and optometrists. In the U.S. alone, there are more than 18,515 ophthalmologists and over 34,000 optometrists currently practicing. There are over 213,000 ophthalmologists worldwide. This marketing reach will be achieved through a combination of collaboration with industry-specific publishers, peer-to-peer promotion using key opinion leader clinicians, organic and paid search engine optimization and marketing, and other content-driven & educational approaches.
 
Marketing the CSV-1000 to Practitioners
 
Contrast sensitivity is currently one of the standard tests for clinical trials relating to ocular surgeries and treatments, and the CSV-1000 is considered the benchmark for these applications. In addition, there is an increasing need for functional vision assessment in everyday clinical practice, as a means of measuring the effect of disorders such as cataract and macular degeneration on the patient’s functional vision, and the impact of treatment of these conditions on the patient’s vision. The Company will concentrate its efforts on increasing the use of contrast sensitivity in everyday clinical practice, as a means of targeting the optometry and ophthalmology markets, which consists of over 34,000 and over 18,000 doctors, respectively, in the United States.
 
Sales Channel
 
Lumega-Z is a regulated medical food and therefore must be administered under the supervision of a physician or professional healthcare provider. Once the healthcare provider has determined that the patient requires Lumega-Z, they follow the following procedures:

● | The Company provides all clinicians a DAC number (Doctor Authorization Code).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patients are given a customized recommendation from the clinician, including the DAC number; this enables patients to order Lumega-Z either online or by calling the 800 number.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patients are able to use their Health Care Flexible Spending Accounts (“FSA”) or Health Savings Account (“HSA”) dollars to pay for Lumega-Z.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company will support the clinicians by making available Online Ocular Nutrition courses to train their technicians.
 
Sales Force
 
The Company hired and trained a direct sales force in March 2018 consisting of a field-based team of account managers located in key geographical locations based on high population density areas with demographics that match the Company’s target markets. Each account manager is responsible for a defined geographical area and is expected to travel extensively to support the needs of customers. The account managers are tasked with prospecting for new accounts, closing leads generated by the Company’s marketing efforts, and generating revenue through account management activities including physician and staff training, and implementation of patient education resources. The account managers are expected to participate in national and regional trade shows and events, including supporting professional optometric and ophthalmological societies at a state level. Each account manager is assigned a quota that includes units of Lumega-Z sold, as well as sales of the MapcatSF, CSV-1000 and ESV-3000. Commissions are paid based on performance and achievement of quota.
International Expansion Strategy
 
Retinal diseases that include macular degeneration, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy are not exclusive to the United States. The Company believes there is great interest internationally to find non-pharmacologic treatments for these diseases. The largest market opportunity is China where some of these diseases are at substantial levels. The Company intends to explore opportunities and channels to enter this expansive market.

Transcranial Doppler Solutions
 
In August 2018, the Company created a wholly owned subsidiary, Transcranial Doppler Solutions, Inc. (“TDSI”), to further the Company’s position at the forefront of early detection, intervention and monitoring of a range of eye diseases.  TDSI will be dedicated to the pursuit of early predictors resulting in, the Company believes valuable therapeutic intervention for practitioners and their patients, and additional revenues stream generated from the testing and sale of Company products to appropriate customers.  TDSI will provide a service that makes TCD (as defined below) testing convenient by being in various medical facilities. A Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (“TCD”) has been accepted as a safe, non-invasive, and lower-cost technique that uses a low-frequency transducer probe to assess intracerebral blood flow, within the brain and to the eyes. Studies have shown the ability of TCD to predict stroke risks as well as other potential cardiovascular events. TCD also plays an important role in detecting changes in the ophthalmic artery blood flow, which is important to help evaluate the course of common eye disorders. Blood velocities and intensities can be measured using TCD, which provides an effective way to determine more accurately the state of pathology in early stages of common eye disorders such as glaucoma and other eye diseases that cause visual field defects.  Published medical resources indicate a strong relationship between ocular circulation and visual function in patients with glaucoma, diabetes, and macular disease, which are the three leading causes of acquired irreversible blindness throughout the world.  A TCD is also highly repeatable, the results of which provide an effective tool for ophthalmologists to treat their patients. Through the monitoring of blood flow in the intracranial vessels, including the ophthalmic artery, the TCD results will in turn provide an evidence-based protocol for Guardion’s medical foods, including the Company’s soon to be released new GlaucoCetinTM product. The Company is currently setting up the operations of TDSI and hopes to launch its services in upcoming quarters.

The MapcatSF® patent, Patent 9,486,136, describes an apparatus for use in the measurement of the optical density of the macular protective pigment in the human eye, as well as an apparatus for the use in measuring the lens optical density of a human eye. The apparatus is particularly applicable to flicker photometers, which are used to measure the macular protective pigment in the human eye. The foreign counterpart patent applications describe the same invention.
 
Prior to the issuance of US Patent No. 9,486,136, the Company filed a continuation application, Patent Application 15/346,010, covering new embodiments around the MapcatSF® device. These new embodiments contain improvements related to the accuracy of intensity measurements made with the device, as well as updated features around photodiode detector calibrations.
 
The Lumega-Z® patent filing, Patent Application 14/028,104, describes a daily liquid supplement for ocular and body health containing at least one of the following: lutein, zeaxanthin, meso-zeaxanthin and astaxanthin for a human subject and for nutritionally supplementing macular pigments in the human eye. The micronized nutrients in a lipid-based emulsion described in the patent application are more efficiently absorbed into the bloodstream than conventional supplement formulations resulting in higher serum levels and increased macular protective pigment.
 
Patent 10,016,128 describes a methodology to calibrate display monitors to automatically hold display luminance constant for vision testing. The method includes a measurement device that is placed on the peripheral areas of the display monitor and feedback software to communicate with a computer and automatically control display luminance. Manual control of luminance based on the output of the measurement device is also included. This invention is embodied in the CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 devices.
 
Patent 10,022,045 describes a methodology to continuously calibrate display monitors to automatically hold display luminance constant for vision testing. The method includes a measurement device that is placed on the peripheral areas of the display monitor and feedback software to communicate with a computer and automatically control display luminance. Manual control of luminance based on the output of the measurement device is also included. Calibration of the luminance provided by mirrors, if patients view the display monitors through mirrors, is also embodied in the invention. This invention is also embodied in the CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 devices.
 
Trade Secrets
 
The MapcatSF® device employs a proprietary algorithm for correcting macular pigment optical density measurements with respect to lens density effects.  More particularly, the proprietary algorithm adjusts the photopic luminosity function for the age equivalence of the subject’s lens using a relationship disclosed by Sagawa and Takahashi (J. Opt. Soc. Am. 18, 2659-2667).  The algorithm is embedded in an integrated circuit block designed in such a way as to make it difficult to reverse engineer.
 
VectorVision’s CSV-1000 has proprietary testing charts that are not only copyright protected but can only be reproduced accurately by using special lithographs. These lithographs are kept secure, with very limited access, and are closely guarded trade secrets.

Medical Foods and Medical Device Manufacturing and Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
The Company outsources the manufacturing of its medical food products and medical devices to contract manufacturers. The Company processes orders through purchase orders and invoices with each manufacturer. The Company believes that there are multiple alternative sources, suppliers and manufacturers available for its products and devices in the event of a termination or a disagreement with any current vendor.
Government Regulation
 
Medical Food Statutory Definition and One FDA Regulation
 
Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (“FDCA”), products are regulated on the basis of their intended use. Their intended use is determined by the objective factors surrounding their use. Numerous categories and subcategories of products exist under the FDCA that could relate to the Company’s products, such as food, food additive, dietary supplement, GRAS food component, new drug, GRAS and Effective (“GRAS/E”) drug for over the counter use, and GRAS/E drug for use under the supervision of a physician. The categories overlap and products can fall within more than one category depending on their intended use.
 
The FDA has provided little guidance on the regulation of medical foods, as it is still a relatively new and evolving category of product under the FDCA.
 
The Company’s medical food products are defined and regulated by the FDA. The term medical food is a “food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally, or by mouth, under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation.” The FDA advises that it considers the statutory definition of medical foods to “narrowly” constrain the types of products that fit within the category of food (see May 2007 Guidance, and Food Labeling; Reference Daily Intakes and Daily Reference Values; Mandatory Status of Nutrition Labeling and Nutrition Content Revision proposed rule.) This is a Final Rule and binding regulation on nutrition labeling for conventional foods.
 
The only FDA regulation pertaining to medical foods exempts them from the nutrition labeling requirements that apply to conventional foods, but they are subject to special labeling requirements, as noted in the following excerpt:
 
(j) The following foods are exempt from this section or are subject to special labeling requirements:
 
(8) Medical foods as defined in section 5(b) of the Orphan Drug Act. A medical food is a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally, or by mouth, under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation. A food is subject to this exemption only if: (i) It is a specially formulated and processed product (as opposed to a naturally occurring foodstuff used in its natural state) for the partial or exclusive feeding of a patient by means of oral intake or enteral feeding by tube; (ii) It is intended for the dietary management of a patient who, because of therapeutic or chronic medical needs, has limited or impaired capacity to ingest, digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs or certain nutrients, or who has other special medically determined nutrient requirements, the dietary management of which cannot be achieved by the modification of the normal diet alone; (iii) It provides nutritional support specifically modified for the management of the unique nutrient needs that result from the specific disease or condition, as determined by medical evaluation; (iv) It is intended to be used under medical supervision; and (v) It is intended only for a patient receiving active and ongoing medical supervision wherein the patient requires medical care on a recurring basis for, among other things, instructions on the use of the medical food.
 
Unlike regulation for drugs and for dietary supplements, there is no overall regulatory scheme for medical foods, or even a pending proposed rule, meaning that no FDA rulemaking is in progress. However, a very detailed Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“ANPR”) entitled “Regulation of Medical Foods,” was published in the Federal Register on Nov. 29, 1996 (“ANPR 1996”). This ANPR never progressed to a proposed rule, or through the Notice and Comment procedure, or to an eventual Final Rule (binding regulation). However, the ANPR, in conjunction with the May 2007 and August 2013 Draft Guidance still represents the FDA’s position and policy on medical foods. This ANPR was in effect withdrawn, because on April 22, 2003, the FDA published a proposal to withdraw numerous long-pending proposed rules, including this ANPR. The FDA cited as its reasons for withdrawal, first, that the subjects are not a regulatory priority, and agency resources are limited; second, the proposed rules have become outdated due to advances in science or changes in the products or the industry regulated, or changes in legal or regulatory contexts; and, third, to eliminate uncertainty, so that the FDA or the private sector may resolve underlying issues in ways other than those in the proposals. In May 2007, the FDA issued its Guidance to Industry relating to medical foods (“2007 Guidance”), presumably because the medical foods sector was growing, but it did not engage in a formal rulemaking procedure, either because it did not have the resources and/or because the medical foods category is still lower priority than drugs and medical devices. A third draft guidance was issued in August 2013 further attempting to clarify the FDA’s position on medical foods (“August 2013 Draft Guidance”). Although the guidance has not been formalized, the Company maintains compliance with this draft guidance.

Medical Food Regulatory Requirements
 
Overview:  Medical foods are FDA-regulated, but there is no complete set or scheme of regulations. There is no pre-market approval, or even pre-market notification required. Rather, it is the responsibility of the manufacturer and marketer to test for safety and efficacy before marketing and selling. The developer of a medical food must adhere closely to the statutory definition, and to the descriptions of a medical food in the sole FDA regulation regarding exemption from nutrition labeling, and in the 2007 Guidance and the August 2013 Draft Guidance.
Threshold Issue: The manufacturer must demonstrate that the disease or condition to be targeted, scientifically and medically, is a disease with distinctive or unique nutritional requirements. The FDA has stated that this is a “narrow category,” and that whether a product is valid for this category depends on the published medical science of the disease and its origins. The targeted disease or condition may be, or caused by, a metabolic imbalance or deficiency or the accelerated requirements for a certain nutrient caused by a disease state. The Company and its Scientific Advisory Board examine the distinctive nutritional requirements of a disease.
Formulation: A medical food may not be a single ingredient formula. Otherwise, that product would be a dietary supplement for a nutrient deficiency. A medical food formula must go beyond a mere modification of the diet. The formula must meet and satisfy the distinctive nutritional requirements, not merely ameliorate the symptoms. For example, Glucosamine or MSM, or an herb’s “active” constituent may indeed help osteoarthritis. One must demonstrate that these nutrients are the distinctive nutritional requirements for osteoarthritis.
Safety: There is no particular or mandated FDA pre-market safety studies required of the formula as a whole. However, all ingredients must be either GRAS or approved food-additives. Since medical foods are typically taken with prescription drugs, the developer must assess whether any medical food/drug interactions pose a risk. Many ingredients have been determined by the FDA to be GRAS and are listed as such by regulation. Other ingredients may achieve self-affirmed GRAS status through a panel of experts on that particular substance that author a GRAS Report. The standard for an ingredient to achieve GRAS status requires not only technical demonstration of non-toxicity and safety, but also general recognition and agreement on that safety by experts in the field. All ingredients used in the Company’s medical foods are either FDA-approved food additives or have GRAS status. The GRAS requirement for ingredients is arguably a higher safety standard than the risk/benefit analysis required for pharmaceuticals. Like any evolving area, especially where no premarket approval is required, the FDA reserves the right to raise questions about the qualification of products within any category as well as the labeling and manufacturing safety of those products.
Efficacy: No particular FDA pre-market efficacy studies are required by the FDA or by statute, similar to or comparable to Phase 2 & 3 trials for prescription drugs. However, a company must have data to demonstrate that the formula, when taken as directed, meets the distinctive nutritional requirements of the particular disease.
Manufacturing: There are no GMP regulations for medical foods in particular. Drug GMPs are not required, nor are the relatively new dietary supplement GMPs required; only food GMPs are required. The manufacture of the Company’s medical foods is outsourced in its entirety. The Company engages state of the art facilities that manufacture only nutritional supplements and medical foods.
Labeling: As for all food labels, printing must be legible, and many required elements must be conspicuous, such as a statement of identity, which is the name of the food; the statement: “Must be administered under the supervision of a physician or professional healthcare provider;” the quantity; the ingredients listing; the name and address of the distributor among other requirements.
Marketing: A medical food is a food product, thus the FDA does not regulate advertisements and promotional activities according to the pharmaceutical statutes and regulations; there is no side effects disclaimer or fair balancing required, as in direct to consumer (“DTC”) advertising of drugs on television. However, the FDA has a very broad definition of “labeling”; thus all promotional materials, including websites, are under the authority, monitoring and enforcement of FDA. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) also has joint jurisdiction with the FDA over food products, per a 1983 Memorandum of Understanding. Thus, all advertising claims, both express and implied, must be true, accurate, well-substantiated, and not misleading.
Enforcement: Enforcement is post-market, mostly via annual FDA inspections of food facilities, including packaging, distribution facilities, and fulfillment houses, as well as the manufacturer. The FDA also gathers material at trade shows and conferences and examines websites. The FTC has joint jurisdiction, and performs sophisticated Internet searches, both randomly and at the request of the FDA or of a competitor.

Medical Device Regulatory Requirements
 
To fall within the purview of the FDA, a product must first meet the definition of a medical device, whereby it is then subject to regulation before and after it is marketed. Section 201(h) of the FDCA defines a device as “an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component, part, or accessory, which is ... intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals.” If the product in question is not a medical device, then no regulation applies. If it is a medical device, then one must evaluate applicable regulation.
 
Since 1976, the FDA’s paradigm has categorized medical devices in three distinct classes based on the potential health risks to the public – Class I, Class II, and Class III. Medical devices are assigned a classification based on the level of control needed in order to provide the FDA reasonable assurance of the product’s safety and effectiveness. If a device represents a very low risk of injury, it is considered Class I and does not require any premarket approval. While most Class I devices are exempt from premarket notification requirements and regulations for good manufacturing practices, there are some general controls that companies must conduct such as registering the company with the FDA, listing the device, paying an annual registration fee and tracking device activity.
 
Devices that present an intermediate level of risk of injury to people are considered Class II. The FDA’s perspective is that for Class II devices “general controls alone are insufficient to assure safety and effectiveness.” In addition to general controls, Class II devices also require special controls such as specified content on labels, adherence to performance standards and surveillance of the product in the marketplace. Some medical devices are also subject to a “Premarket Notification” under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Most Class I and some Class II devices are exempt from the 510(k) Premarket Notification requirement. If a Class II device is subject to the 510(k) requirement, the manufacturer must file a premarket notification with the FDA to demonstrate that the device is “substantially similar” to another Class II device already on the market. Establishing substantial similarity provides the FDA reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective.
 
High risk devices are Class III. These are devices that either sustain human life or present an unreasonable risk of injury to humans. Because of the risks involved, the FDA does not believe that general or special controls are sufficient to assure safety and effectiveness. The FDA requires general controls and premarket approval (“PMA”) for Class III devices.
 
VectorVision is registered with the FDA and the CSV-1000 and the ESV-3000 medical devices are listed with the FDA as Class I medical devices. As Class I medical devices, the CSV-1000 and the ESV-3000 are safe medical devices each with a very low potential risk of injury to a patient. These devices do not require any premarket approval.
 
With the assistance of regulatory affairs consultants, the Company has determined the relevant predicate device for the MapcatSF is the MPS II, the applicable product code for the MapcatSF is HJW and the applicable Code of Federal Regulation is 886.1050. The FDA has determined that this particular predicate device, and related product code, is a Class I medical device. Based on this, the Company believes the MapcatSF is correctly classified as a Class I medical device, is a safe medical device with a very low potential risk of injury to a patient and does not require any premarket approval.
 
Stark Law
 
Congress enacted significant prohibitions against physician self-referrals in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. This law and its supporting regulations, which have been amended and expanded substantially, are commonly referred to as the “Stark Law,” and prohibit a physician from making any referral of a Stark Designated Health Service (“DHS”) to an entity with which the physician has any kind of financial relationship, unless all of the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception are met. Stark covered DHS include both outpatient prescription drugs and diagnostic testing that are reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid. Many states have similar laws, some of which can apply to all payors and not just governmental payors. While the Company believes that its arrangements with its customers are in compliance with the federal and any state Stark Laws, the Stark Laws present different levels of risks as to the Company’s two lines of business: (1) sale of the Company’s medical food, Lumega-Z, and medical device, the MapcatSF; and (2) the Company’s performance of TCD testing.
 
1. Medical Food, Lumega-Z, and Medical Device, the MapcatSF. These products are neither prescription drugs nor are they reimbursable under any federal program at present. The federal Stark Law is thus inapplicable. Further, the Company’s believes that these products are also not covered under any potentially applicable state Stark Laws. The federal Stark Law, however, includes an exception for the provision of in-office ancillary services, including a physician’s dispensing of outpatient prescription drugs, provided that the physician meets specified requirements. To the extent that the products might become reimbursable under a federal program, or otherwise become covered under the Stark Law, the Company believes that the physicians who use the Company’s medical device, the MapcatSF, or recommend its medical food, Lumega-Z, to their patients are aware of these requirements. However, the Company does not monitor their compliance and has no assurance that the physicians are in material compliance with Stark II. If it were determined that the physicians who use the Company’s medical device or prescribe medical foods purchased from the Company were not in compliance with Stark II, it could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

2. The TCD Testing Business. The TCD tests performed by the Company can be reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid and otherwise constitute a Stark covered DHS, which include diagnostic testing. Moreover, in conducting TCD tests, the Company will be using space provided by the ordering physician. As a result, the Stark Law fully applies to the TCD Testing Business, as the ordering physician has a financial relationship with the Company, through the Company’s use of the physician’s space (for which fair market value rent must be charged), and the physician is referring a DHS – the TCD tests – to the Company. In addition, the Company will be enrolling the ordering physicians in clinical research trials and compensating the physicians for their participation in the trials, thereby creating an additional Stark cognizable financial relationship between the parties.
 
 Anti-Kickback Statute and HIPAA Criminal Laws
 
The federal anti-kickback statute (the “AKS”) applies to Medicare, Medicaid and other state and federal programs. AKS prohibits the solicitation, offer, payment or receipt of remuneration in return for referrals or the purchase, or in return for recommending or arranging for the referral or purchase, of goods, including drugs, covered by the federal health care programs. At present, the Company does not participate in any federal programs and its products are not reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or any other state or federal program. The AKS is a criminal statute with criminal penalties, as well as potential civil and administrative penalties. The AKS, however, provides a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory “safe harbors” for particular types of transactions. Many states have similar fraud and abuse laws and their own anti-kickback laws, some of which can apply to all payors, and not just governmental payors. While the Company believes that it is in material compliance with both federal and state AKS laws, the AKS laws present different levels of risks as to the Company’s two lines of business: (1) sale of the Company’s medical food, Lumega-Z, and medical device, the MapcatSF; and (2) the Company’s performance of TCD testing.
 
1. Medical Food, Lumega-Z, and Medical Device, the MapcatSF. At present, the Company’s products are not reimbursable under any federal program. If, however, that changes in the future and it were determined that the Company was not in compliance with the AKS, the Company could be subject to liability, and its operations could be curtailed. Moreover, if the activities of its customers or other entity with which the Company has a business relationship were found to constitute a violation of the AKS and the Company, as a result of the provision of products or services to such customer or entity, were found to have knowingly participated in such activities, the Company could be subject to sanctions or liability under such laws, including civil and/or criminal penalties, as well as exclusion from government health programs. As a result of exclusion from government health programs, neither products nor services could be provided to any beneficiaries of any federal healthcare program.
 
2. The TCD Testing Business. The TCD tests performed by the Company can be reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid. As a result, the federal AKS (and potentially any state anti-kickback law) will be implicated to the extent the financial relationships between the physician customers and the Company are not set at a fair market value amount unrelated to the volume or value of TCD tests being ordered. If the Company’s arrangements with ordering physicians were found to constitute a violation of the federal AKS, or any applicable state anti-kickback law, we could be subject to sanctions or liability under such laws, including civil and/or criminal penalties, as well as exclusion from government health programs. As a result of exclusion from government health programs, neither products nor services could be provided to any beneficiaries of any federal healthcare program.
 
HIPAA Compliance and Privacy Protection
 
HIPAA established comprehensive federal protection for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations, or “Covered Entities”: (1) health plans, (2) health care clearing houses, and (3) health care providers who conduct certain health care transactions electronically. Covered Entities must have in place administrative, physical and technical standards to guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information. Additionally, some state laws impose privacy protections more stringent than HIPAA’s. There are also international privacy laws, such as the European Data Directive, that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact the Company’s business in the future.
 
HITECH Act
 
The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act promotes the adoption and meaningful use of health information technology. The HITECH Act addresses the privacy and security concerns associated with the electronic transmission of health information, in part, through several provisions that strengthen the civil and criminal enforcement of the HIPAA rules.
 
Physician Sunshine Act
 
Health Care Reform Law provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program, has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity. The Centers for Medicine and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities.

15
--

 

Under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act applicable organizations are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships they have with physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act preempts similar state reporting laws, although some companies may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal law, are ambiguous. Because the Company’s medical devices are Class I, not subject to premarket approval, and not reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program the Company believes it is not currently subject to the Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements. As the Company pursues commercialization of the MapcatSF® and considers introducing new products, these requirements will be reevaluated to determine their applicability to the Company’s activities.
 
The Federal False Claims Act
 
The Federal False Claims Act provides for the imposition of extensive financial penalties (including treble damages and fines of over $22,000 for every false claim) if a provider submits false claims to any governmental health program either knowingly or in reckless disregard or in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the claims at issue. Liability under the False Claims Act can arise from patterns of deficient documentation, coding and billing, as well as for billing for services that are deemed not to have been medically necessary for the treatment of the patient. Many states have their own False Claims Acts as well. The Company will be billing governmental health care programs for the TCD testing, and the False Claims Act is thus potentially applicable to the Company’s operations. The Company is putting in place a fraud and abuse compliance program that is designed to ensure that the Company’s documentation, coding and billing for TCD tests are accurate and compliant. Any patterns of uncorrected deficiencies in documenting, coding and billing for TCD tests, however, may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.
State Regulatory Requirements
 
Each state has its own regulations concerning physician dispensing, restrictions on the Corporate Practice of Medicine (“CPOM”), anti-kickback and false claim regulations. In addition, each state has a board of pharmacy that regulates the sale and distribution of drugs and other therapeutic agents. Some states require that a physician obtain a license to dispense prescription products. When considering the commencement of business in a new state, the Company consults with healthcare counsel regarding the expansion of operations and utilizes local counsel when necessary.
 
Many states prohibit or otherwise regulate under CPOM rules the extent to which non-licensed personnel may be involved in the practice of medicine or otherwise employ licensed personnel. Related state rules further limit the extent to which fees for professional services may be shared or “split” between parties. Under the TCD Testing line of business, such rules in some states my impact the Company’s relationship with the radiologists who will be reading and interpreting the results of the TCD tests, and thereby providing the “professional component” of such tests. The Company is structuring its financial and billing relationships with such radiologists to be in compliance with applicable state rules. Failure to comply with state CPOM and fee splitting rules, however, may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.
 
Other United States Regulatory Requirements
 
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drug and biological products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection, unfair competition, and other laws. In addition, the Company may be subject to federal and state laws requiring the disclosure of financial arrangements with health care professionals.
Foreign Regulatory Requirements
 
The Company may eventually be subject to widely varying foreign regulations, which may be quite different from those of the FDA, governing clinical trials, manufacturing, product registration and approval, and sales. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, generally the Company must obtain a separate approval for a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries prior to the commencement of product marketing in those countries. In certain countries, regulatory authorities also establish pricing and reimbursement criteria. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
