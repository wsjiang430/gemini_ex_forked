ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 As used herein, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, all references to “Orion,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “Company” and similar references are to Orion Energy Systems, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 Overview
 We provide state-of-the-art LED lighting, wireless Internet of Things (“IoT”) enabled control solutions, and energy project management.  We research, design, develop, manufacture, market, sell, install, and implement energy management systems consisting primarily of high-performance, energy-efficient commercial and industrial interior and exterior lighting systems and related services. Our products are targeted for applications in three primary market segments: commercial office and retail, area lighting, and industrial applications, although we do sell and install products into other markets. Virtually all of our sales occur within North America.
 Our lighting products consist primarily of light emitting diode ("LED") lighting fixtures, many of which include IoT enabled control systems. Our principal customers include large national account end-users, electrical distributors and energy service companies ("ESCOs").  Currently, substantially all of our products are manufactured at our leased production facility located in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, although as the LED market continues to evolve, we are increasingly sourcing products and components from third parties in order to provide versatility in our product development.
 We have experienced recent success offering our comprehensive project management services to national account customers to retrofit their multiple locations. Our comprehensive services include initial site surveys and audits, utility incentive and government subsidy management, engineering design, and project management from delivery through to installation and controls integration.
 We believe the market for LED lighting products continues to grow. Due to their size and flexibility in application, we also believe that LED lighting systems can address opportunities for retrofit applications that cannot be satisfied by other lighting technologies. Our LED lighting technologies have become the primary component of our revenue as we continue to strive to be a leader in the LED market.  
 We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers that provide us with recurring revenue from period to period and we typically generate substantially all of our revenue from sales of lighting systems and related services to governmental, commercial and industrial customers on a project-by-project basis. We also perform work under global services or product purchasing agreements with major customers with sales completed on a purchase order basis.  We typically sell our lighting systems in replacement of our customers’ existing fixtures. We call this replacement process a "retrofit".  We frequently engage our customer’s existing electrical contractor to provide installation and project management services. We also sell our lighting systems on a wholesale basis, principally to electrical distributors and ESCOs to sell to their own customer bases.
 The gross margins of our products can vary significantly depending upon the types of products we sell, with margins typically ranging from 10% to 50%. As a result, a change in the total mix of our sales among higher or lower margin products can cause our profitability to fluctuate from period to period.
 Reportable Segments
 Reportable segments are components of an entity that have separate financial data that the entity's chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews when allocating resources and assessing performance. Our CODM is our chief executive officer. We have three reportable segments:  Orion Engineered Systems Division ("OES"), and Orion Distribution Services Division ("ODS"), and Orion U.S. Markets Division ("USM").
 For financial results by reportable segment, please refer to Note 16, "Segment Data" in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. of this Annual Report.

 Orion U.S. Markets Division
 The USM segment sells commercial lighting systems and energy management systems to the wholesale contractor markets. USM customers are primarily ESCOs.
 Our Market Opportunity
 We provide enterprise-grade LED lighting and energy project solutions.  We are primarily focused on providing commercial and industrial facilities lighting retrofit solutions in North America using solid-state LED technology. We believe the market for lighting products has shifted to LED lighting systems and continues to grow.  We believe that LED lighting technology allows for better optical performance, significantly reduced maintenance costs due to performance longevity and reduced energy consumption. Due to their size and flexibility in application, we also believe that LED lighting systems can address opportunities for retrofit applications that cannot be satisfied by other technologies. 
 Our products deliver energy savings and efficiency gains to our commercial and industrial customers without compromising their quantity or quality of light. We estimate that our energy management systems reduce our customers’ legacy lighting-related electricity costs by approximately 50% or greater, while maintaining their quantity of light after the reduced wattage and improving overall lighting quality when replacing traditional fixtures. Our customers with legacy lighting systems typically realize a one to four-year payback period, and most often 12 – 18 months, from electricity cost savings generated by our lighting systems without considering utility incentives or government subsidies.  
 Energy-efficient lighting systems are cost-effective and environmentally responsible solutions allowing end users to reduce operating expenses. Based on a July 2015 report published by the United States Department of Energy, or DOE, we estimate the potential North American LED retrofit market within our primary markets to be approximately 1.1 billion lighting fixtures.  We serve government and private sector end-customers in the following primary markets: commercial office and retail, area lighting and industrial applications.
 Commercial office and retail. Our commercial office and retail market includes commercial office buildings, retail store fronts, government offices, schools, hospitals and other buildings with traditional 10 to 12 foot ceiling heights. The DOE estimates that there are approximately 987 million office "troffer" fixtures within the United States, which is a rectangular light fixture that fits into a modular dropped ceiling grid. We believe we have the opportunity to increase our revenue by serving this market with our LED Door Retrofit, or LDRTM, lighting solutions.
 Area lighting. Our market for area lighting includes parking garages, surface lots, automobile dealerships and gas service stations. The DOE estimates that there are approximately 66 million area lighting fixtures within the United States and an additional 45 million roadway lighting fixtures in the United States.
 Industrial applications. Our market for industrial facilities includes manufacturing facilities, distribution and warehouse facilities, government buildings and agricultural buildings. These facilities typically contain "high-bay" lighting fixtures. The DOE estimates that there are approximately 139 million low/high bay fixtures within the United States. 
 7


Commercial and industrial facilities in the United States employ a variety of lighting technologies, including HID, traditional fluorescents, LED and incandescent lighting fixtures. We estimate that approximately 50% of this market still utilizes inefficient high intensity discharge ("HID") lighting technologies. Our lighting systems typically replace less efficient HID, HIF fixtures, and earlier generation of LED fixtures. According to the Electric Power Research Institute, or EPRI, HID fixtures only convert approximately 36% of the energy they consume into visible light. We estimate that our energy management systems reduce our customers’ legacy lighting-related electricity costs by approximately 50% or greater, while improving overall lighting quality when replacing traditional fixtures. 
 We believe that utilities within the United States recognize the importance of energy efficiency as an economical means to manage capacity constraints and as a low-cost alternative when compared to the construction costs of building new power plants. Accordingly, many of these utilities are continually focused on demand reduction through energy efficiency. According to our research of individual state and utility programs, 50 states, through legislation, regulation or voluntary action, have seen their utilities design and fund programs that promote or deliver energy efficiency.  Our products are not solely dependent upon these incentive programs, but we do believe that these incentive programs provide an important benefit as our customers evaluate their out-of-pocket cash investments.
 Our Solution
 Value Proposition. We estimate our LED lighting systems generally reduce lighting-related electricity costs by approximately 50% or greater, compared to legacy fixtures, while improving overall lighting quality.
 Multi-Facility Roll-Out Capability. We offer our customers a single source, turnkey solution for project implementation in which we manage and maintain responsibility for entire multi-facility roll-outs of our energy management solutions across North American commercial and industrial facility portfolios. This capability allows us to offer our customers an orderly, timely and scheduled process for recognizing energy reductions and cost savings.
 Rapid Payback Period. In most retrofit projects where we replace HID and HIF fixtures, our customers typically realize a one to four year, but most often 12 – 18 months, payback period on our lighting systems. These returns are achieved without considering utility incentives or government subsidies (although subsidies and incentives are continually being made available to our customers in connection with the installation of our systems that further shorten payback periods).
 Easy Installation, Implementation and Maintenance. Most of our fixtures are designed with a lightweight construction and modular plug-and-play architecture that allows for fast and easy installation, facilitates maintenance, and integration of other components of our energy management system. Our office LED Troffer Door Retrofit ("LDRTM") products are designed to allow for a fast and easy installation without disrupting the ceiling space or the office workspace. We believe our system’s design reduces installation time and expense compared to other lighting solutions, which further improves our customers’ return on investment. We also believe that our use of standard components reduces our customers’ ongoing maintenance costs.
 Expanded Product Offerings. We are committed to continue developing LED product offerings in all of the markets we serve.  Our third generation of  ISON® class of LED interior fixture delivers a market leading 214 lumens per watt.  This advancement means our customers can get more light with less energy, and sometimes fewer fixtures, than with any other product on the market.  In fiscal 2018 and 2019, we launched a variety of new products, features and functionality targeting healthcare, food service, high and low temperature environments and other market segments.  See "Products and Services" below.
 Environmental Benefits. By allowing for the permanent reduction of electricity consumption, our energy management systems reduce indirect CO2 emissions that are a negative by-product of energy generation. We estimate that one of our LED lighting systems, when replacing a standard HID fixture, displaces 0.352 kW of electricity, which, based on information provided by the EPA, reduces a customer’s indirect CO2 emissions by approximately 1.5 tons per year.

Our Competitive Strengths
 Compelling Value Proposition. By permanently reducing lighting-related electricity usage, our systems enable our customers to achieve significant cost savings, without compromising quantity and quality of light in their facilities. As a result, our products offer our customers a rapid return on their investment, without relying on government subsidies or utility incentives. 
 Comprehensive Project Management. We offer our customers a single source solution whereby we manage and are responsible for an entire retrofit lighting project, from initial site surveys and energy audits through to installation and controls integration. Our ability to offer such comprehensive turnkey project management services, coupled with best-in-class customer service, allows us to deliver energy reductions and cost savings to our customers in timely, orderly and planned multi-facility roll-outs nationwide. We experienced substantial success with offering these services in fiscal 2019 with one national account customer entering into commitments to retrofit multiple locations beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and continuing throughout our fiscal 2020.
 Large and Growing Customer Base. We have developed a large and growing national customer base, and have installed our products in more than 14,500 commercial and industrial facilities across North America. We believe that the willingness of our blue-chip customers to install our products across multiple facilities represents a significant endorsement of our value proposition, which in turn helps us sell our energy management systems to new customers. We intend to leverage our expertise in managing projects across multiple facilities within our new LED product markets, which now include new customer opportunities with banks, insurance companies, hospitals, fast food chains, retail storefronts, grocery and pharmacies. 
 Innovative Technology. We have developed a portfolio of 104 United States patents primarily covering various elements of our products. We believe these innovations allow our products to produce more light output per unit of input energy compared to our competition. We also have 15 patents pending that primarily cover various elements of our newly developed LED products and certain business methods. To complement our innovative energy management products, our integrated energy management services provide our customers with a turnkey solution either at a single facility or across their North American facility footprints. Our demonstrated ability to innovate provides us with significant competitive advantages. Our lighting products offer significantly more light output as measured in foot-candles of light delivered per watt of electricity consumed when compared to HID or traditional fluorescent fixtures.  Beyond the benefits of our lighting fixtures, we believe that there is also an opportunity to utilize our system platform as a “connected ceiling” or “smart ceiling”, or a framework or network that can support the installation and integration of other solutions on a digital platform. This “smart ceiling” can be integrated with other technologies to collect data and manage assets and resources more efficiently. This anticipated potential growth opportunity is also known as the “Industrial Internet of Things” or IoT and is in the early adoption phase in the marketplace as businesses and municipalities explore use of these new technologies to optimize operations or develop “smart cities”.  Orion’s percentage of systems utilizing IoT enabled devices has grown significantly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue. Our IoT enabled devices not only contain energy management control functions, but also have the ability to collect facility usage and traffic data as well as collect data from other facility mechanical systems.
 Expanded Sales and Distribution Network. In addition to selling directly to national accounts and ESCOs, we sell our lighting products and services to electrical distributors through a North American network of independent lighting agencies.  As of the end of fiscal 2019, we had approximately 50 different independent lighting agencies representing us in substantially all of North America.  We intend to continue to selectively build our sales network in the future, with a focus on geographic regions where we do not currently have a strong sales presence.
Our Growth Strategies
 Our ability to achieve our desired revenue growth and profitability goals depends on our ability to effectively execute on the following key strategic initiatives: 
 Focus on executing and marketing our turnkey LED retrofit capabilities to large national account customers. We believe one of our competitive advantages is our ability to deliver full turnkey LED lighting project capabilities starting with energy audits and site assessments that lead to custom engineering and manufacturing through to fully managed installations. These attributes coupled with our superior customer service, high quality designs and expedited delivery responsiveness resulted in our contract to retrofit multiple locations for a single national account. This contract will lead our growth momentum for fiscal 2020 and beyond.

Support success of our ESCO and agent-driven distribution sales channels. We continue to focus on building our relationships and product and sales support for our ESCO and agent driven distribution channels. These efforts include an array of product and sales training efforts as well as the development of new products to cater to the unique needs of these sales channels. 
 Continued Product Innovation. We continue to innovate, developing lighting fixtures and features that address specific customer requirements, while also working to maintain a leadership position in energy efficiency, smart product design and installation benefits. We also continue to deepen our capabilities in the integration of smart lighting controls. Our goal is to provide state-of-the-art lighting products with modular plug-and-play designs to enable lighting system customization from basic controls to advanced IoT capabilities. 
 Leveraging of Orion’s Smart Lighting Systems to Support Internet of Things Applications. We believe we are ideally positioned to help customers to efficiently deploy new IoT controls and applications by leveraging the “Smart Ceiling” capabilities of their Orion solid state lighting system. IoT capabilities can include the management and tracking of facilities, personnel, resources and customer behavior, driving both sales and lowering costs. As a result, these added capabilities provide customers an even greater return on investment from their lighting system and make us an even more attractive partner.
Products and Services
 Our primary focus has been, and will continue to be, emphasizing our LED lighting fixtures. Currently, substantially all of our products are manufactured at our leased production facility location in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, although as the LED market continues to evolve, we also source products and components from third parties in order to have versatility in our product development.  We are focused on researching, developing and/or acquiring new innovative LED products and technologies for the retrofit markets, such as the LDRTM.  We plan to focus our efforts on developing creative new LED retrofit products in order to offer our customers a variety of integrated energy management services, such as system design, project management and installation.
Products
 The following is a description of our primary products:
 The LED Troffer Door Retrofit (LDRTM): The LDRTM is designed to replace existing 4 foot by 2 foot and 2 foot by 2 foot fluorescent troffers that are frequently found in office or retail grid ceilings. Our LDRTM product is unique in that the LED optics and electronics are housed within the doorframe that allows for installation of the product in approximately one to two minutes. Our LDRTM product also provides reduced maintenance expenses based upon improved LED chips.
 Interior LED High Bay Fixtures: Our LED interior high bay lighting products consist of our Harris high bay, ApolloTM high bay and ISON® high bay products. Our ISON® class of LED interior fixture offers a full package of premium features, including low total cost of ownership, optics that currently exceed competitors in terms of lumen package, delivered light, modularity and advanced thermal management. Our third generation of ISON® class of LED interior fixture delivers up to an exceptional 214 lumens per watt.  This advancement means our customers can get more light with less energy, and sometimes fewer fixtures, compared to other products on the market.  Our ApolloTM class of LED interior fixtures is designed for new construction and retrofit projects where initial cost is the largest factor in the purchase decision. Our Harris high bay is ideal for customers seeking a cost-effective solution to deliver energy savings and maintenance reductions.  In addition, our LED interior lighting products are lightweight and easy to handle, which further reduces installation and maintenance costs and helps to build brand loyalty with electrical contractors and installers.
 Smart Lighting Controls. We offer a broad array of smart building control systems that have either been developed by us under the InteLiteTM brand or procured from third parties. These control systems provide both lighting control options (such as occupancy, daylight, or schedule control) and data intelligence capabilities for building managers to log, monitor, and analyze use of space, energy savings, and provide physical security of the space.
 Other Products. We also offer our customers a variety of other LED and HIF fixtures to address their lighting and energy management needs, including fixtures designed for agribusinesses, parking lots, roadways, retail, mezzanine, outdoor applications and private label resale.

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also provide other services that comprise a small amount of our revenue. These services primarily include management and control of power quality and remote monitoring and control of our installed systems. We also sell and distribute replacement lamps and fixture components into the after-market.
 Our Customers
 We primarily target commercial, institutional and industrial customers who have warehousing, retail, manufacturing, and office facilities.  In fiscal 2019, one customer accounted for 20.7% of total revenue.  We expect this customer will continue to account for even a substantially higher percentage of our fiscal 2020 total revenue.  In fiscal 2018, two customers accounted for 11.7% and 10.8% of total revenue.  In fiscal 2017, there was no single customer that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. While we continue to seek to diversify our customer base by expanding our reach to national accounts, ESCOs and the agent driven distribution channel, we expect to continue to derive a significant percentage of our revenue from contracts with one customer.  These contracts are entered into in the ordinary course of business and provide that we will deliver products and services on a work order or purchase order basis and any purchase order may be terminated prior to shipment. The contracts do not guarantee that the customer will buy our products or services.  
 The amount and concentration of our revenues with one or more customer may fluctuate on a year to year basis depending on the number of purchase orders issued by our customers.  The loss of a significant customer or the termination of a material volume of purchase orders (or the underlying agreements) could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
 11


Sales and Marketing
 We sell our products in one of three ways: (i) directly with our relationships with our national account partners; (ii) indirectly through independent sales agencies and broadline North American distributors; and (iii) through ESCOs. Our ODS segment focuses on developing and expanding customer relationships with independent manufacturer’s agents and broadline distributors. During fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, we engaged approximately 50 manufacturer representative agencies to expand our reach with broadline distributors and further enhance our ability to increase our revenue. We attempt to leverage the customer relationships of these distributors to further extend the geographic scope of our selling efforts. We work cooperatively with our indirect channels through participation in national trade organizations and by providing training on our sales methodologies.
 We have historically focused our marketing efforts on traditional direct advertising, as well as developing brand awareness through customer education and active participation in trade shows and energy management seminars. These efforts have included participating in national, regional and local trade organizations, exhibiting at trade shows, executing targeted direct mail campaigns, advertising in select publications, public relations campaigns, social media and other lead generation and brand-building initiatives.
 Competition
 The market for energy-efficient lighting products and services is fragmented. We face strong competition primarily from manufacturers and distributors of lighting products and services as well as electrical contractors. We compete primarily on the basis of technology, cost, performance, quality, customer experience, energy efficiency, customer service and marketing support.
 There are a number of lighting fixture manufacturers that sell LED and HIF products that compete with our lighting product lines. Lighting companies such as Acuity Brands, Inc., Carmanah Technology Corporation, Energy Focus, Inc., Eaton Corporation plc, Cree, Inc., LSI Industries, Inc., Revolution Lighting Technologies Inc., TCP International Holdings, Inc., and Hubbell Incorporated are some of our main competitors within the commercial office, retail and industrial markets.  We are also facing increased competition from manufacturers in low-cost countries.
 We also face competition from companies who provide energy management services. Some of these competitors, such as Ameresco, Inc., Johnson Controls, Inc. and Honeywell International, provide basic systems and controls designed to further energy efficiency.
 Intellectual Property
 As of March 31, 2019, we had been issued 104 United States patents and have applied for 15 additional United States patents. The patented and patent pending technologies cover various innovative elements of our products, including our HIF and LED fixtures. Our patented LDRTM product allows for a significantly quicker installation when compared to competitor's commercial office lighting products. Our smart lighting controls allow our lighting fixtures to selectively provide a targeted amount of light where and when it is needed most.
 We believe that our patent portfolio as a whole is material to our business. We also believe that our patents covering our ability to manage the thermal and optical performance of our LED and HIF lighting products are material to our business, and that the loss of these patents could significantly and adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.
 Backlog
 Backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to realize in the future as a result of firm, committed orders. Our backlog as of March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018 totaled $10.8 million and $3.3 million, respectively.  We generally expect our backlog to be recognized as revenue within one year. 
Manufacturing and Distribution
 We lease an approximately 197,000 square foot manufacturing and distribution facility located in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, where substantially all of our products are manufactured.
 12


We generally maintain a significant supply of raw material and purchased and manufactured component inventory. We contract with transportation companies to ship our products and manage all aspects of distribution logistics. We generally ship our products directly to the end user.
Research and Development
 Our research and development efforts are centered on developing new LED products and technologies and enhancing existing products. The products, technologies and services we are developing are focused on increasing end user energy efficiency and enhancing lighting output.  Over the last three fiscal years, we have focused our development on additional LED products, resulting in our development and commercialization of several new suites of LED interior high bay products.
 We operate research and development lab and test facilities in our Jacksonville, Florida and Manitowoc, Wisconsin locations.
 Regulatory Matters
 Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to water, the remediation of contaminated properties and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of, and exposure to, waste and other materials, as well as laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. We believe that our business, operations, and facilities are being operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations.
 State, county or municipal statutes often require that a licensed electrician be present and supervise each retrofit project. Further, all installations of electrical fixtures are subject to compliance with electrical codes in virtually all jurisdictions in the United States. In cases where we engage independent contractors to perform our retrofit projects, we believe that compliance with these laws and regulations is the responsibility of the applicable contractor.
