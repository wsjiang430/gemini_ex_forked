Item 1. Business
Overview
nCino is the pioneer in cloud banking. Built by bankers for bankers, the nCino Bank Operating System is a single, multi-tenant software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution that helps financial institutions ("FI") modernize, innovate and outperform. A leader in the global financial services technology industry, nCino is a proven partner that has helped more than 1,850 FIs of all sizes and complexities, including global, enterprise, regional and community banks; credit unions; new market entrants; and independent mortgage banks power distinctive experiences, drive growth efficiencies, and run with full integrity. With nCino, FIs can:
•Digitally Serve Their Clients Across All Lines of Business. The nCino Bank Operating System delivers distinctive experiences across devices, channels and products, enabling a seamless digital relationship between a FI, its employees, its clients and key third parties. Because nCino is a cloud native platform, employees can serve their customers anywhere, at any time, from any internet-enabled device, empowering them to build deeper relationships. For consumers who increasingly expect frictionless digital services from their FI, this ability is no longer a differentiator, but a necessity. 
•Improve Financial Results. Our customers leverage nCino’s capabilities to drive revenue growth by delivering new products, eliminating redundant legacy systems, improving client satisfaction and retention and digitally expanding their brand presence and reach. By connecting previously disjointed functions and breaking down internal silos, nCino increases transparency at all organizational levels across lines of business, enabling FIs to measure their operations and maximize performance, productivity and profitability. 
•Elevate Employee Experience and Performance. The nCino Bank Operating System’s automation, workflow and digitization capabilities help eliminate manual processes and redundant efforts, freeing FIs' employees to focus on their clients’ experiences rather than their transactions. In addition, our intelligent enterprise content management system includes a standardized filing system across applications, providing instant and ongoing access to digital documentation and checklists to help enable customers to meet their compliance and credit requirements. For example, client documents are associated with a unique identifier, eliminating the need for repeat document collection and duplicative data input, which means employees only have to ask for information once.
•Manage Risk and Compliance More Effectively. The nCino Bank Operating System helps FIs reduce regulatory, credit and operational risk through automated workflow, data reporting, standardized risk rating calculations and financial modeling. For example, the content management, automated workflow and digital audit trail and snapshot functionality within the nCino Bank Operating System helps our customers more effectively and efficiently prepare for regulatory examinations. Because the software is highly configurable, it can be adjusted as the FI's risk requirements and the regulatory environment evolve, helping FIs adapt to regulatory changes.
•Establish an Active Data, Audit and Business Intelligence Hub. Key to the nCino Bank Operating System is its “single source of truth” data model. In an industry where every moment matters, this centralized hub enables data to be more easily accessed, modeled and analyzed to help deliver greater operational, portfolio and financial intelligence, a more complete client view and improved compliance monitoring and metrics, as well as the opportunity to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning ("AI/ML") more successfully. In addition, with an open application programming interface ("API") technology framework and integrations with third-party data sources, FIs can use nCino to augment their client and operational data and create a paperless, centralized hub that enhances data-driven decision-making.
Our Journey 
nCino was originally founded in a bank to improve that FI’s operations and client service. After realizing that virtually all FIs were dealing with the same problems—cumbersome legacy technology, fragmented data, and disconnected business functions—we were spun out as a separate company in late 2011. This heritage is the foundation of our deep banking domain expertise, which differentiates us, continues to drive our strategy and makes us uniquely qualified to help FIs cross the 
modernization divide by providing a comprehensive solution that onboards clients, originates loans, and opens accounts on a single, cloud-based platform.
We initially focused the nCino Bank Operating System on transforming commercial and small business lending for community and regional banks in the United States ("U.S."). We introduced this solution to enterprise banks in the U.S. in 2014, and then internationally in 2017, and have subsequently expanded across North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific ("APAC"). Throughout this market expansion, we broadened the nCino Bank Operating System by adding functionality for consumer lending, client onboarding, deposit account opening, analytics and AI/ML. On January 7, 2022 (the "Acquisition Date"), we acquired SimpleNexus, a leading cloud-based mobile-first homeownership software company in the U.S.
nCino has achieved rapid growth since our inception over eleven years ago, and we plan to continue investing in and expanding the depth and breadth of our solutions. We believe our product development and global expansion initiatives will continue to drive revenue and customer growth and further enable the transformation of the financial services industry.
How the nCino Bank Operating System Works
The nCino Bank Operating System connects FI employees, their clients and third parties on a single, cloud-based platform, eliminating silos and bringing new levels of coordination and transparency to the FI. By utilizing a single platform across business lines, processes and channels, FIs are able to leverage the same data and information across their entire organization. This unified platform provides all the functionality necessary to complete mission-critical workflow, enabling client onboarding, loan origination, deposit account opening, analytics and compliance.
As a native cloud platform that utilizes a single code base regardless of the size and complexity of the FI, the nCino Bank Operating System is highly scalable and configurable for the specific needs of each customer. Once implemented, our solution becomes deeply embedded in our customers’ business processes, enabling workflow across the FI and allowing our customers to serve their clients anytime, anywhere, from any internet-enabled device. 
The nCino Bank Operating System also delivers data analytics and AI/ML capabilities through our nCino IQ ("nIQ") application suite to provide our customers with automation and insights into their operations, such as tools for analyzing, measuring and managing credit risk, as well as to improve their ability to comply with regulatory requirements.
Fundamental elements of the nCino Bank Operating System are built on Salesforce (the "Salesforce Platform"), which allows us to focus our product development efforts on building deep vertical functionality specifically for FIs, while leveraging Salesforce's global infrastructure, reliability and scalability. We also have certain solutions that leverage the Amazon Web Services ("AWS") platform.
We generally offer the nCino Bank Operating System on a subscription basis pursuant to non-cancellable multi-year contracts that typically range from three to five years, and we employ a “land and expand” business model. Our initial deployment with a customer generally focuses on implementing a client onboarding, loan origination and/or deposit account opening application in a specific line of business within the FI, such as commercial, small business or consumer. The nCino Bank Operating System is designed to scale with our customers, and once our solution is deployed, we seek to have our customers expand adoption within and across lines of business. 
Benefits and Features of the nCino Bank Operating System
The nCino Bank Operating System leverages common data sets and functionality across solutions, which optimizes and accelerates its deployment throughout a FI. These include: 
•Client Onboarding. Built into the nCino Bank Operating System is client onboarding functionality that supports the front, middle and back office onboarding process, allowing FIs to effectively evaluate the risk of doing business with a client, while also providing clients an efficient and personalized user experience. Clients are able to upload documents directly into the nCino Bank Operating System, complete identity verification and provide information about themselves and their business, offering a level of transparency to the FI that enables regulatory compliance, such as Know-Your-Customer (“KYC”). With enhanced onboarding reporting tools, FIs can generate customized reports and use real-time analytics and data from government watchlists and other third-party systems to achieve a holistic client view, enabling our customers to offer their clients more value-added services and custom-tailored offerings.
•Loan Origination. The loan origination functionality embedded within the nCino Bank Operating System combines an innovative and intuitive framework with automated workflow, checklists, document management, analytics and real-time reporting to provide a complete, end-to-end loan origination system from application, to underwriting, to adjudication, to document preparation, to closing. In one view, all stakeholders have visibility into where the loan process stands and what data is needed to complete the process. Post-closing, the nCino Bank Operating System provides a view into loan performance and tools for portfolio management, providing FI employees the ability to utilize information to maximize efficiency. Each stakeholder in the loan process works from a single digital loan file, allowing clients to apply for loans and upload documents; third parties, such as appraisers, lawyers and regulators, to access and review loan files; and employees to seamlessly manage the entire loan process efficiently and compliantly. Our loan origination functionality supports a wide range of lending products across commercial, small business and consumer lines of business. The nCino Bank Operating System can facilitate the origination of an FI’s most complex commercial lending products, including syndicated loans, commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans and construction loans, while also supporting the depth required for specific products such as agriculture lending, asset-based lending, SBA loans and leasing. Our solution also supports the speed and convenience required for small business and consumer loans across products, such as home equity lines of credit, home equity term loans, uncollateralized lines of credit, automobile loans and credit cards, while providing the tools needed to address regulatory compliance, including fair lending and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.
•Deposit Account Opening. The nCino Bank Operating System’s deposit account opening solution optimizes the process for opening checking, savings, debit/ATM cards, money market, certificates of deposit and retirement accounts. FIs can utilize nCino’s intuitive, scalable and flexible workflow to efficiently open consumer, commercial or small business accounts while maintaining individual account processes and requirements. Seamlessly embedded within the account opening experience, the nCino Bank Operating System provides the new client onboarding capability to collect KYC related information to meet compliance standards. The deposit account opening application allows clients to open an account digitally, across any device, in a branch or through a call center, with speed and flexibility.
•nIQ: The nCino Bank Operating System is powered by nIQ, which leverages AI/ML and analytics, helping FIs become more predictive, personalized and proactive. Through nIQ’s Automated Spreading feature, FIs can streamline manual data entry processes throughout the underwriting process and automatically capture more data, reducing the time it takes to spread and process documents and enabling bankers to devote more time to insightful financial analysis and focus on value-add activities. By combining newly available data from digitized processes with sophisticated profitability models, nIQ’s Commercial Pricing and Profitability functionality delivers targeted pricing insights at the point of decision, helping relationship managers intelligently price loans and win the right deals. FIs can also leverage the data visualization and predictive analytics capabilities of nIQ’s Portfolio Analytics solution to maintain a holistic view of portfolio trends, discover new lending opportunities, and proactively address risk within different segments. By embedding insights and automation into the loan lifecycle, nCino empowers FIs to accelerate revenue growth, improve operational efficiency and win the trust of their customers.
•Homeownership Platform. With the acquisition of SimpleNexus, nCino now offers a suite of products that enable loan officers, borrowers, real estate agents, settlement agents and others to easily engage in the homeownership process from any internet- enabled device. With Nexus Engagement™, FIs can collaborate with borrowers and real estate partners from the pre-application phase, offering relationship-building tools like payment calculators, integrated home search and instant chat that help convert more leads into closed loans. Nexus Origination™’s mobile-first toolset improves productivity and reduces cycle times by enabling loan officers to manage pipelines, run pricing, order credit reports, send pre-approval letters, sign disclosures and review automated underwriting system findings from anywhere while providing customers with a simple and modern journey to homeownership. Through integrations, Nexus Origination™ connects with mortgage loan origination systems, pricing engines, credit ordering systems, CRM solutions, appraisal management systems and other mortgage industry-related systems. Nexus Closing™ streamlines each FI’s preferred closing workflow, from traditional mortgage closings where documents are wet-signed in person, to fully digital eClosings with remote online notarization. Once a loan has closed, CompenSafe™ automatically calculates associated incentive compensation for loan officers, processors and operations staff for improved accuracy, transparency and compliance that reduces FIs’ administrative burden. Finally, throughout each phase of the homeownership journey, Nexus Vision™ provides business intelligence ("BI") that improves 
visibility and increases productivity across FIs’ lending operations. Nexus Vision’s visual dashboards, role-based scorecards, contextual comparisons and detailed drill-downs help FIs forecast revenue, identify and resolve production bottlenecks, prioritize loan teams’ activities and evaluate individual and branch performance with just a few clicks.
•A Powerful Ecosystem. By harnessing the power of diverse partners and leveraging open APIs and productized integrations, the nCino Bank Operating System creates a connected and scalable ecosystem that brings together disparate data sources and systems, acting as a data hub that integrates with core systems, credit reporting agencies and other third-party applications to centralize FI’s data, creating an actionable single data platform and warehouse. In addition, we work with some of the world’s leading technology and SI partners to help implement our solutions, which has increased our capacity to deliver and deploy the nCino Bank Operating System and enabled us to scale more quickly.
Our Customers 
As critical and attractive as our innovation platform is, it is our proven execution and delivery that makes nCino an ideal partner for innovative FIs. 
As the pioneer in cloud banking, we have developed trusted relationships and a reputation for successfully implementing our solutions with FIs of all sizes in multiple geographies. Our diverse customer base ranges from global FIs, such as Bank of America, Barclays, Santander Bank and TD Bank; to enterprise banks, such as KeyBank, Allied Irish Banks, First Horizon Bank and Truist Bank; to regional and community banks, such as Huntingdon Valley Bank, Arvest Bank and ConnectOne Bank; to credit unions, such as Navy Federal Credit Union, SAFE Credit Union, Golden1 Credit Union and Wright-Patt Credit Union; to new market entrants, such as OakNorth Bank, Recognise Bank and Judo Bank; to independent mortgage banks such as Synergy One Lending and Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation. These companies represent a cross-section of FIs across asset classes and geographies and each of these customers represent a substantial level of Annual Contract Value ("ACV") in its respective category.
As of January 31, 2023, we had over 420 FIs that have contracted for the nCino Bank Operating System for client onboarding, loan origination and/or deposit account opening. In addition, we have over 1,000 FIs that have contracted for our Portfolio Analytics solutions, which we acquired with the nCino Portfolio Analytics, LLC (formerly, Visible Equity, LLC, "Visible Equity") acquisition in fiscal 2020, and over 470 customers that have contracted with SimpleNexus. In total, we had over 1,850 customers as of January 31, 2023, of which 465 each generated more than $100,000 in subscription revenues in fiscal 2023. No single customer represented more than 10% of total revenues in fiscal 2023.
How nCino Will Grow
We intend to continue growing our business by executing on the following strategies:
•Expand Within and Across our Existing Customers. We believe there is a significant opportunity to further expand within our existing customer base both vertically within business lines and horizontally across business lines. Our revenues from existing customers continue to grow as additional users are added, creating strong customer cohort dynamics.
•Expand our Customer Base. We believe the global market for cloud banking is large and underserved. With FIs needing to replace legacy point products with modern technology and increased consumer demand for digital services, we believe there is a significant opportunity to deliver our solutions and expand our customer base to FIs of all sizes and complexities around the world. Currently deployed in 16 countries, we have made significant investments to expand our presence in EMEA and APAC, and the nCino Bank Operating System can currently support over 120 languages and over 140 currencies. We promote sales in North America out of our offices in the U.S. and Canada, in APAC out of our offices in Australia and Japan, and in EMEA primarily out of our office in the UK.
•Continue Strengthening and Extending our Product Functionality. We invested 29.8% of our revenues back into research and development in fiscal 2023 and plan to continue to invest to extend the depth and breadth of our solutions, while further enhancing its international capabilities. Additionally, we plan to continue to develop our portfolio analytics and credit modeling capabilities, as well as our AI/ML capabilities through automation, predictive analytics, digital assistant services and data source integration, and to continue 
to expand the functionality of the SimpleNexus digital homeownership platform. These innovations will further reduce the human resources required for routine but time-consuming tasks. 
•Foster and Grow our SI and Technology Ecosystem. We have developed strong relationships with a number of leading SIs, including Accenture, Deloitte, PwC, and West Monroe Partners, that increase our capacity to onboard new customers and implement the nCino Bank Operating System, extend our global reach and drive increased market awareness of our company and solutions. To date, over 2,500 trained SI consultants have completed our training program to implement the nCino Bank Operating System. Through the open architecture of the nCino Bank Operating System, an increasing number of third-party technology partners, including Rich Data Co., Alloy, Codat, Plaid, DocuSign, Mambu and OneSpan, among others, are integrated with our solution.
•Selectively Pursue Strategic Transactions. In addition to developing our solutions organically, we may selectively pursue acquisitions, joint ventures, or other strategic transactions. We expect these transactions to focus on innovation to help strengthen and expand the functionality and features of our solutions and/or expand our global presence. For example, in fiscal 2020 we acquired nCino Portfolio Analytics, LLC (formerly Visible Equity) and FinSuite Pty Ltd ("FinSuite") as part of our strategy to build out our nIQ capabilities, and we established our nCino K.K. joint venture to facilitate our entry into the Japanese market. Additionally, in January 2022, we completed our acquisition of SimpleNexus which expanded our capabilities to the U.S. mortgage market.
Our Relationship with Salesforce
From our inception, we built the nCino Bank Operating System on the Salesforce Platform to leverage its global infrastructure, reliability, and scalability. This strategy has allowed us to benefit from Salesforce’s investment in the continual improvement of the Salesforce Platform. We believe we have a mutually beneficial strategic relationship with Salesforce.
Salesforce Ventures, an affiliate of Salesforce, made investments in our common stock in January 2014, March 2015, July 2017, January 2018, and September 2019. As of January 31, 2023, Salesforce owned less than 5% of our common stock. 
Pursuant to our agreement with Salesforce (the "Salesforce Agreement"), when we sell our client onboarding, loan origination, and/or deposit account opening applications, we include a subscription to the underlying Salesforce Platform and remit a subscription fee to Salesforce. In exchange, Salesforce provides the hosting infrastructure and data center for these applications, as well as configuration, reporting, and other functionality within the Salesforce Platform. In addition, under the Salesforce Agreement, we are an authorized reseller of Salesforce’s CRM functionality to certain FIs in the U.S. Our original agreement with Salesforce was entered into in December 2011. On June 19, 2020, this agreement was superseded and replaced by the Salesforce Agreement which expires on June 19, 2027 unless earlier terminated by either party in the event of the other party’s material breach, bankruptcy, change in control in favor of a direct competitor, or intellectual property infringement. The Salesforce Agreement automatically renews for additional one-year periods thereafter unless notice of termination is provided. 
Sales and Marketing
Our sales team includes business development representatives, account executives, field sales engineers, and customer success managers. These teams are responsible for outbound lead generation, driving new business, and helping to manage account relationships and renewals, further driving adoption of our solutions within and across lines of business. These teams maintain close relationships with existing customers and act as an advisor to FIs to help identify and understand their unique needs, challenges, goals, and opportunities.
Our marketing teams oversee all aspects of nCino's global brand including brand strategy, public relations, integrated marketing, product marketing, marketing communications and marketing operations. Our marketing efforts span the full funnel from brand awareness building and pipeline generation to adoption and cross-sell. 
Customer Success
Once a customer contracts for one of our solutions, we provide configuration and implementation services to assist the customer in the deployment, either directly or through our SI partners. Configuration and implementation engagements typically range in duration from three to 18 months, depending on scope. For enterprise FIs, we generally work with SIs such as 
Accenture, Deloitte, and PwC. For regional FIs, we work with SIs such as West Monroe Partners, and for community banks we work with SIs or perform configuration and implementation ourselves. When we work with SIs, we generally field a small team of advisory consultants alongside the SIs to help ensure the success of the engagement. For SimpleNexus solutions, we directly provide configuration and implementation services in the deployment, which typically takes about three months.
We support our customers with 24/7 access to engineers and other technical support personnel, outcome based support offerings, release management, managed services, and technical support via online chat. To help our customers achieve success, we offer in-depth change management workshops, classroom and virtual end user and administrator training, consultative functionality adoption services, and best practices. The nCino Customer Success Management team is the customer’s central touch point, whose primary job is to manage the long-term health and success of each customer.
 A significant majority of our FI customers, whose employees utilize our client onboarding, loan origination, and/or deposit account opening applications, participate in our online nCino User Community. In the nCino User Community, users can access product guides, technical documents and support articles, engage and share best practices with other users and nCino subject matter experts through a variety of general and solution-focused discussion groups, suggest and vote for future product development ideas, and access training videos, materials and product certifications.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, and testing of our solutions. 
We utilize Agile software development methodologies and industry best practices, such as continuous integration/continuous deployment, automated testing and distributed version control, to develop new functionality and enhance our existing solutions. We provide opportunities for innovation through hackathons and new technology pilots, and we encourage customers to participate in our Product Design Programs to provide us with input on our product development roadmap. Our research and development spend was $121.6 million or 29.8% of total revenues in fiscal 2023.
Competition
Historically, the primary competition for the nCino Bank Operating System has been point solution vendors and systems developed internally by FIs. We believe our ability to provide client onboarding, loan origination, deposit account opening, analytics and AI/ML on a single platform across all lines of business, our deep banking domain expertise, our mobile-first homeownership platform, our reputation for high-quality professional services and customer support, and our strong company culture, distinguish us from our competition. We believe our success in growing our business will depend on our ability to demonstrate to FIs that our solutions provide superior business outcomes to those of third-party vendors or internally developed systems. In this regard, we are likely to be assessed on a number of factors, including:
•breadth and depth of functionality;
•ease of deployment, implementation and use;
•total cost of ownership and return on investment;
•level of customer satisfaction;
•brand awareness and reputation;
•cloud-based technology platform and pricing model;
•quality of implementation and customer support services;
•capability for configurability, integration, and scalability;
•domain expertise in banking technology;
•security and reliability;
•ability of our solutions to support compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;
•ability to innovate and respond to customer needs quickly;
•ability to integrate with third-party applications and systems; and
•insights and benchmarking derived from the cross-institution data and transactions that flow through our platform.
We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors but we expect competition to increase as existing competitors evolve their offerings and as new companies enter our market. Our ability to remain competitive will depend on our ongoing efforts in research and development, sales and marketing, professional services, customer support, and our business operations generally. For additional information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—The markets in which we participate are intensely competitive and highly fragmented, and pricing pressure, new technologies or other competitive dynamics could adversely affect our business and results of operations.”
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our core technology and innovations. We rely on federal, state, common law, and international rights, as well as contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties. We seek patent protection for certain of our key innovations, protocols, processes, and other inventions. We pursue the registration of our trademarks, service marks, and domain names in the U.S. and in certain other locations. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and still evolving. Furthermore, effective patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available.
As of January 31, 2023, we had 12 issued U.S. patents as well as one patent application pending in the U.S. We file patent applications where we believe there to be a strategic technological or business reason to do so. Although we actively attempt to utilize patents to protect our technologies, we believe that none of our patents, individually or in the aggregate, are material to our business.
Human Capital Management
We are in the business of fundamentally changing the way FIs operate. To transform an industry, we believe it is essential to foster a company culture that not only empowers its employees to challenge the status quo, but also emboldens them to drive change and champion customer success. 
Culture is a key differentiator for us; our position as the worldwide leader in cloud banking depends on the people who work at nCino. For these reasons, we have built our company with a cultural foundation based on six core values: Bring Your A-Game, Do the Right Thing, Respect Each Other, Make Someone’s Day, Have Fun and Be a Winner. We believe our culture is the foundation for the successful execution of our strategy and, as a result, is a critical strength of our organization. In recognition of our continued focus on employee engagement, satisfaction and culture, we have received numerous awards, including being named one of the Highest-Rated Public Cloud Computing Companies to Work For in 2021 by Battery Ventures. In 2022, nCino was also presented with 16 workplace-focused awards by Comparably, a leading workplace culture and compensation monitoring site, including Best CEOs for Diversity, Best Company for Women, Best Company Culture, Best Company Career Growth, Best Company Work-Life Balance and Best Company Happiness.
As of January 31, 2023, we had 1,791 employees, of which approximately 85% were in the U.S. and 15% were in other locations around the globe. We believe our employee engagement and experience remain strong. In January 2023, the company announced a workforce reduction of approximately seven percent (7%). Employees impacted by this event are included in our headcount as of January 31, 2023.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Community
As a global company whose employees represent a wide variety of identities across race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, ability and disability, class, immigration status and more, we know diverse identities, experiences and perspectives make for stronger teams. We believe we cannot realize our full strength unless we work collectively to acknowledge, respect, empathize with and appreciate each other's differences. To ensure that nCino remains rooted in our commitment to build a 
diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce, our talent acquisition strategy includes relationships with diverse professional organizations and minority colleges and universities.
To further our commitment to a culture of inclusiveness, our employee-led Diversity, Equality and Inclusion Council meets regularly with nCino’s Executive Leadership Team. In addition, nCino is home to six Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”), which serve our Veteran, LGBTQIA+, Latinx, AAPI, Black/African-American, and Women employee populations. These groups play an important role in building community and belonging among employees, providing resources to the broader nCino community, recruiting diverse talent and creating opportunities for professional development, mentorship and community outreach. Each ERG includes executive sponsorship and a connection to the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council.
nCino has a full-time Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Community Involvement leader who champions these initiatives and programs, with support and oversight from nCino’s CEO and People Operations leadership. As a result, nCino has been able to support many causes and initiatives in the community, such as sponsoring the local Martin Luther King, Jr. march, volunteering with veterans’ organizations that aid military personnel in their transition back to civilian life, and being a premier sponsor of an all-girls middle/high school that focuses primarily on STEM education.
In 2021, we also announced two long-term partnerships in Wilmington, North Carolina, where nCino’s headquarters is located. The first was a sponsorship with The City of Wilmington and the Wilmington Hammerheads Youth Soccer Club to help fund a new sports complex, which will help make sports more accessible to youth in the Wilmington community. The second was a partnership with the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina to support the development of the nCino Hunger Solutions Center, a new facility in Wilmington that will help the organization expand its food relief efforts and ensure substantial growth in its nutrition services, food access and distribution throughout southeastern North Carolina.
These are just some of the activities achieved through nCino's philanthropic and community service team, nVolve. Through nVolve, nCino prioritizes giving back to our communities and volunteering time by providing all global employees paid volunteer days separate from regular leave or holidays to support organizations and causes that are important to them.
Total Reward, Well-being & Experience
nCino believes that productivity is driven by employees who are actively engaged, both by their connection to our purpose and their certainty that the company cares about their well-being. We therefore invest in their financial, social and physical wellness as well as the communities in which they work.
Because nCino’s future success is dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, we offer competitive compensation, opportunities for equity ownership, retirement plans to help employees invest in their future and generous, country-specific benefit packages. In addition, we offer competitive parental leaves, holiday pay, student debt repayment programs and vacation time and flex holidays. nCino supports healthy lifestyles and wellness by offering office step challenges, nutritious snacks, standing and treadmill desks, financial education, mental health initiatives, cycle to work programs, on-site flu shots, recreational outings and more.
These offerings demonstrate a commitment to our employees’ well-being and play a critical role in engaging and retaining the talented individuals that comprise our organization.
Technology, Development and Cloud Operations
We deliver our solutions as highly scalable cloud computing application and platform services on a multi-tenant technology architecture. Multi-tenancy is an architectural approach that allows us to operate a single application instance for multiple organizations, treating all customers as separate and virtual isolation from each other. This approach allows us to spread the cost of delivering our services across the globe and scale our business faster than traditional software vendors while focusing our resources on building new functionality and enhancing existing offerings.
Our technology and product efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features, functionality, performance, availability, and security of our existing service offerings, as well as developing new features, functionality, and services. We also remain focused on integrating businesses, services and technologies from acquisitions and with partners.
Global Financial Service Providers Are Highly Regulated
Global financial service providers and their solutions are subject to extensive and complex data, security and regulatory guidance and oversight by international, country, federal, state and other regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and affect the conduct of financial service providers operations and, as a result, the business of their technology providers. The compliance process with these regulatory requirements depends on a variety of factors, including functionality and design, the classification of the financial service provider and its services, region or country of operation, and the manner in which the financial service provider and its end users utilize the solutions. In order to ensure compliance with these laws, financial service providers may be required to implement operating policies and procedures to protect the privacy and security of their, the financial service providers', and their end users' information, and to undergo periodic audits and examinations. 
Security Is Paramount for Global Financial Service Providers
The risks of cybercrime and fraud have always existed in banking and financial services. As the adoption and use of digital channels increase in financial services, the incidence of cybercrime and fraud has grown substantially. The methods by which criminals seek to commit fraud are constantly changing, requiring financial services providers and their technology providers to continually modify their security protocols and best practices. Providing services to FIs requires experience, constant vigilance, and continuous investment to stay informed and guard against these ever-changing threats.
