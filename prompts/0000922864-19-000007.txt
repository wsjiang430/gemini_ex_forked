Item 1. Business
The Company
Apartment Investment and Management Company, or Aimco, is a Maryland corporation incorporated on January 10, 1994. Aimco is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, focused on the ownership, management, redevelopment and limited development of quality apartment communities located in some of the largest markets in the United States. 
2

Aimco, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, AIMCO-GP, Inc. and AIMCO-LP Trust, owns a majority of the ownership interests in AIMCO Properties, L.P., or the Aimco Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership formed on May 16, 1994. Aimco conducts all of its business and owns all of its assets through the Aimco Operating Partnership.
Business Overview
Our business activities are defined by a commitment to our core values of integrity, respect, collaboration, performance and a focus on our customers. These values and our corporate mission, “to consistently provide quality apartment homes in a respectful environment delivered by a team of people who care,” shape our culture. In all of our interactions with residents, team members, business partners, lenders, and equity holders, we aim to be the best owner and operator of apartment communities and an outstanding corporate citizen.
Our principal financial objective is to provide predictable and attractive returns to our equity holders. We measure our long- term total return using Economic Income, defined as Net Asset Value, or NAV, growth plus dividends. NAV is used by many investors because the value of company assets can be readily estimated, even for non-earning assets such as land or properties under development. NAV has the advantage of incorporating the investment decisions of thousands of real estate investors, enhancing comparability among companies that have differences in their accounting, and avoiding disparity that can result from application of GAAP to investment properties and various ownership structures. Some investors focus on multiples of Adjusted Funds From Operations, or AFFO, and Funds From Operations, FFO. Our disclosure of AFFO, a measure of current return, complements our focus on Economic Income. We also use Pro forma Funds From Operations, or Pro forma FFO, as a secondary measure of operational performance. Over the past five years, we have generated Economic Income at a compounded annual return of 11.5%. Our business plan to achieve this principal financial objective is to: 

• | operate our portfolio of desirable apartment homes with a high level of focus on customer selection and customer satisfaction and in an efficient manner that produces predictable and growing Free Cash Flow;


• | improve our portfolio of apartment communities, which is diversified both by geography and price point by selling apartment communities with lower projected Free Cash Flow internal rates of return and investing the proceeds from such sales through capital enhancements, redevelopment, limited development, and acquisitions with greater land value, higher expected rent growth, and projected Free Cash Flow internal rates of return in excess of those expected from the communities sold;


• | use low levels of financial leverage primarily in the form of non-recourse, long-dated, fixed-rate property debt and perpetual preferred equity, a combination that reduces our refunding and re-pricing risk and provides a hedge against increases in interest rates; and


• | focus intentionally on a collaborative and productive culture based on respect for others and personal responsibility.

Our business is organized around five areas of strategic focus: operational excellence; redevelopment; portfolio management; balance sheet; and team and culture. Our areas of strategic focus are described in more detail below. Recent accomplishments in the execution of such strategies are discussed in the Executive Overview in Item 7.
Operational Excellence
We own and operate a portfolio of market rate apartment communities, diversified by both geography and price point, which we refer to as our Real Estate portfolio. At December 31, 2018, our Real Estate portfolio included 134 apartment communities with 36,549 apartment homes in which we held an average ownership of approximately 99%. This portfolio was divided about two thirds by value to our “Same Store” portfolio of stabilized apartment communities and about one third by value to “Other Real Estate,” which includes recently acquired communities and communities under redevelopment or development whose long-term financial contribution is not yet stabilized.
To manage our property operations efficiently and to increase the benefits from our local management expertise, we give direct responsibility for operations within each area to area operations leaders with regular oversight by senior management. To enable the area operations leaders to focus on sales and service, as well as to improve financial control and budgeting, we have dedicated area financial officers who support the operations leaders. Additionally, with the exception of routine maintenance and purchases and installation of equipment, we have specialized teams that manage capital spending related to larger and more complicated construction. 
We seek to improve our property operations by: employing service-oriented, well-trained team members; taking advantage of advances in technology; centralizing operational tasks where efficient to do so; standardizing business processes, operational measurements, and internal reporting; and enhancing financial controls over field operations. We focus on the following areas:
3


• | Customer Satisfaction. Our operating culture is focused on our residents and providing them with a high level of service in a clean, safe, and respectful living environment. We regularly monitor and evaluate our performance by providing customers with numerous opportunities to grade our work. In 2018, we received 78,000 customer grades averaging 4.25 on a five-point scale. We use this customer feedback as a daily management tool. We also publish on-line these customer evaluations as important and credible information for prospective customers. We have automated certain aspects of our on-site operations to enable current and future residents to interact with us using methods that are efficient and effective for them, such as making on-line requests for service work and executing leases and lease renewals on-line. In addition, we emphasize the quality of our on-site team members through recruiting, training and retention programs, which, with continuous and real-time customer feedback, contributes to improved customer service. We believe that greater customer satisfaction leads to higher resident retention and increased occupancy rates, which in turn leads to increased revenue and reduced costs.


• | Resident Selection and Retention. In our apartment communities, we believe that one’s neighbors are a meaningful part of the customer experience, together with the location of the community and the physical quality of the apartment homes. Part of our property operations strategy is to focus on attracting and retaining stable, credit-worthy residents who are also good neighbors. We have explicit criteria for resident selection, which we apply to new and renewal leases, including creditworthiness and behavior in accordance with our community standards and our written “Good Neighbor Commitment.” Our focus on resident selection and retention led to 54% of expiring leases being renewed in 2018, the highest result we have yet achieved.


• | Revenue Management and Ancillary Services. We have a centralized revenue management system that leverages people, processes and technology to work in partnership with our local property management teams to develop rental rate pricing. We seek to increase Free Cash Flow, which we define as net operating income less Capital Replacements, by optimizing the balance between rental and occupancy rates, as well as taking into consideration costs such as preparing an apartment home for a new resident. We are focused on careful measurements of on-site operations, as we believe that timely and accurate collection of apartment community performance and resident profile data allows us to maximize Free Cash Flow through better property management and leasing decisions. We seek to maximize profit by performing timely data analysis of new and renewal pricing for each apartment home, thereby enabling us to adjust rents quickly in response to changes in supply and demand and minimize vacancy time. We also generate incremental revenue by providing or facilitating the provision of services to our residents, including, at certain apartment communities, telecommunications services, parking options, package lockers and storage space rental.


• | Controlling Expenses. Innovation is the foundation of our cost control efforts. Innovative activities we have undertaken include: moving administrative tasks to our shared service center, which reduces costs and allows site teams to focus on sales and service; taking advantage of economies of scale at the corporate level, through electronic procurement which reduces complexity and increases purchasing volume discounts; focusing on life cycle costs by investing in more durable, longer-lived materials, which reduce turn times and costs; and leveraging technology to enhance the customer experience through such items as website design and package lockers, which meet today’s customer preference for self-service. These and other innovations contributed to a growth rate in controllable operating expense, which we define as property expenses less taxes, insurance and utility expenses, compounding for the past decade at an annual rate of 0.1%.


• | Improving and Maintaining Apartment Community Quality. We believe that the physical condition and amenities of our apartment communities are important factors in our ability to maintain and increase rental rates. We invest in the maintenance and improvement of our apartment communities primarily through: Capital Enhancements, which may include kitchen and bath remodeling, energy conservation projects and investments in longer-lived materials as described above, all of which are generally lesser in scope than is a redevelopment and do not significantly disrupt property operations; Capital Improvements, which extend the useful life of an apartment community from its condition at our date of purchase; and Capital Replacements, which are capital additions made to replace the portion of an apartment community consumed during our ownership. During 2018, we invested approximately $2,890 per apartment home in Capital Enhancements, $4,670 per apartment home in Capital Improvements planned as part of our initial investment in apartment communities acquired in 2018, $270 per apartment home in Capital Improvements for apartment communities acquired prior to 2018, and $1,052 per apartment home in Capital Replacements.

Redevelopment
Our second line of business is the redevelopment and limited development of apartment communities. Through these activities, we expect to create value by repositioning communities within our portfolio. Over the past five years, we have spent approximately $1.0 billion on redevelopment and development, resulting in estimated value creation of approximately $400.0 million. We measure the rate and quality of financial returns by NAV creation, an important component of Economic Income, our primary measure of 
4

long-term financial performance. We invest to earn risk-adjusted returns in excess of those expected from the apartment communities sold in paired trades to fund the redevelopment or development. 
We undertake a range of redevelopments, including those in which buildings or exteriors are renovated without the need to vacate apartment homes; those in which significant renovation of apartment homes may be accomplished upon lease expiration and turnover; and those in which an entire building or community is vacated. We often execute redevelopment using a phased approach, in which we renovate an apartment community in stages. Redevelopment work may include seeking entitlements from local governments, which enhance the value of our existing portfolio by increasing density, that is, the right to add apartment homes to a site.
We also undertake ground-up development when warranted by risk-adjusted investment returns, either directly or in connection with the redevelopment of an existing apartment community. When warranted, we rely on the expertise and credit of a third-party developer familiar with the local market to limit our exposure to construction risk. Of these two activities, we favor redevelopment because it permits adjustment to the scope and timing of spending to align with changing market conditions and customer preferences.
Portfolio Management
Our portfolio management strategy involves the allocation of investment capital to enhance rent growth and increase long-term capital values through portfolio design, emphasizing land value as well as location and submarket. We target geographic diversification in our portfolio in order to reduce the volatility of our rental revenue and to reduce the risk of undue concentration in any particular market. Similarly, we seek price point diversification by owning communities that offer apartment homes at rents below those asked by competitive new building supply.
Our portfolio of apartment communities is diversified across “A,” “B,” and “C+” price points, averaging “B/B+” in quality and is also diversified across several of the largest markets in the United States. Please refer to the Executive Overview heading under Item 7 for a description of our portfolio quality ratings. At December 31, 2018, our Real Estate portfolio was allocated about one-half to “A” rated properties, and about one-half to “B” and “C+” rated properties. 
As part of our portfolio strategy, we seek to sell up to 10% of our portfolio annually and to reinvest the proceeds from such sales in accretive uses such as capital enhancements, redevelopments, limited development and selective acquisitions with projected Free Cash Flow internal rates of return higher than expected from the communities being sold. 
Balance Sheet
Our leverage strategy seeks to magnify financial returns while using leverage with appropriate caution. We limit risk through balance sheet structure, employing low leverage, primarily non-recourse and long-dated property debt; build financial flexibility by maintaining ample unused and available credit as well as holding properties with substantial value unencumbered by property debt; and use partners’ capital when it enhances financial returns or reduces investment risk.
Our leverage includes our share of long-term, non-recourse, property debt encumbering apartment communities, outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and outstanding preferred equity. 
We target a ratio of Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDA below 7.0x and we target a ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends greater than 2.5x. Our ratios as of December 31, 2018 were 7.2x and 3.4x, respectively.
Our liquidity consists of cash balances and available capacity on our revolving line of credit. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and restricted cash of $72.6 million and had capacity to borrow $632.5 million under our revolving credit facility.
We manage our financial flexibility by maintaining an investment grade rating and holding apartment communities that are unencumbered by property debt. As of December 31, 2018, we held unencumbered apartment communities with an estimated fair market value of approximately $2.7 billion, up 50% from December 31, 2017.
Please refer to the Executive Overview and Liquidity and Capital Resources headings under Item 7 for additional information regarding our balance sheet and liquidity.
Team and Culture
Our team and culture are keys to our success. Our intentional focus on a collaborative and productive culture based on respect for others and personal responsibility is reinforced by a preference for promotion from within. We focus on succession planning and talent development to produce a strong, stable team that is the enduring foundation of our success. In 2018, we were recognized 
5

by the Denver Post as a Top Work Place for the sixth consecutive year, an accomplishment shared with only seven other companies in Colorado.
Competition
In attracting and retaining residents to occupy our apartment communities we compete with numerous other housing providers. Our apartment communities compete directly with other rental apartments as well as condominiums and single-family homes that are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our apartment communities are located. Principal factors of competition include rent or price charged, attractiveness of the location and apartment community, and the quality and breadth of services. The number of competitive apartment communities relative to demand in a particular area has a material effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our communities and on the rents we charge. In certain markets, there exists an oversupply of newly-constructed apartment homes, single-family homes, and condominiums relative to consumer demand, which affects the pricing and occupancy of our rental apartments. 
We also compete with other real estate investors, including other apartment REITs, pension and investment funds, partnerships and investment companies in acquiring, redeveloping, managing, obtaining financing for and disposing of apartment communities. This competition affects our ability to acquire apartment communities we want to add to our portfolio and the price that we pay in such acquisitions; our ability to finance or refinance communities in our portfolio and the cost of such financing; and our ability to dispose of communities we no longer desire to retain in our portfolio and the timing and price available to us when we seek to dispose of such communities.
Taxation 
Aimco
Aimco has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1994, and intends to continue to operate in such a manner. The Code imposes various requirements related to organizational structure, distribution levels, diversity of stock ownership, and certain restrictions with regard to owned assets and categories of income that must be met in order to continue to qualify as a REIT. If Aimco continues to qualify for taxation as a REIT, Aimco will generally not be subject to United States federal corporate income tax on its taxable income that is currently distributed to stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the “double taxation” (at the corporate and stockholder levels) that generally results from an investment in a corporation.
Certain of Aimco’s operations or a portion thereof, including property management and risk management are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries, each of which we refer to as a TRS. A TRS is a subsidiary C-corporation that has not elected REIT status and, as such, is subject to United States federal corporate income tax. We use TRS entities to facilitate our ability to offer certain services and activities to our residents and investment partners that cannot be offered directly by a REIT. We also use TRS entities to hold investments in certain apartment communities. 
The Aimco Operating Partnership
The Aimco Operating Partnership is treated as a “pass-through” entity for United States federal income tax purposes and is not subject to United States federal income taxation. Partners in the Aimco Operating Partnership, however, are subject to tax on their allocable share of partnership income, gains, losses, deductions and credits, regardless of whether the partners receive any actual distributions of cash or other property from the Aimco Operating Partnership during the taxable year. Generally, the characterization of any particular item is determined by the Aimco Operating Partnership, rather than at the partner level, and the amount of a partner’s allocable share of such item is governed by the terms of the Aimco Operating Partnership’s Partnership Agreement. The Aimco Operating Partnership is subject to tax in certain states.
Regulation
General
Apartment communities and their owners are subject to various laws, ordinances, and regulations, including those related to real estate broker licensing and regulations relating to recreational facilities such as swimming pools, activity centers and other common areas. Changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on apartment communities or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions, as well as changes in laws affecting development, construction, and safety requirements, may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely affect our net income and cash flows from operating activities. In addition, existing rent control laws, as well as future enactment of rent control or rent stabilization laws, or other laws regulating multifamily housing, may reduce rental revenue or increase operating costs in particular markets.
6

Environmental 
Various federal, state and local laws subject apartment community owners or operators to liability for management, and the costs of removal or remediation, of certain potentially hazardous materials that may be present at an apartment community. These materials may include lead-based paint, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls and petroleum-based fuels. Such laws often impose liability without regard to fault or whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such materials. In connection with the ownership, operation and management of apartment communities, we could potentially be liable for environmental liabilities or costs associated with our current apartment communities, communities we acquire or manage in the future, or communities we previously owned or operated in the past. These and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Insurance
Our primary lines of insurance coverage are property, general liability and workers’ compensation. We believe that our insurance coverages adequately insure our apartment communities against the risk of loss attributable to fire, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood, terrorism and other perils, and adequately insure us against other risk. Our coverage includes deductibles, retentions and limits that are customary in the industry. We have established loss prevention, loss mitigation, claims handling and litigation management procedures to manage our exposure.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,050 team members, of whom about 700 were at the apartment community level performing on-site functions or at our shared service center performing tasks that have been centralized there, with the balance managing corporate and area functions, including investment and debt transactions, legal, finance and accounting, information systems, human resources and other support functions. As of December 31, 2018, unions represented approximately 50 of our team members. We have never experienced a work stoppage and believe we maintain satisfactory relations with our team members. 
Available Information
