Corporate Structure 
 
Organic Agricultural Company Limited (“Organic Agricultural”, the “Company”, “we” or “us”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 17, 2018. Our website address is www.oacl.top. Our website and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, the website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and is not considered part of, this Report.
 
The Company, through its subsidiaries with headquarters in Harbin, China, grows and sells unmilled rice (“paddy”) and selenium-enriched paddy products, rice and other agricultural products. The Company is currently re-orienting its efforts to emphasize the sale of selenium-enriched paddy. We believe that the importance of selenium to human health and the fact of dietary selenium deficiency in large parts of China create a vast market potential for development. The Company’s subsidiaries include:

Our present corporate structure is as follows:
 


Our Business
 
Selenium is one of the “essential” nutrients for humans, meaning that our bodies cannot produce it, and so we have to get it from our diet. Selenium deficiency can cause health problems including Keshan’s disease, a form of cardiomyopathy. The World Health Organization has found that between 50 and 250 micrograms of selenium constitute a healthy daily intake.

Scientists now know selenium is necessary in the body’s production of selenoproteins, a family of proteins that contain selenium in the form of an amino acid. So far, 25 different selenoproteins in the body have been isolated, but only half of their functions have been identified. Selenium is one of several nutrients known to have antioxidant properties, meaning selenium plays a part in chemical reactions that stop free radicals from damaging cells and DNA. Human and animal research has found selenoproteins are involved in embryo development, thyroid hormone metabolism, antioxidant defense, sperm production, muscle function and the immune system’s response to vaccinations. Antioxidant supplements, including selenium, are often touted to help prevent heart disease, cancer and vision loss.
 
According to the Chinese Selenium Supplements Association, selenium is purported to help people with asthma, and reduce the risk of rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular disease. Selenium levels drop with age, so some have claimed selenium can slow the aging process, cognitive decline and dementia. Low selenium levels are also implicated in depression, male infertility, weak immune systems and thyroid problems.
 
Plants grown in soil containing selenium convert it into a form that is usable to humans and animals. Soil around the world varies in its selenium concentration. The higher the concentration of selenium in soil, the higher the concentration of selenium is in crops. Soil in Nebraska, South and North Dakota, for example, is especially rich in selenium, and people living in these areas typically have the highest dietary intake of selenium in the United States. On the other hand, Seventy-two percent (72%) of the land in China is selenium-poor. In the area from the three provinces in Northeast China to the Yunnan Guizhou plateau, two-thirds of the arable land is recognized as having selenium deficiency, where the selenium content of the principal crops is less than 0.05ppm.
 
Because rice is a staple food in China, selenium-enriched rice obtained by bioenrichment to increase the selenium content of rice was determined to be a good selenium source for the population in selenium-deficient regions. The government of China permits rice to be labeled “selenium-enriched” if the selenium content is at least 0.04 mg/kg. Rice with a selenium concentration in excess of 0.3 mg/kg is considered dangerous and may not be sold. Lvxin’s current inventory of paddy has an average selenium content of 0.18 mg/kg. A half cup of steamed rice (an average serving) made from paddy with a selenium content of 0.18 mg/kg will contain approximately 0.015 mg (i.e. 15 micrograms) selenium.
 
Our subsidiary, Lvxin, has been involved in growing, threshing and selling unmilled rice since 2012, using leased farmland and the part-time labor of local farmers. Lvxin’s farming operations take place in Baoqing County of Heilongjiang Province in a region known as the Sanjiang Plain. This part of Sanjiang Plain is noteworthy for, among other things, the relatively high content of selenium in its soil. By focusing on production of selenium-enhanced rice, Lvxin hopes to develop a sustainable position in the Chinese rice market.
 
Our other subsidiary, Yuxinqi, was organized in February 2018, and recorded its first sales during the quarter ended December 31, 2018. Yuxinqi will devote its efforts to marketing and distribution of selenium-enriched agricultural products, initially the selenium-enriched paddy grown by Lvxin, but in time hopes to acquire and distribute a range of selenium-enriched agricultural products.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business is seasonal, as our sales are generally during the harvest season, which occurs from October to March of the following year. Our sales are typically very low from April to September, which is the planting and growing period. Accordingly, we experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and our operating costs.
 
In addition, adverse weather conditions and other natural disasters may affect our planting and harvesting activities and cause a reduction and loss of agricultural production or a delay in realization of revenues.

A major reason for our development of Yuxinqi is to offset the seasonality of our rice business with the year-round marketing efforts of Yuxinqi. We intend that Yuxinqi will market value-added products, both products based on rice and products based on other food stuffs, such as organic red beans and millet.
 
Operating Licenses
 
Our products and services are subject to regulation by governmental agencies in the PRC and Heilongjiang Province. Business and company registrations, along with the products, are certified on a regular basis and must be in compliance with the laws and regulations of the PRC and provincial and local governments and industry agencies, which are controlled and monitored through the issuance of licenses. Our licenses include:

● | Tianci Liangtian and Yuxinqi operating licenses enable us to undertake agricultural technology development services, primary processing of agricultural products, grain and legume cultivation, and agricultural products sales. (Legally approved projects can be launched after approval by the relevant departments). The registration numbers are 91230100MA1ATNP757 and 91230109MA1AYU4P51, respectively; and they are valid from November 2, 2017 and February 5, 2018, respectively, with no expiration date.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lvxin’s operating license enables us to plant rice, as well as to carry out technical exchanges and information consultation services related to paddy planting. The registration number is 93230523588124513U and it is valid from February 9, 2012 with no expiration date.

Competition
 
Currently, the production of selenium-enriched paddy in China is the province of small and medium-sized enterprises, with no dominant participant in the market. The diversity of the market is primarily a function of the relatively brief period that the concept of producing selenium-enriched food stuffs has been popular. As the concept becomes more well-established, the emergence of market leaders will be likely.
 
We are a small company. However, with our recent focus on production of selenium-enriched paddy, we are entering a growing market. We believe that we will be able to compete effectively in this market because we have the following advantages:
 

● | Geographical advantages 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

 
Lvxin is located in the hinterland of the Sanjiang Plain in Heilongjiang Province. The Sanjiang Plain is one of the world’s most famous areas of fertile soil and one of China’s three largest selenium-enriched belts.
 

● | Product specificity 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our business activities are focused exclusively on the production of paddy, particularly selenium-enriched paddy. Because selenium-enriched paddy has certain differences with ordinary paddy cultivation, and the technical requirements for effective growing are relatively high, we have invited specialized technical personnel to provide guidance and realize scientific farming.
 
Suppliers
 
Over the years of operations, we have developed a solid and reliable image and reputation with the suppliers. We have established supplier relationships with several local companies.

Marketing
 
We believe that the importance of selenium to human health and the fact of selenium deficiency in large parts of China create a vast market potential for development. Selenium has been studied extensively in China. These efforts have resulted in confirming that selenium is an important element for human health and that there are areas within China that are significantly deficient in the soil and water. In the past decade, Chinese government policy has helped to enhance the importance of selenium and the potential of the selenium market.
 
As the market for the Company’s paddy becomes stable, and as resources become available, the Company intends to expand its product offerings to include value-added products, both products based on rice and products based on other food stuffs, such as organic red beans and millet. In this manner, the Company hopes to alleviate the seasonality of its revenues, by having products available for sale year-round.
 
Insurance
 
We do not maintain fire, theft, product liability or other insurance of any kind. We bear the economic risk with respect to loss of or damage or destruction to our property and to the interruption of our business as well as liability to third parties for damage or destruction to them or their property that may be caused by our personnel or products.
Income Taxes
 
United States
 
On December 22, 2017, the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (“The Act”) was enacted. Under the provisions of the Act, the U.S. corporate tax rate decreased from 34% to 21%. Accordingly, we have remeasured our deferred tax assets on our net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S at the lower enacted tax rate of 21%. However, this remeasurement had no effect on our income tax expense as we have provided a 100% valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets.
Samoa
 
Organic Agricultural (Samoa) Co., Ltd was incorporated in Samoa and, under the current laws of Samoa, is not subject to income tax.
 
China
 
Tianci Liantian and Yuxinqi are subject to a 25% standard enterprise income tax in the PRC. There was no provision for income taxes for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 due to operating losses.
 
Lvxin product sales and services have been exempt from enterprise income tax, according to the “PRC Income Tax Law” Article 27 (1), which states that income from agricultural, forestry, animal husbandries and fisheries industries shall be exempt from business income tax.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2019, we had 33 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or similar collective bargaining organization.
 
During the growing and harvest seasons, Lvxin hires approximately 190 local farmers on a part-time basis to assist in the farming operations.
