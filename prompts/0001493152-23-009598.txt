Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
We are a medical device company focusing on the development and commercialization of our proprietary MicroNet™ stent platform for the treatment of carotid artery disease and other vascular disease. A stent is an expandable “scaffold-like” device, usually constructed of a metallic material, that is inserted into the lumen of the artery to create patency and revascularization of blood flow. MicroNet, a micron mesh sleeve, is attached over a stent to provide embolic protection both during and after stenting procedures.
 
Our CGuard™ carotid embolic prevention system (“CGuard EPS™”) combines MicroNet and a unique self-expandable nitinol stent in a single device for use in carotid artery revascularization. Our CGuard EPS originally received CE mark approval under Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC (“MDD”) in the European Union (“EU”) in March 2013 and was fully launched in Europe in September 2015. Subsequently, we launched CGuard EPS in over 30 countries and on February 3, 2021, we executed a distribution agreement with Chinese partners for the purpose of expanding our presence in the Asian markets. Currently, we are seeking strategic partners for a potential launch of CGuard EPS in Japan and other Asian countries.
 
Our CE mark for CGuard EPS under the MDD expired on November 12, 2022 and we are in the final stages of technical documentation review by the Notified Body auditor to meet the Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) (MDR 2017/745) requirements (which replaced the MDD) for recertification. In the meantime, on February 14, 2023, we received a derogation per Article 97 paragraph 1 of Regulation 2017/745 from the Agency for Medicines and Health Products (FAMHP) allowing us to continue marketing CGuard EPS in the EU until August 15, 2023 subject to certain procedural requirements. Subsequently, on March 20, 2023, Regulation (EU) 2023/607 was published allowing us to continue marketing CGuard EPS in EU countries under the MDD directive until December 31, 2027. As a result of the foregoing, we may market and sell CGuard EPS in the EU and certain other jurisdictions subject to certain procedural requirements while our MDR CE recertification is pending. We continue to expedite the review process for recertification under the MDR.
 
On September 8, 2020, we received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) of our Investigation Device Exemption (“IDE”), thereby allowing us to proceed with a pivotal study of our CGuard™ Carotid Stent System, C-Guardians, for prevention of stroke in patients in the United States. C-Guardians is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, pivotal study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the CGuard™ Carotid Sten System when used to treat symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in patients undergoing carotid artery stenting. The trial was designed to enroll approximately 315 subjects in a maximum of 40 study sites located in the United States and Europe. Study sites in Europe may contribute a maximum of approximately 50% of the total enrollees. The primary endpoint of the study will be the composite of incidence of death (all-cause mortality), all stroke, and myocardial infarction (DSMI) through 30-days post-index procedure, based on the clinical events committee (CEC) adjudication and ipsilateral stroke from 31-365 day follow-up, based on Clinical Events Committee (CEC) adjudication. The composite index will be compared to a performance goal based on the observed rate of the two components of the primary endpoint from previous pivotal stent trials which are considered industry standard. The performance goal will be considered met if the upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval calculated from the observed primary endpoint rate is < 11.6% and the p-value is less than 0.025.

On July 23, 2021, we announced the initiation of enrollment and successful completion of the first cases of our C-Guardian trial of CGuard EPS. These are 315 patients who are expected to be enrolled in the trial and receive CGuard EPS in the treatment of carotid artery stenosis in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients undergoing carotid artery stenting. We are currently continuing with the enrolment phase at approximately 20 trial sites and expect it to be completed approximately at the end of the second quarter of 2023.
 
Additionally, we intend to continue to invest in current and future potential new indications, products and manufacturing enhancements for CGuard EPS that are expected to reduce cost of goods and/or provide the best-in-class performing delivery systems, such as CGuard Prime™for transfemoral access. In furtherance of our strategy that focuses on establishing CGuard EPS as a viable alternative to vascular surgery, we are developing a new transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) delivery system, SwitchGuard™, for transcarotid access and neuro protection. In addition, we intend to explore new indications for CGuard EPS to leverage the advantages of stent design and mesh protection, well suited in labels such as acute stroke with tandem lesions.
 
We consider our current addressable market for our CGuard EPS to be individuals with diagnosed, symptomatic high-grade carotid artery stenosis (HGCS, ≥70% occlusion) for whom intervention is preferable to medical (drug) therapy. This group includes not only carotid artery stenting patients but also individuals undergoing carotid endarterectomy, as the two approaches compete for the same patient population. Assuming full penetration of the intervention caseload by CGuard EPS, we estimate that the addressable market for CGuard EPS will be approximately $1.3 billion in 2023 (source: Health Research International Personal Medical Systems, Inc. September 13, 2021 Results of Update Report on Global Carotid Stenting Procedures and Markets by Major Geography and Addressable Markets and internal estimates). According to this same report, and internal estimates, assuming full penetration of the caseload for all individuals diagnosed with high-grade carotid artery stenosis, we estimate that the total available market for CGuard EPS in 2022 will be approximately $9.3 billion. Our mission is to offer a comprehensive set of delivery solutions (TCAR and Transfemoral) in order to deliver best in class results through patient outcomes by way of stent performance with CGuard EPS.
 
We were organized in the State of Delaware on February 29, 2008.
 
Our Industry
 
Carotid
 
Carotid arteries are located on each side of the neck and provide the primary blood supply to the brain. Carotid artery disease, also called carotid artery stenosis, is a type of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) that is one of the major risk factors for ischemic stroke. In carotid artery disease, plaque accumulates in the artery walls, narrowing the artery and disrupting the blood supply to the brain. This disruption in blood supply, together with plaque debris breaking off the artery walls and traveling to the brain, are the primary causes of stroke. According to the World Health Organization (https://www.who.int/cardiovascular_diseases/resources/atlas/en/) every year, 15 million people worldwide suffer a stroke, and nearly six million die and another five million are left permanently disabled. According to the same source, stroke is the second leading cause of disability, after dementia.

In 2022, 3.0 million people between the age of 50 and 89 years old were estimated to be diagnosed with high grade carotid artery disease, of which, approximately 394,000 of those diagnosed required intervention for carotid artery disease (according to the Health Research International Personal Medical Systems, Inc. September 13, 2021 Results of Update Report on Global Carotid Stenting Procedures and Markets by Major Geography and Addressable Markets). There are three current intervention treatments used for carotid artery disease. The first is a carotid endarterectomy where a surgeon accesses the blocked carotid artery though an incision in the neck, and then surgically removes the plaque. The second is transcarotid artery revascularization where a surgeon accesses the blocked carotid artery though an incision in the neck, and then surgically removes the plaque while combining high-rate blood flow reversal to protect the brain. The third is carotid artery stenting, which is a minimally invasive endovascular treatment for carotid artery disease and an alternative to carotid endarterectomy. Endovascular techniques using stents and carotid embolic prevention system protect against plaque and debris traveling downstream, blocking off the vessel and disrupting blood flow. We believe that the use of a stent with an embolic protection system should increase the number of patients being treated since it would avoid the need for complex surgery.
 
Our Products and Product Candidates
 
MicroNet Mesh Platform Technology
 
MicroNet is our proprietary circular knitted mesh which wraps around a stent to protect patients from plaque debris flowing downstream upon deployment. MicroNet is made of a single fiber from a biocompatible polymer widely used in medical implantations. The size, or aperture, of the current MicroNet ‘pore’ is only 150-180 microns in order to maximize protection against the potentially dangerous plaque and thrombus. The MicroNet mesh is the core technology around which we have developed products for specific applications.
 
CGuard EPS – Carotid Artery Applications
 
Our CGuard EPS combines our MicroNet mesh and a self-expandable nitinol stent (a stent that expands without balloon dilation pressure or need of an inflation balloon) in a single device for use in carotid artery applications. MicroNet is placed over and attached to an open cell nitinol metal stent platform which is designed to trap debris and emboli that can dislodge from the diseased carotid artery and potentially travel to the brain and cause a stroke. This danger is one of the greatest limitations of carotid artery stenting with conventional carotid stents and stenting methods. The CGuard EPS technology is a highly flexible stent system that conforms to the carotid anatomy.
 
We believe that our CGuard EPS design provides advantages over existing therapies in treating carotid artery stenosis, such as conventional carotid stenting and surgical endarterectomy, given the superior embolic protection characteristics provided by the MicroNet. We believe the MicroNet will provide acute embolic protection at the time of the procedure, but more importantly, we believe that CGuard EPS will provide post-procedure protection against embolic dislodgement, which can occur up to 48 hours post-procedure. It is in this post-procedure time frame that embolization is the source of post-procedural strokes in the brain. Schofer, et al. (“Late cerebral embolization after emboli-protected carotid artery stenting assessed by sequential diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging,” Journal of American College of Cardiology Cardiovascular Interventions, Volume 1, 2008) have shown that the majority of the incidents of embolic showers associated with carotid stenting occur post-procedure.
 
Our CGuard EPS original received CE mark approval in the EU in March 2013 and was fully launched in Europe in September 2015. Subsequently, we launched CGuard EPS in 30 plus countries and on February 3, 2021, we executed a distribution agreement with Chinese partners for the purpose of expanding our presence in China. On October 13, 2021, we announced that our CGuard EPS stent system received a positive opinion regarding reimbursement in France. Currently, we are seeking strategic partners for a potential launch of CGuard EPS in Japan and other Asian countries.
 
Our CE mark for CGuard EPS under the MDD expired on November 12, 2022 and we are in the final stages of technical documentation review by the Notified Body auditor to meet the MDR requirements for recertification. In the meantime, on February 14, 2023, we received a derogation per Article 97 paragraph 1 of Regulation 2017/745 from the Agency for Medicines and Health Products (FAMHP) allowing us to continue marketing CGuard EPS in the EU until August 15, 2023, subject to certain procedural requirements. Subsequently, on March 20, 2023, Regulation (EU) 2023/607 was published allowing us to continue marketing CGuard EPS in EU countries under the MDD directive until December 31, 2027. As a result of the foregoing, we may market and sell CGuard EPS in the EU and certain other jurisdictions subject to certain procedural requirements while our MDR CE recertification is pending. We continue to expedite the review process for recertification under the MDR.

On September 8, 2020, we received approval from the FDA of our IDE, thereby allowing us to proceed with a pivotal study of our CGuard™ Carotid Stent System, C-Guardians, for prevention of stroke in patients in the United States. C-Guardians is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, pivotal study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the CGuard™ Carotid Stent System when used to treat symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in patients undergoing carotid artery stenting. The trial was designed to enroll approximately 315 subjects in a maximum of 40 study sites located in the United States and Europe. Study sites in Europe may contribute a maximum of approximately 50% of the total enrollees. The primary endpoint of the study will be the composite of incidence of death (all-cause mortality), all stroke, and myocardial infarction (DSMI) through 30-days post-index procedure, based on the clinical events committee (CEC) adjudication and ipsilateral stroke from 31-365 day follow-up, based on Clinical Events Committee (CEC) adjudication. The composite index will be compared to a performance goal based on the observed rate of the two components of the primary endpoint from previous pivotal stent trials which are considered industry standard. The performance goal will be considered met if the upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval calculated from the observed primary endpoint rate is < 11.6% and the p-value is less than 0.025.
 
On July 23, 2021, we announced the initiation of enrollment and successful completion of the first cases of our C-Guardian trial of CGuard EPS. Since then we have continue to enroll subjects in the trial at approximately 20 trial sites and expect to complete enrollment approximately at the end the second quarter of 2023.
 
CGuard Prime Delivery System
 
The CGuard Prime™ System is a mesh-covered self-expanding carotid stent that is loaded into a transfemoral rapid exchange (Rx) delivery system that we are developing and that is subject to regulatory approval.
 
The CGuard Prime Carotid Stent is a self-expanding nitinol stent covered with a MicroNet bio-stable sleeve woven from a single strand of 23 μm Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET). The MicroNet sleeve is designed to trap and seal thrombus and plaque against the vessel wall, providing continuous embolic prevention. The CGuard Prime Carotid Stent is available in diameters ranging from 6.0mm to 10mm and in lengths of 20, 30, 40 and 60mm. The CGuard Prime Delivery System is a rapid exchange (Rx), delivery system with a 6Fr profile that can accommodate all stent sizes from 6mm to 10mm. The CGuard Prime Rx Delivery Systems are available in two lengths: 80 cm and 135 cm.
 
CGuard Prime™ advances the first generation CGuard transfemoral delivery system with new handle design for deployment accuracy, new catheter design for more flexible navigation of tortuous anatomy especially in acute revascularize settings as well as two lengths, 135cm and 80cm for booth transfemoral and trans ,carotid access.
 
Switchguard
 
SwitchGuard is a Class IIa, non-invasive transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) device that we are developing and that is subject to regulatory approval that is composed of medical grade tubing with male Luer lock connectors at each end and an in-line 200-micron blood filter. The device is intended as an external arterial-venous (A-V) shunt, allowing arterial blood to flow into the venous system, while filtering particulate before returning blood to the patient on the venous side.
 
The SwitchGuard arterio-venous extension line with filter is intended for flow circuit and particle removal when connecting arterial and/or venous introducers during interventional procedures.
 
SwitchGuard is being developed to answer a need of flow reversal for cerebral protection in CAS since symptomatic distal embolization, caused by the release of material (thrombotic, necrotic, or atherosclerotic) from the site of the lesion during the intervention, is the most frequent and important complication of CAS. Reversing blood flow has been shown to reduce stroke risk during carotid artery procedures.
 
Physicians frequently use extension lines constructed from blood filter transfusion sets during interventional procedures for the purpose of A-V shunting.

NGuard EPS – Acute Stroke with Tandem Lesions
 
In approximately 20% of acute strokes, the carotid artery is included in the cerebral occlusion pathway. Currently there is no indicated use of CAS for these lesions during stroke treatment. We believe CGuard EPS is optimally suited for intervention in this acute setting by way for design (flexible / low metal structure) as well as MicroNet mesh offering embolic protection both during and post procedural implantation. Our goal is to develop CGuard EPS to mitigate strokes in this acute setting.
 
MGuard Prime
 
We historically developed and sold MGuard Prime embolic protection system (“MGuard Prime EPS”) which was marketed for use in patients with acute coronary syndromes, notably acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) and saphenous vein graft coronary interventions, or bypass surgery. Over the past years there has been a shift in industry preferences away from bare-metal stents, such as MGuard Prime and as a result of declining sales and practical market utilization of the MGuard Prime EPS, which we believe was largely driven by the predominant industry preferences favoring drug-eluting or drug-coated, stents, during the second quarter of 2022 we ceased sales of our MGuard Prime EPS following a phase out period.
 
Completed Clinical Trials for CGuard EPS
 
CARENET
 
The CARENET trial was the first multi-center study of CGuard EPS following the receipt of CE mark of this device in March 2013. The CARENET trial was designed to evaluate feasibility and safety of CGuard EPS in treatment of carotid lesions in consecutive patients suitable for coronary artery stenting (“CAS”) in a multi-operator, real-life setting. The acute, 30 day, magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”), ultrasound and six month clinical event results were presented at the LINC conference in Leipzig, Germany in February, 2015. In the third quarter of 2015, the results of the CGuard CARENET trial were published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. In November 2015, positive twelve month follow-up data from the CGuard CARENET trial was presented at the 42nd Annual Symposium on Vascular and Endovascular Issues, documenting the benefits of the CGuard MicroNet technology as well as the patency benefits (maintaining the artery open) of the internal and external carotid arteries at twelve months. In September 2022, the results of the CGuard CARENET trial five year follow up were published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Cardiovascular Interventions Vol. 15, No 18, 2022 September 26, 2022:1883-1891. There was no ipsilateral stroke or ipsilateral stroke-related death which occurred throughout the five years. In addition, no stent restenosis or external carotid artery occlusion occurred in CARENET by 5 years, indicating normal healing and uncompromised side-branch patency.
 
MACCE (myocardial infarction (“MI”), stroke or death) rate was 0.0% at 30 days. At six months, there was one death, which was not device or procedure-related but did result in a MACCE rate of 3.6% at six months. At twelve months there were two additional deaths, which were not device or procedure-related resulting in a MACCE rate of 10.7% at one year.
 

 | 30 days (n=30) | | | 6 months (n=28) | | 12 months (n=28) 
--------------------------+----------------+---------+---+------------------+---------+------------------
MACCE (MI, stroke, death) | | (0) 0.0 | % | | (1) 3.6 | % | (3) 10.7 | %

death | | (0) 0.0 | % | | (1) 3.6 | % | (3) 10.7 | %

 
CAS carries the risk of cerebral embolization during and following the procedure, leading to life-threatening complications, mainly cerebral ischemic events. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is a sensitive tool used to identify cerebral emboli during CAS by measuring “lesions” within the brain which are areas that are ischemic and do not receive oxygenated blood due to cerebral emboli. In the CARENET trial, 37.0% of patients treated with CGuard EPS had new ischemic lesions at 48 hours after the procedure, with an average volume of 0.039 cm3. Of these lesions, there was only one that remained at 30 days following the procedure and all others had resolved. Complete details appear in the following table. Where there is a second number shown below after a ± symbol, it indicates the potential error in the measurement.

The healing process of the tissue and in-stent restenosis can be measured by a non-invasive form of ultrasound called duplex ultrasound. This type of ultrasound measures the velocity of the blood that flows within the carotid arteries, which increases exponentially as the lumen of the internal carotid artery narrows and the percent stenosis increases. One of the measurements is called PSV (peak systolic volume) and is known to be highly correlated to the degree of in-stent restenosis; PSV values higher than 300 cm/sec are indicative of >70% stenosis, while PSV values lower than 104 cm/sec are indicative of <30% restenosis and healthy healing. In the CARENET trial, duplex ultrasound measurements done at 30 days, 6 months and 12 months following the stenting procedure all attest to healthy normal healing without restenosis concerns, as the PSV values were 60.96 cm/sec ± 22.31, 85.24 cm/sec ± 39.56, and 90.22 cm/sec ± 37.72 respectively. The internal carotid artery was patent in all patients (100%).
 
The conclusions of the CARENET trial were:
 

● | The CARENET trial demonstrated safety of the CGuard EPS stent, with a 30 day MACCE rate of 0%. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Incidence of new ipsilateral lesions (percent of patients with new lesions on the ipsilateral side (same side where the stent was employed)) at 48 hours was reduced by almost half compared to published data, and volume was reduced almost tenfold. 
● | All but one lesion had resolved completely by 30 days. 
● | Twelve month data showed no stroke or stroke-related deaths, and no cardiac adverse events. 
● | Five year data showed no ipsilateral stroke or ipsilateral stroke-related deaths, and no stent restenosis or external carotid artery occlusion occurred in CARENET by 5 years, indicating normal healing and uncompromised side-branch patency. 
● | CGuard EPS offers enhanced benefits for patients undergoing CAS with unprecedented safety. 

 
Physician-Sponsored Clinical Trials for CGuard—PARADIGM-101 and PARADIGM -500 Studies
 
PARADIGM-101 (Prospective evaluation of All-comer peRcutaneous cArotiD revascularization In symptomatic and increased-risk asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, using CGuard™ Mesh-covered embolic prevention stent system-101) was an investigator-led, single center study with the objective of evaluating feasibility and outcome of routine use of CGuard EPS in 101 consecutive unselected all-comer patients referred for carotid revascularization, initiated in 2015. In May 2016, the 30-day results were presented at the EuroPCR 2016 Late-Breaking Clinical Trial Session in Paris, and in the Journal of EuroIntervention. In Dec 2020, the 12 month results were presented in the Official Journal of the EuroPCR and the European Association of Percutaneous Coronary Interventions, EuroIntervention 2020;16:e950-e952. DOI: 10.4244/EIJ-D-19-01014) Key findings from the PARADIGM-101 study and the follow-up data are as follows.
 

● | CGuard EPS delivery success was 99.1%. The clinical evaluation also found no device foreshortening or elongation; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Angiographic diameter stenosis or vessel narrowing was reduced from 83±9% to only 6.7±5% (p<0.001); 
● | Periprocedural death/major stroke/ myocardial infarction (“MI”) rates were 0%; 
● | Between 30 days and 12 months, there were no strokes or stroke-related deaths. There were four non -device related deaths (heart failure exacerbation, urosepsis, pulmonary embolism and microcellular pulmonary cancer). 

 
The results of the PARADIGM-101 study demonstrated that CGuard EPS can safely be used in a high risk, all-comer population of patients with carotid artery stenosis and indicated that routine use of CGuard EPS may prevent cerebral events, such as strokes, by holding plaque against the vessel wall, preventing emboli from being released into the blood stream. The PARADIGM-101 study found that CGuard EPS is applicable in up to 90% of all-comer patients with carotid stenosis.

PARADIGM-101 was subsequently increased to include 500 consecutive patients with symptomatic or increased stroke risk asymptomatic atherosclerotic carotid stenosis patients. The new study is known as PARADIGM -500. In June 2022, the 1 year results were presented at the EuroPCR in Leipzig, Germany.
 
Key findings from the PARADIGM-500 study are as follows.
 

● | 30 Day Death/Stroke rate of 0.75%; 30 day death/stroke/myocardial infarction rate of 0.94%; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | 12 month freedom from ipsilateral stroke, in stent restenosis and target lesion revascularization rate of 99.6%. 

Clinical Results and Mechanical Properties of the Carotid CGUARD Double-Layered Embolic Prevention Stent Study
 
“Clinical Results and Mechanical Properties of the Carotid CGUARD Double-Layered Embolic Prevention Stent Study” was an investigator-led, prospective single-center study which evaluated CGuard EPS in 30 consecutive patients with internal carotid artery stenosis disease with the objective of reporting early clinical outcomes with a novel MicroNet covered stent for the internal carotid artery and the in vitro investigation of the device’s mechanical properties. In October 2016, the 30-day positive results were published online-ahead-of-print in the Journal of Endovascular Therapy.
 
Key findings from the study are as follows:
 

● | 100% success in implanting CGuard EPS without residual stenosis; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | No peri- or post-procedural complications; 
● | No deaths, major adverse events, minor or major strokes, or new neurologic symptoms during the six months following the procedure; 
● | Modified Rankin Scale improved for the symptomatic patients from 1.56 prior to the procedure to 0 afterwards; 
● | All vessels treated with CGuard EPS remained patent (open) at six months; and 
● | DW-MRI performed in 19 of 30 patients found no new ipsilateral lesions after 30 days and after six months compared with the baseline DW-MRI studies. 

 
Additionally, based on engineering evaluations, the study concluded that CGuard EPS provides a high radial force and strong support in stenotic lesions. The stent is easy to use and safe to implant because it does not foreshorten and its structure adapts well to changes in diameter and direction of tortuous vascular anatomies. The MicroNet mesh of CGuard did not cause any changes to specific mechanical parameters of the underlying stent.
 
Safety and Efficacy of the New Micromesh-Covered Stent CGuard in Patients Undergoing Cartoid Artery Stenting: Early Experience From a Single Center
 
“Safety and Efficacy of the New Micromesh-Covered Stent CGuard in Patients Undergoing Carotid Artery Stenting: Early Experience From a Single Center” was an investigator-led, single-center study which evaluated CGuard EPS in 82 consecutive patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety (technical success) and efficacy (clinical success) of the CGuard stent system – a new nitinol stent covered by a closed-cell polyethylene and terephthalate mesh designed to prevent embolic events. In 2017, the 30-day positive results were published online-ahead-of-print in the European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2017), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejvs.2017.09.015.

● | One case of acute stent thrombosis occurred within 4 hours of the procedure: 
● | One minor stroke was recorded within the peri-operative period following the acute stent thrombosis, mentioned above; 
● | No new adverse neurological events were recorded at the post-operative period. 
● | DW-MRI was performed to assess the occurrence of new ischaemic brain lesions from the target vessel following placement of the CGuard stent peri- (48-72 hours) and post-operatively (30 days) in 21 and 11 patients, respectively. Five of 21 patients (23.8%) had new ischaemic brain lesions peri-operatively (48-72 hours) on the ipsilateral side, for a total number of 30 lesions, with an average lesion volume of 0.039 +/- 0.025 cm3. Four patients (19.1%) had new ischaemic brain lesions on the contralateral side, for a total number of nine lesions, with an average lesion volume of 0.019 +/- 0.011 cm3 (range 0.016-0.034 cm3). At the postoperative period, spontaneous resolution was noted in all the lesions recorded in the peri-operative period in the 11 patients participating. Only one symptomatic patient had two new ischaemic brain lesions (1 ipsilateral and 1 contralateral). 

 
CGUARD Mesh-Covered Stent in Real World: The IRON-Guard Registry
 
“CGUARD Mesh-Covered Stent in Real World: The IRON-Guard Registry using CGuard EPS” was a physician initiated prospective multi-center registry that included 200 patients from 12 medical centers in Italy. The objective of the study was to report 30-day outcomes (including MACCE) in a prospective series of patients who were treated with CGuard EPS between April 2015 and June 2016. In January 2017, 30-day results were presented at the Leipzig Interventional Course (LINC) 2017 and published in the Journal of EuroIntervention in May 2017. The 12 month follow-up was published in the Journal of EuroIntevention in October 2018.
 
Key 30-day results presented were:
 

● | 100% success in implanting CGuard EPS; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | No MI, major stroke or death at 30 days; 
● | There were two transient ischemic attacks and five periprocedural minor strokes, including one thrombosis solved by surgery. 
● | Total elimination of post-procedural neurologic complications by 30 days; 
● | DW-MRI performed pre-procedure and between 24 and 72 hours post-procedure in 61 patients, indicated that 12 patients had new micro emboli (19%). 
● | At 12 months, there were no new major neurological adverse events, thrombosis or external carotid occlusion recorded; 
● | One myocardial infarction occurred at 12 months. 

Initial Clinical Study of the New CGuard EPS MicroNet Covered Carotid Stent: “One Size Fits All”
 
“Initial Clinical Study of the New CGuard EPS MicroNet Covered Carotid Stent: ‘One Size Fits All’” was an investigator-led, single-center study, which evaluated CGuard EPS in 30 consecutive patients with symptomatic stenosis of the internal carotid artery with the objective of evaluating the CGuard EPS MicroNet covered stent for its ability to adjust to different vessel diameters. The results of the study were published in the Journal of Endovascular Therapy in May 2019. The conclusion of the study as reported was that CGuard EPS has high conformability combined with an almost equivalent outward radial force at expansion diameters ranging from 5.5 to 9.0 mm. The first clinical results demonstrate the “One Size Fits All” stent can be implanted in internal carotid arteries with reference diameters within this range.

Preliminary Results from a Prospective Real-World Multicenter Clinical Practice of Carotid Artery Stenting Using the CGuard Embolic Prevention System: The IRONGUARD 2 Study
 
“Preliminary Results From a Prospective Real-World Multicenter Clinical Practice of Carotid Artery Stenting Using the CGuard Embolic Prevention System: The IRONGUARD 2 Study” is a physician initiated prospective multi-center registry enrolling 733 patients from 20 medical centers in Italy, from January 2017 to June 2019. The objective of the study is to evaluate periprocedural (24 hours), post-procedural (up to 30 days), and 12-month outcomes in a largest, prospective, multicenter series of patients submitted for protected carotid artery stenting with the CGuard Embolic Prevention System. The 24-hour, 30-day and 12-month preliminary results (data available on 726 patients out of the 733 treated) were presented at the Leipzig Interventional Course (LINC) in January 2021. The study’s preliminary results from the IRONGUAURD 2 study suggested in a real-world evaluation of carotid artery stenting, Cguard EPS can be safely used for treatment of extracranial carotid artery stenosis, allowing a low rate of post procedural adverse events by 12 months.
 
Key findings from the study are as follows:
 

● | 100% procedural success in implanting CGuard EPS; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | 1 death from hemorrhagic stroke (patient was admitted for immediate treatment of CAS due to stroke), 2 minor strokes, 6 TIAs and one nonfatal AMI at 24 hours; 
● | 1 minor stroke, 2 TIAs, three AMIs, no deaths and no stent thrombosis/occlusions between 24 hours and 30 days; and 
● | 1 minor stroke, 4 TIAs, 2 AMIs and 8 deaths (the 2 mentioned AMIs, 4 malignancies, 1 suicide and 1 undefined complication in Guillain-Barré Syndrome) between 30 days and 1 year. 

Thirty-Day Results of the Novel CGuard-Covered Stent in Patients Undergoing Carotid Artery Stenting
 
“Thirty-Day Results of the Novel CGuard-Covered Stent in Patients Undergoing Carotid Artery Stenting” was an investigator-led, prospective single-center study which evaluated CGuard EPS in 103 patients that underwent carotid artery stenting procedures.

The SIBERIA Trial for Carotid Artery Stenosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Conventional Versus Micronet™-Covered Stent Use in Percutaneous Neuroprotected Carotid Artery Revascularization: Peri-procedural and 30-day Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Clinical Outcomes (RCT trial)
 
“The SIBERIA Trial for Carotid Artery Stenosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Conventional Versus Micronet™-Covered Stent Use in Percutaneous Neuroprotected Carotid Artery Revascularization: Peri-procedural and 30-day Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Clinical Outcomes” was an investigator-initiated randomized clinical trial, single-center study, which evaluated one hundred patients who qualified for carotid revascularization with high risk for surgery and were randomized 1:1 to either CGuard EPS or AcculinkTM. The primary endpoints were incidence and volume of new cerebral embolic post-procedural lesions (24-48 hours) as determined by diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI). The principal secondary endpoints included incidence of periprocedural or postprocedural stroke, myocardial infarction and death at 30 days. The 30 day results of the study were presented in a late-breaking session at the EuroPCR in June 2020 and published (Randomized Controlled Trial of Conventional Versus MicroNet-Covered Stent in Carotid Artery Revascularization, JACC Cardiovascular Interventions, Vol. 14, November 21, 2021). The conclusion of the study was that the CGuard™ Micronet™-covered stent use in consecutive unselected patients subjected to neuroprotected carotid artery stenting was associated with a greater than three-fold reduction in the procedure-generated mean cerebral lesion volume, and with zero post-procedural cerebral embolisms observed. The MicroNet covered stent significantly reduced periprocedural and abolished post procedural cerebral embolism in relation to a conventional carotid stent. This is consistent with the MicroNet covered stent’s sustained embolism prevention, translating into cerebral protection not only during but after carotid artery stenting. The incidence of restenosis and vessel occlusion according to the ICA (internal carotid artery) ultrasound and the incidence of strokes, myocardial infarctions or deaths between the study arms at 365 days were presented at the LINC conference in Leipzig, Germany in June , 2022. The 12 month outcomes demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of the combined endpoint of death, stroke or myocardial infarctions and in-stent restenosis and vessel occlusion rate in the first generation (single layer) carotid stent, AcculinkTM, versus the MicroNet-Covered Stent, CGuard™.
 
Key findings from the study are as follows:
 

● | Peri Procedure, the CGuard™ arm was observed to have a 57% reduction in new cerebral lesion average volume per patient (171 mm3 vs. 73 mm3), a statistically significant improvement (p=0.017) and 222 mm3 vs. 84 mm3 (p=0.038); 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Post Procedure (24-48 hours), the CGuard™ arm was observed to have a 78% reduction in the average volume of new cerebral lesions (157 mm3 vs. 700 mm3), a statistically significant improvement (p=0.007); 
● | At 30 days, DW-MRI showed zero new cerebral lessons in the CGuard™ arm versus six in the Acculink™ arm (p=0.03); 
● | At 30 days, there were zero strokes, myocardial infarctions or deaths in the CGuard arm and two events the Acculink™ arm (two strokes); 


● | At 365 there were zero cases of restenosis and vessel occlusion in the CGuard™ arm versus 3 cases of restenosis and 1 case of vessel occlusion in the Acculink™ arm; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | At 365 days, there were one event in the CGuard arm (one death) and five events the Acculink™ arm (two strokes, two deaths and one myocardial infarction). 

Future Clinical Trials 
 
Pre and post-marketing clinical trials (outside the United States) could be conducted to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CGuard EPS in specific indications and new products, such as SwitchGuard. These trials would be designed to facilitate market acceptance and expand the use of the product.

Growth Strategy
 
Our primary business objective is to utilize our proprietary MicroNet technology and products to become the industry standard for treatment of stroke and complex vascular disease and to provide a superior solution to the common acute problems caused by current stenting procedures, such as restenosis, embolic showers and late thrombosis. We are pursuing the following business strategies to achieve this objective.

● | Widen the adoption of CGuard EPS. We are seeking to expand the population of CGuard EPS patients in those countries in which CGuard EPS is commercially available. In particular, our focus is on establishing CGuard EPS as a viable alternative (in appropriate cases) to conventional carotid stents and vascular surgery within the applicable medical communities. We intend to accomplish this goal by continuing to publish and present our clinical data, support investigator-initiated clinical registries and exploring addition of a procedural protection device to our portfolio incorporating the principal of reverse flow of the carotid artery as an adjunctive alternative to femoral access. We have partnered and will continue to seek out partnerships with organizations focused on the treatment of stroke. We will also continue to engage advisory boards and to develop a network of key opinion leaders to assist us in our efforts to widen the adoption of CGuard EPS. We aim to be the only company focusing on the broadest category of sub specialists treating Carotid Artery Disease, both surgeons and interventional sub specialists and the only company offering both a TCAR and TFEM delivery option. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Portfolio expansion and pipeline development We plan to continue to invest in advancing our portfolio with new delivery system alternatives to facilitate the use of CGuard by all physicians. We believe our delivery systems, if approved, will enable all endovascular access points including accessory devices for trans carotid artery revascularization. 
● | Grow our presence in existing and new markets for CGuard EPS. We have launched CGuard EPS in most European and Latin American countries through a comprehensive distributor sales organizations network. We are continuing to focus on larger growing markets through this network by supporting our distributors with a comprehensive marketing and clinical education programs. In additional we have begun to sell direct to hospitals in certain markets and continue to evaluate the transition to a direct selling to hospitals model in certain currently served distributor markets, increasing our control on the market and gross profit margins. We are pursuing additional product registrations and distribution contracts with local distributors in other countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America. In February 2021, we executed a distribution agreement with Chinese partners for the purpose of expanding our presence in China. Currently, we are seeking strategic partners for a potential launch of CGuard EPS in Japan and other Asian countries. In addition, we are conducting a pivotal study of our CGuard™ Carotid Stent System, C-Guardians, for prevention of stroke in patients in the United States. 


● | CMS approval of National Coverage Determination – During January 2023, CMS approved the first step of reimbursement of a national Coverage Decision for standard risk stent intervention of carotid disease. This decision has the potential to profoundly increase the available market to endovascular procedures as payment is pending for approval for a much boarder definition of surgical risk. Currently, only high-risk patients to surgery are paid through the CMS coverage, NCA - Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) of the Carotid Artery Concurrent with Stenting (CAG-00085R8) - Tracking Sheet (cms.gov) 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to leverage our MicroNet technology to develop additional applications for interventional cardiologists and vascular surgeons. In addition to the applications described above, we believe that we will eventually be able to utilize our proprietary MicroNet technology to address imminent market needs for new product innovations to significantly improve patients’ care. We continue to broadly develop and protect intellectual property using our mesh technology. Examples of some areas include peripheral vascular disease and neurovascular disease. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Establish relationships with collaborative and development partners to fully develop and market our existing and future products. We are seeking strategic partners for collaborative research, development, marketing, distribution, or other agreements, which could assist with our development and commercialization efforts for CGuard EPS and other potential products that are based on our MicroNet technology. 

Competition
 
The markets in which we compete are highly competitive, subject to change and impacted by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants.
 

-14-
----

Carotid
 
With respect to competition for our carotid embolic prevention system, CGuard EPS™, the manufacturers of products used in connection with CAS procedures in the United States, is comprised of a number of large companies, including Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific Corporation, Covidien Ltd. (currently part of Medtronic, Inc.) and Cordis Corporation. In Europe, in addition to the above mentioned manufacturers, Terumo Medical Corporation is also a market participant that has a share of the market for products used in connection with CAS procedures. As we develop and seek regulatory approval in the United States and Europe for our new TCAR delivery system, SwitchGuard™, and continue to seek greater market share for CGuard EPS™, we expect to compete with Silk Road Medical in the total carotid artery revascularization market that comprises both CAS and carotid endarterectomy (“CEA”).
 
Many of these companies are larger companies or divisions of publicly-traded companies that have certain competitive advantages, including greater capital resources, larger customer bases, broader product lines, larger sales forces, greater marketing and management resources, larger research and development staffs and larger facilities than ours and have established reputations, relationships with our target customers and worldwide distribution methods that are more effective than ours. However, while there are currently many market participants in the U.S. carotid stent market, we believe that the European market is somewhat more fragmented for CEA and CAS products, and, in our opinion, smaller competitors may be able to gain market share with greater flexibility and more efficiently than in the United States.
 
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
 

● | Patient outcomes and adverse event rates; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Patient experience; 
● | Acceptance by treating physicians and referral sources; 
● | Physician learning curve; 
● | Ease-of-use and reliability; 
● | Patient recovery time and level of discomfort; 
● | Economic benefits and cost savings; 
● | Availability of reimbursement; and 
● | Strength of clinical evidence. 

Sales and Marketing
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Based on the positive CGuard EPS clinical data, we initiated the commercial launch of CGuard EPS in CE marked countries in early 2015. In September 2015, we announced full market launch of CGuard EPS in Europe. Since 2017 we are focusing on sales of our products through local distribution partners and our own internal sales initiatives to gain greater reach into all the relevant clinical specialties and to expand our geographic coverage. Our current strategy seeks to broaden our sales efforts to increase CGuard EPS penetration within the community of interventionalists. In parallel, we aim at transitioning vascular surgeons from carotid endarterectomy procedures to carotid stenting with CGuard EPS and accessory devices, which we believe can greatly expand our customer base. We have focused and we plan to continue to focus our marketing efforts primarily on key growth markets and to evaluate opportunities in new territories if and when they become available. In addition, we are using international trade shows and industry conferences to gain market exposure and brand recognition. We continue to work with leading physicians to enhance our marketing effort and are developing relationships with new key opinion leaders to champion our technology and work with us in clinical studies. In additional we have begun to sell direct to hospitals in certain markets, such as France and the United Kingdom, in order to increase our growth in the market and gross profit margins.

Product Positioning
 
When treating carotid artery disease, we believe that CGuard has potential to become the standard of care in treading carotid artery disease. It is a second-generation stent with positive patient outcomes demonstrating significant reduction in post-procedural neurological events.
 
Additionally, we intend to continue to evaluate potential product enhancements and manufacturing enhancements for CGuard EPS expected to reduce cost of goods or provide the best-in-class performing delivery system and accessory solutions. We believe these improvements may allow us to reduce cost of goods and increase penetration in our existing geographies and better position us for entry into new markets. Finally, we do not expect that it would be crucial to use a drug-eluting stent platform to compete in certain new markets such as the neurovascular market, and hence, we plan to continue to explore this area of opportunity.
 
Insurance Reimbursement
 
In most countries, a significant portion of a patient’s medical expenses is covered by third-party payors. Third-party payors can include both government-funded insurance programs and private insurance programs. While each payor develops and maintains its own coverage and reimbursement policies, payors, in many instances, have similarly established policies, and in the U.S., for example, coverage policies and reimbursement rates of private payors are often influenced by those established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The CGuard product sold to-date in applicable foreign countries have been designed and labeled to facilitate the utilization of existing reimbursement codes for such countries, and we intend to continue to design and label our present and future products in a manner consistent with this goal.
 
While most countries have established reimbursement codes for stenting procedures, certain countries may require additional clinical data before recognizing coverage and/or to obtain a certain level of reimbursement for one or more of our products. In these situations, we intend to complete the required clinical studies to obtain reimbursement approval in countries where it makes economic sense to do so.

Intellectual Property
 
Patents
 
We have 58 issued patents, including 16 patents issued in the U.S., and 17 pending patent applications, 6 of which are pending in the United States. Many of these patents and applications cover aspects of our CGuard and MGuard technology. Patents outside the U.S. have been filed in Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, Australia, and South Africa. The patents and applications fall into a number of patent families, as listed below:

The patents and patent applications listed above cover various aspects of our products, specifically focusing on the mesh sleeve covering our stents, as well as methods for production and delivery mechanisms of the stents. We believe that our patents, in particular those covering the use of a knitted micron-level mesh sleeve over a stent for various indications, as well as our pending patent applications (if issued as patents with claims substantially in their present form), create a significant barrier against other companies seeking to use similar technology. We believe these patents and patent applications collectively cover all our existing products and may be useful in protecting our future technological developments. We intend to aggressively continue patenting new technologies and to actively pursue any infringement of our key patents.
 
Trade Secrets
 
We also rely on trade secret protection to protect our interests in proprietary know-how and/or for processes for which patents are difficult to obtain or enforce. As part of our trade secret policy, we rely on non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect trade secrets and other proprietary technology.

The trademarks are renewable indefinitely, so long as we continue using the marks and make the appropriate filings when required. We also use and may have common-law rights to various trademarks, trade names, and service marks.
 
Government Regulation
 
The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally the European Union CE mark and other corresponding foreign agencies.
 
Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. These laws and regulations range from simple product registration requirements in some countries to complex approval process, clinical trials and production controls in others. As a result, the processes and time periods required to obtain foreign marketing approval may be longer or shorter than those necessary to obtain FDA market authorization. These differences may affect the timeliness of international market introduction of our products. For the European Union nations, medical devices must obtain a CE mark before they may be placed on the market. In order to obtain and maintain the CE mark, we must comply with EU law on medical devices, which, until May 26, 2021 was governed by the MDD, by presenting comprehensive technical files for our products demonstrating safety and efficacy of the product to be placed on the market and passing initial and annual quality management system audit as per ISO 13485 standard by a European Notified Body. We have obtained ISO 13485 quality system certification and CGuard EPS that we currently distribute into the European Union, displays the required CE mark. In order to maintain certification, we are required to pass an annual surveillance audit conducted by Notified Body auditors. The European Union replaced the MDD with the new MDR regulation. The MDR entered into force after a transitional period of three years and a one year extension of that transition period due to the COVID-19 pandemic on May 26, 2021 and which changes several aspects of the regulatory framework in the European Union. Manufacturers had the duration of the transition period to update their technical documentation and processes to meet the new requirements in order to obtain a CE Mark.
 
In our specific case, our CE mark for CGuard EPS under the MDD expired on November 12, 2022, and we are in the final stages of technical documentation review by the Notified Body auditor to meet the MDR requirements for recertification. In the meantime, on February 14, 2023, we received a derogation per Article 97 paragraph 1 of Regulation 2017/745 from the Agency for Medicines and Health Products (FAMHP) allowing us to continue marketing CGuard EPS in the EU until August 15, 2023, subject to certain procedural requirements. Subsequently, on March 20, 2023, Regulation (EU) 2023/607 was published allowing us to continue marketing CGuard EPS in EU countries under the MDD directive until December 31, 2027. As a result of the foregoing, we may market and sell CGuard EPS in the EU and certain other jurisdictions subject to certain procedural requirements while our MDR CE recertification is pending. We continue to expedite the review process for recertification under the MDR.

We have or had regulatory approval and made sales of CGuard EPS either through distributors pursuant to distribution agreements or directly, in the countries listed in the table below. While each of the European Union member countries accepts the CE mark as its sole requirement for marketing approval, some of these countries still require us to take additional steps in order to gain reimbursement rights for our products. Furthermore, while we believe that certain of the below-listed countries that are not members of the European Union and accept the CE mark as a primary requirement for marketing approval, each such country requires additional regulatory requirements for final marketing approval of our products. Furthermore, we are currently targeting additional countries in Europe, Asia, and Latin America; however, even if all governmental regulatory requirements are satisfied in each such country, we anticipate that obtaining marketing approval in each country could take as few as three months or as many as twelve months or more, due to the nature of the approval process in each individual country, including typical wait times for application processing and review, as discussed in greater detail below.

FDA Government Regulation of Medical Devices for Human Subjects
 
Many of our activities are subject to regulatory oversight by the FDA under provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and regulations thereunder, including regulations governing the development, marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing, and export of medical devices.
 
FDA Approval/Clearance Requirements
 
In the United States, most Class II or III medical devices must be cleared or approved by the FDA prior to commercialization. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we market or wish to market in the United States must receive 510(k) clearance or premarket approval. Medical devices that are class II devices receive 510(k) clearance are “cleared” by the FDA to market, distribute, and sell in the United States. Medical devices that are class III devices obtain a premarket approval by the FDA are “approved” to market, distribute, and sell in the United States. We anticipate filing a premarket approval application, or PMA, in the future for our product and do not anticipate filing a 510(k) premarket notification, provided that the FDA will not instruct us otherwise. We cannot guarantee that we will obtain premarket approval, which will likely include clinical testing. Descriptions of the premarket approval and 510(k) clearance processes are provided below.
 
Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s general regulatory controls for medical devices, or the General Controls, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s quality system regulations, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) process described below.
 
Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) process. Pursuant to the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUFMA), as of October 2002, unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) submissions are subject to user fees. Certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process. The FDA has recently indicated that it intends to modernize the 510(k) process and has issued new guidance documents that may change the way that devices are cleared by the FDA.

Class III includes devices with the greatest risk. Devices in this class must meet all of the requirements in Classes I and II. In addition, Class III devices cannot generally be marketed until they receive a premarket approval. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by the General Controls and the other requirements described above. These devices require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Under MDFUMA, PMAs (and supplemental PMAs) are subject to significantly higher user fees than 510(k) applications, and they also require considerably more time and resources.
 
The FDA decides whether a device line must undergo either the 510(k) clearance or premarket approval based on statutory criteria that utilize a risk-based classification system. Premarket approval is the FDA process of scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices and, in many cases, Class II medical devices. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. The FDA uses these criteria to decide whether a premarket approval or a 510(k) is appropriate, including the level of risk that the agency perceives is associated with the device and a determination by the agency of whether the product is a type of device that is similar to devices that are already legally marketed. Devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either Class I or II. In many cases, the FDA requires the manufacturer to submit a 510(k) requesting clearance (also referred to as a premarket notification), unless an exemption applies. The 510(k) must demonstrate that the manufacturer’s proposed device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a legally marketed predicate device. A “predicate device” is a pre-existing medical device to which equivalence can be drawn, that is either in Class I, Class II, or is a Class III device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of a PMA. A product that lacks a predicate device will default to a Class III device, although a company may seek to submit a De Novo classification request, rather than a PMA. The De Novo request allows a regulatory pathway to classify novel medical devices for which general controls alone, or general and special controls, provide reasonable occurrence of safety and effectiveness for the intended use, but for which there is no legally marketed predicate device.
 
We expect that unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we market or wish to market in the United States must receive 510(k) clearance or premarket approval. Medical devices that receive 510(k) clearance are “cleared” by the FDA to market, distribute, and sell in the United States. Medical devices that obtain a premarket approval by the FDA are “approved” to market, distribute, and sell in the United States. We anticipate that each device that we wish to commercialize will be considered a Class III device by the FDA and therefore we anticipate filing a PMA in the future and do not anticipate filing a 510(k) premarket notification, provided that the FDA will not instruct us otherwise. We cannot guaranty that we will obtain a premarket approval. Descriptions of the premarket approval and 510(k) clearance processes are provided below.
 
Premarket Approval Pathway
 
We expect that current and future applications of our technology will result in medical devices that are considered Class III devices subject to premarket approval. A PMA must be submitted if a device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process, unless FDA permits a De Novo application. A PMA must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, analytical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing, statutory preapproval inspections, and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. Before a premarket approval application is submitted, a manufacturer must apply for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to conduct clinical trials. If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, to human health, the FDA requires the device sponsor to file an IDE application with the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to initiation of enrollment of human subjects for clinical trials. The IDE provides the manufacturer with a legal pathway to perform clinical trials on human subjects where without the IDE, only approved medical devices may be used on human subjects.
 
The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as analytical, animal and laboratory testing results, manufacturing information, and an Investigational Review Board (IRB) approved protocol showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound, as well as ensuring patient informed consent is obtained. If the clinical trial design is deemed to have “non-significant risk,” the clinical trial may be eligible for “abbreviated” IDE requirements.
 
A clinical trial may be suspended by either the FDA or the IRB at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the study. Even if a study is completed, clinical testing results may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device, or they may be equivocal or otherwise insufficient to obtain approval of the product being tested. After the clinical trials have been completed, if at all, and the clinical trial data and results are collected and organized, a manufacturer may complete a premarket approval application.

----


After a PMA is sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application and begin an in-depth review of the submitted information. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the “accepted application,” although, generally, review of the application can take between one and three years, but it may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The preapproval inspections conducted by the FDA include an evaluation of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the Quality Systems Regulations, as well as inspections of the clinical trial sites by the Bioresearch Monitoring group to evaluate compliance with good clinical practice and human subject protections. New premarket approval applications or premarket approval supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. Significant changes to an approved premarket approval require a 180-day supplement, whereas less substantive changes may utilize a 30-day notice, or a 135-day supplement. Premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application, and it may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
 
510(k) Clearance Pathway
 
We do not currently market, distribute, or sell any products that have market clearance by the FDA under its 510(k) process. If, in the future, we develop products where 510(k) clearance is required, we would be required to submit a 510(k) demonstrating that such proposed devices are substantially equivalent to a respective previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of 510(k). The FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to twelve months but could take longer. In some cases, the FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.
 
If a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, a premarket approval. The FDA requires each device manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a new 510(k) or a premarket approval, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of the modified device is obtained.
 
Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation
 
A host of regulatory requirements apply to our approved devices, including the quality system regulation (which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures), the Medical Device Reporting regulations (which require that manufacturers report to the FDA specified types of adverse events involving their products), labeling regulations, and the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses. Class II devices also can have special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, and certain FDA guidelines do apply to Class I devices.
 
A noncomprehensive list of the regulatory requirements that apply to our approved products classified as medical devices include:
 

● | product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Quality Systems Regulations, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the development and manufacturing process; 


-22-
----


● | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices (if obtained); 
● | approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our cleared devices (if obtained); 
● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur; 
● | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; 
● | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; 
● | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; 
● | regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and, 
● | notices of corrections or removals. 

 
We do not currently have a registered establishment with the FDA. If we are approved or cleared to manufacture, prepare, or process a device in the United States, we and any third-party manufacturers that we may use will be required to register our establishments with the FDA. As such, we and our manufacturing facilities will be subject to FDA inspections for compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation. Additionally, some of our subcontractors may also be subject to FDA announced and unannounced inspections for compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation. These regulations will require that we manufacture our products and maintain our documents in a prescribed manner with respect to design, manufacturing, testing and quality control activities. As a medical device manufacturer, we will further be required to comply with FDA requirements regarding the reporting of adverse events associated with the use of our medical devices, as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. FDA regulations also govern product labeling and prohibit a manufacturer from marketing a medical device for unapproved applications.
 
Our CGuard EPS is classified as a Class III medical device by the FDA. Class III medical devices are generally the highest risk devices and are therefore subject to the highest level of regulatory control by the FDA, since the FDA process of premarket approval involves scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices for the purpose(s) intended. The FDA will either approve or deny a premarket approval application and we cannot market a device unless or until the FDA approves a premarket approval application.
 
We expect the approval process in the U.S. to take a significant amount of time, require the expenditure of significant resources, involve rigorous clinical investigations and testing, and potentially require changes to products. The approval process may result in limitations on the indicated uses of the medical devices for which we are able to obtain approval (since the FDA can take action against a company that promotes off-label uses) and will also require increased post-market surveillance.

U.S. Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 
In addition to the FDA regulations, there are a variety of other healthcare laws and regulations to which we may be subject if any of our products are marketed, sold, distributed, and/or utilized in the United States. In the United States, we may be subject to the oversight of FDA, Office of the Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG), the Center for Medicare/Medicaid Services (CMS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), in addition to others. We supply products that may be reimbursed by federally funded programs such as Medicare. As a result, our activities may be subject to regulation by CMS and enforcement by OIG and DOJ. Of specific note are federal and state fraud and abuse laws, which prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration, including the offer or solicitation of such payment, intended to induce or reward the purchase, recommendation or generation of business involving healthcare products any item or service payable by a health-care program. Other provisions of federal and state laws prohibit presenting, or causing to be presented, to third party payors (including, government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid) for reimbursement, claims that are false or fraudulent, or which are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. In addition, other healthcare laws and regulations may apply, such as transparency and reporting requirements, and privacy and security requirements. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. These laws are potentially applicable to manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA as medical devices, such as us, and hospitals, physicians and other institutional or individual providers that may refer or purchase such products. The healthcare laws that may be applicable to our business or operations include, but are not limited to:
 

● | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits a person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for or to induce referring or recommending an individual to another person to receive items or services or to purchase, lease, order, or arrange for any good, facility, item or service payable in whole or in part under a Federal health care program; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other government healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program, knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or knowingly makes a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which includes provisions that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, and for knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 
● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations and requirements on healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform certain services for them that involve the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, with respect to safeguarding the privacy and security of certain individually identifiable health information; 
● | The federal transparency requirements under the Affordable Care Act, including the provision commonly referred to as the Open Payments Act or Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and 
● | Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to referrals and items or services reimbursed by both governmental and non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal law, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Customers
 
Our customer base is varied. We currently have distribution agreements for our CE mark-approved CGuard EPS with medical product distributors based in Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific and Latin America. We are currently in discussions with additional distribution companies in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
 
Most of our current agreements with our distributors stipulate that, and we expect our future agreements with our distributors to stipulate that, while we shall assist in training by providing training materials, marketing guidance, marketing materials, and technical guidance, each distributor will be responsible for carrying out local registration, sales and marketing activities. In addition, in most cases, all sales costs, including sales representatives, incentive programs, and marketing trials, will be borne by the distributor. Under current agreements, distributors purchase stents from us at a fixed price. Our current agreements with distributors are generally for a term of two to three years.
 
On February 3, 2021, we entered into a Distribution Agreement with three China-based partners, pursuant to which the Chinese partners will be responsible for conducting the necessary registration trials for commercial approval of our products in China, followed by an exclusive distribution right to sell our products in China. Under the Distribution Agreement, the China-based partners will be subject to minimum purchase obligations.
 
We have also engaged in direct sales in certain geographic markets such as United Kingdom and France.
 
Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
The polymer fiber for MicroNet is supplied by Biogeneral, Inc., a San Diego, California-based specialty polymer manufacturer for medical and engineering applications.
 
Our catheter supplier for CGuard EPS supplies us with catheters that help create the base for our CGuard EPS stents. Our agreement with with the supplier may be terminated by us upon eight months’ notice. On September 17, 2019, we amended the agreement with the supplier so that we are responsible for purchasing and handling inventory of CGuard EPS delivery system, and they are responsible for the manufacturing process.
 
Our catheter supplier for CGuard Prime supplies us with catheters that help create the base for our CGuard Prime. Our agreement with the supplier which may be terminated by us upon 9 months’ notice, calls for non-binding minimum orders.
 
We manufacture our CGuard EPS and our CGuard Prime at our own facility. The self-expanding bare-metal stents for our CGuard EPS and our CGuard Prime are being manufactured and supplied by a supplier. Our agreement with the supplier for the production of electro polished L605 bare-metal stents for CGuard EPS and CGuard Prime is priced on a per-stent basis, subject to the quantity of stents ordered. The complete assembly process for CGuard EPS and CGuard Prime, including knitting and securing the sleeve to the stent and the crimping of the sleeve stent on to a delivery catheter, is done at our Israel manufacturing site. Once CGuard EPS and CGuard Prime have been assembled, they are sent for sterilization in a third-party facility in Israel, and then back to our facility for final packaging and distribution.
 
A CGuard EPS and CGuard Prime consists of a CGuard stent and the delivery system. Each CGuard stent is manufactured from two main components, a self-expending nickel-titanium stent and the mesh polymer. This material is readily available and we acquire it in the open market. The mesh is made from polyethylene terephthalate (polyester). We have patent rights that cover the proposed CGuard stent with mesh. During the last year our mesh supplier informed us that it will not be able to supply the polymer fiber in the future due to issues with raw materials, therefore we purchased inventory which should be sufficient to support our production needs in the next 2.5 years. We are currently in the process of finding and qualifying another supplier or other material source which could take up to a year. The delivery system for CGuard is made out of polymer tubes we acquire from an original equipment manufacturer. In the event that our supplier can no longer supply this material, we would need to qualify another supplier, which could take up to a year. In addition, in order to retain the approval of the CE mark, we are required to perform periodic audits of the quality control systems of our key suppliers in order to ensure that their products meet our predetermined specifications.

Properties
 
Our headquarters are located in Tel Aviv, Israel, where we lease a 1,250 square meter office and manufacturing facility that has the capacity to manufacture and assemble 1,750 stents per month, based upon the production schedule of one shift per day. We believe that our current facility is sufficient to meet anticipated future demand by adding additional shifts to our current production schedule.
Human Capital Management
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 56 employees, 55 full-time and 1 part-time, consisting of 2 in executive management, 6 in research and development, 8 in quality assurance and compliance, 5 in finance and accounting, 21 in operations/production, 12 in sales, marketing and clinical, and 2 in all other miscellaneous roles, Human resources, and administration. Except for 5 of our employees in Europe, our employees are not party to any collective bargaining agreements. We do not expect the collective bargaining agreements to which our employees are party to have a material effect on our business or results of operations. We also employ 3 independent contractors in Poland and 1 in Brazil.
 
We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. In particular, we depend on the skills, experience and performance of our senior management and research personnel. We compete for qualified personnel with other medical device, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and healthcare companies, as well as universities and non-profit research institutions.
 
We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region and employment classification) include incentive compensation plan, pension, healthcare and insurance benefits, paid time off, family leave, and on-site services, among others. We also use targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly for our key employees.
 
We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
