We are a cellular analysis company that is discovering new cancer sub-types and commercializing diagnostic tests designed to significantly improve the clinical outcomes of cancer patients treated with targeted therapies. Our proprietary CELx diagnostic platform is the only commercially ready technology we are aware of that uses a patient’s living tumor cells to identify the specific abnormal cellular process driving a patient’s cancer and the targeted therapy that best treats it. We believe our CELx platform provides two important improvements over traditional molecular diagnostics. First, molecular diagnostics can only provide a snapshot of the genetic mutations present in a patient’s tumor because they analyze dead cells. Using dead cells prevents molecular diagnostics from analyzing in real-time the dynamic cellular activities, known as cell signaling, that regulate cell proliferation or survival. Cancer can develop when certain cell signaling activity becomes abnormal. Since genetic mutations are often only weakly correlated to the cell signaling activity driving a patient’s cancer, a molecular diagnostic is prone to providing an incomplete diagnosis. CELx tests overcome this limitation by measuring real-time cell signaling activity in a patient’s living tumor cells. When a CELx test detects abnormal signaling activity, a more accurate diagnosis of the patient’s cancer driver is obtained. Second, molecular diagnostics can only estimate the probability of a patient’s potential drug response based on a statistical analysis of the drug’s clinical trial results. Instead of this indirect estimate of drug response, CELx tests confirm that a targeted therapeutic matches the patient’s cancer driver, which significantly increases the likelihood of a positive clinical outcome.
 
Our first analytically validated and commercially ready test using our CELx platform is our CELx HER2 Signaling Function Test, or CELx HSF Test. Our CELx HSF Test diagnoses two new sub-types of HER2-negative breast cancer that traditional molecular diagnostics cannot detect. Our internal studies show that approximately 15%-20% of HER2-negative breast cancer patients have abnormal HER2 signaling activity similar to levels found in HER2+ breast cancer cells. As a result, these HER2-negative patients have undiagnosed HER2-driven breast cancer and would be likely to respond to the same anti-HER2 targeted therapies only HER2+ patients receive today. Our CELx HSF Test is targeting HER2-negative breast cancer patients receiving drug treatment.
 
We completed development of our second CELx test for breast cancer during the first quarter of 2018. This new test evaluates independent c-Met signaling activity and its involvement with HER family signaling in HER2-negative breast cancer tumor cells. Our internal studies have found that approximately 20%-25% of HER2-negative breast cancer patients have abnormal c-Met signaling activity that is co-activated with abnormal HER family signaling. These studies suggest that this sub-group of HER2-negative breast cancer patients may best respond to treatment with a combination of HER family and c-Met inhibitors. We intend to combine this c-Met signaling function test with our current HER2 signaling function test to create the CELx Multi-Pathway Signaling Function (MP) Test, or CELx MP Test. With this next generation CELx test, we plan to provide an analysis of HER1, HER2, HER3, and c-MET signaling activity with a single patient tumor specimen.
 
In addition to the two new breast cancer sub-types our CELx MP Test diagnoses, we discovered 12 new potential cancer sub-types in breast, lung, colon, ovarian, kidney, and bladder cancers. Approved or investigational drugs are currently available to treat each of these new potential cancer sub-types. CELx tests for these additional cancer sub-types are in various stages of development, and we expect them to become commercially ready on a staggered basis over the next few years. The development process for these additional CELx tests includes completion of internal animal, verification, training set, and validation studies. As new CELx tests become commercially ready, we expect to initiate collaborations with pharmaceutical companies to help them obtain new drug indications for the new cancer sub-types our tests identify. In addition, we will continue our research to identify additional new cancer sub-types and to develop the corresponding CELx tests to diagnose them.
 
Our overall commercialization strategy is to develop diagnostics that identify new cancer sub-types and to seek collaborations with pharmaceutical companies, which can vary in scope. We have two collaborations underway that rely on the CELx HSF Test to select breast cancer patients for treatment with HER2 targeted therapies. For the first one of these collaborations, we are fielding a prospective clinical trial with Genentech and the NSABP to evaluate the efficacy of Genentech’s HER2 targeted therapies in patients with these newly identified cancer sub-types. We expect interim results from this trial in late 2019 and final results approximately nine months later. For the second of these collaborations, we are fielding a prospective clinical trial with Puma Biotechnology, Inc. and West Cancer Center to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Puma’s drug, Nerlynx, and chemotherapy, in breast cancer patients selected with Celcuity’s CELx HSF Test. We expect the trial to be activated in early 2019 and to obtain interim results in late 2019 or early 2020 and final results approximately 12 months later.

For a third collaboration, Celcuity was selected by NSABP and Puma Biotechnology, Inc. to evaluate tissue samples from a Phase II study evaluating Puma Biotechnology’s pan-HER inhibitor, Nerlynx, Genentech’s HER2 antibody, Herceptin, and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s EGFR inhibitor, Erbitux, in metastatic colorectal cancer patients. This 35-patient study is expected to be completed in late 2020. Unlike the trial with NSABP and Genentech, Celcuity’s test will be used solely to evaluate tissue samples after they have been enrolled in this trial. Celcuity will not receive payment for the testing it performs. We expect our CELx test will provide critical insight after the trial is completed about the patient characteristics most correlative to drug response.
 
In conjunction with the development of the CELx MP Test, Celcuity will seek collaborations with pharmaceutical companies to field clinical trials that evaluate the efficacy of combining HER family inhibitors and c-Met inhibitors in breast cancer patients who have abnormal c-Met and abnormal HER1 pathway activity. The FDA has approved two c-Met inhibitors and six HER-family inhibitors for cancer treatment. Additional c-Met and HER-family inhibitors are being evaluated in on-going clinical trials. Several pharmaceutical companies possess both a c-Met and a HER family inhibitor.
 
The need for more complete cancer diagnoses is significant. The complexity and dynamic nature of cancer makes it difficult to determine the underlying cellular activity driving the disease. Molecular tests are used to identify genetic mutations and select targeted therapies, but the overall impact of those tests on patient outcomes has fallen far short of expectations, primarily due to two factors. First, molecular tests provide a static and limited genetic profile of a patient’s tumor, and, therefore, cannot measure dynamic disease activity. These tests rely on statistical correlations to diagnose patients, and when a genetic mutation is only weakly correlated to oncogenic-related cellular dysfunction, a high number of false positive diagnoses will result. With patient response rates to therapies targeting a genetic mutation typically less than 50%, and in some cases, only 10% to 20%, there is significant need for an alternative approach. Second, many cancers lack a genetic biomarker to guide treatment. For those patients, the cellular dysfunction responsible for their cancer goes undiagnosed, which means they are less likely to receive a potentially beneficial targeted therapy. Thus, current molecular tests have demonstrated only a limited ability to diagnose the specific cellular dysfunction that is driving most patients’ cancer.
 
Our CELx platform addresses the need for better cancer diagnostic tests using two complementary technologies that represent a significant departure from molecular-based analyses. Unlike molecular tests that use fixed or lysed (dead) cells and can only measure the static composition of a cell, our CELx platform measures real-time signaling activity in a patient’s live tumor cells. This enables us to: (1) identify the cellular signaling dysfunction driving a patient’s cancer; and (2) identify the targeted therapy that matches the dysfunction in the patient’s cells. Our CELx tests are performed in our laboratory in Minneapolis, Minnesota that is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, and accredited by the College of American Pathologies, or CAP.
 
Our platform, comprised of our internally developed cell microenvironment and cell signaling quantification technologies, allows for more accurate diagnoses and the discovery of new cancer sub-types. We believe our CELx platform will fundamentally change the standard-of-care many cancer patients receive. Patients with the newly identified cancer sub-types we have discovered have oncogenic pathways that are signaling abnormally, and, we believe, may respond positively to a matching targeted therapy. By identifying patients with a new cancer sub-type, each CELx test will create, in effect, a proprietary patient population that molecular diagnostics cannot identify.
 
Our initial commercial strategy is to partner with pharmaceutical companies to provide companion diagnostics for the pharmaceutical partners’ existing or investigational targeted therapies. We expect such partnerships to involve collaboration on clinical trials, regulatory submissions, and commercialization activities. We will initiate activities to pursue partnerships as our CELx tests become commercially ready and can be matched with a potential partner’s targeted therapies. Our commercial-related efforts to date have focused on seeking partnerships for our CELx HSF and CELx MP tests, which became commercially ready as a laboratory developed test in 2016 and 2018, respectively. We expect to seek pharmaceutical partnerships for a variety of different targeted therapies in other solid tumor types as we are conducting our initial clinical trials with Genentech’s and Puma’s targeted therapies.
 
We believe our CELx tests will expand the matching drug’s market size because they can facilitate approval of new drug indications that a pharmaceutical company would not otherwise be able to obtain.
 
We expect that successful pharmaceutical company partnerships will generate significant revenue from the sale of tests to identify patients eligible for clinical trials, from milestone payments, and, potentially, from royalties on the incremental drug revenues our tests enable. A key requirement for success of these partnerships will be clinical trial results that demonstrate the advantages of using a CELx test as a companion diagnostic. Once a new drug indication is received that requires use of our CDx to identify eligible patients, we will offer our tests directly to treating physicians and coordinate go-to-market strategies with our partner. This coordination of commercialization strategies will allow us to significantly leverage the sales, marketing and reimbursement resources of our pharmaceutical partner, unlike traditional molecular diagnostic companies.

Our Value Proposition
 
We believe we offer a clear and compelling value proposition to the key healthcare stakeholders:
 

· | Patients & Providers—Improved patient outcomes. Our CELx tests provide a more accurate diagnosis of a patient’s cancer driver. This will enable physicians to match more precisely the targeted therapy they use to treat their patients. We believe this will increase the percentage of patients responding to the drug, improving overall patient outcomes significantly. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pharma—Increased revenue & optimized clinical trials. CELx tests can significantly increase the revenue potential for many existing targeted therapies by identifying entirely new pools of patients potentially responsive to their therapy. For some targeted therapies, we estimate a CELx test could double the number of patients approved to receive treatment, thus driving billions of dollars in incremental sales. Also, by providing more precise selection of patients, our CELx tests can increase the odds a clinical trial meets its trial endpoint, greatly enhancing the likelihood the drug will obtain FDA approval for a new indication. In addition, according to an ARK Invest publication dated August 2016, companion diagnostics that increase the response rates of a drug can reduce Phase 3 clinical trial size as much as ten-fold and costs as much as 60%. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Payors—Lower costs per responsive patient. By providing more precise cancer diagnoses and driving higher drug response rates, we will significantly reduce the money spent on drugs that do not benefit patients. Many targeted therapies cost more than $50,000 per treatment and only benefit a small fraction of patients receiving them. Calculating drug costs on a cost-per-responsive patient, and not just cost-per-treated patient, highlights the true cost of targeted therapies and the expense associated with low drug response rates. For instance, a $50,000 targeted therapy with a 30% response rate costs $167,000 per responsive patient; however, that same drug would only cost $83,000 per responsive patient if the response rate was 60%. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We have a number of key strengths that enhance our ability to achieve our mission and build a successful company:
 

· | First mover. We are the first company that we are aware of to launch diagnostic tests that measure the signaling pathway activity in a patient’s live tumor cells, which we believe gives us a significant first mover advantage. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | High barriers to entry. Our issued and pending patents, as well as our proprietary information and trade secrets, give us a strong intellectual property position that we believe creates a significant barrier to entry for potential competitors. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Broad range of applications for our platform. We can develop tests for a wide range of signaling pathways and a wide range of cancer types. This allows us to build a deep new product pipeline that creates multiple paths to build a large and profitable business. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Diverse revenue streams including pharma partnerships. We anticipate generating significant revenue from CDx pharmaceutical partners, including revenue from the sale of tests to identify patients eligible for clinical trials, milestone payments, and potentially, from royalties on the incremental drug revenues our tests enable. Our most significant revenue opportunity comes from ongoing sales of CELx tests to physicians during the commercialization stage of the CDx. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strong senior leadership team. Our founders and senior leaders have a proven track record of success building, operating and selling several successful companies. We have deep and highly relevant and complementary diagnostic, scientific, product development, and commercialization experience that has enabled us to establish market leadership positions for the companies we previously led. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Platform Advantages
 
Our unique and proprietary CELx functional cellular analysis technology represents a major shift from the diagnostic industry’s reliance on molecular profiling to characterize a patient’s cancer sub-type. Our goal is to leverage our technology to build a durable competitive advantage that enables us to improve outcomes for a significant percentage of cancer patients.
 
Our CELx platform advantages include:
 

· | Powerful cancer sub-type discovery tool. We have already discovered 16 new potential cancer sub-types that are not currently diagnosed and treated with a matching targeted therapy. These sub-types are characterized by the dysfunctional signaling pathway activity our CELx tests identify. By identifying new cancer sub-types, we are creating new patient populations to which pharmaceutical companies can offer new and existing drug therapies. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Direct patient-specific assessment of disease status. Even though the response rates for many targeted therapeutics are low, for those patients who do respond, their outcomes can be improved significantly. The problem is matching the patient to the right drug. Our platform overcomes this problem by directly identifying whether an oncogenic signaling pathway is abnormally active in a patient’s cells. This provides the most complete assessment available today of the intracellular activity driving a patient’s cancer. Existing genomic tests typically can only provide a determination whether cancer is present and an assessment of molecular mutations that may or may not be associated with the patient’s cancer driver. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Direct measurement of matching drug effectiveness. An important advantage of the CELx platform is its ability to quantify the amount of signaling dysfunction that a matching targeted therapy can inhibit in an individual patient’s cancer cells. This allows us to evaluate whether there are inherent drug resistance mechanisms that would prevent the therapy from functioning in the patient’s tumor cells. Molecular tests cannot provide this evaluation. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Improved response rates. We believe a patient population will have a higher response rate to a matching targeted therapy when it is diagnosed with a CELx test than with a molecular biomarker. By first identifying whether dysfunctional signaling is present and then confirming that a matching targeted therapy can inhibit the dysfunction, a CELx test eliminates the two primary variables that confound patient response to targeted therapy signaling: the presence or absence of the disease and the drug not functioning as intended. A molecular test provides insight on neither of these variables in most cases. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Identify drug responsive proprietary patient cohorts. There are large numbers of cancer patients who lack a genetic biomarker to guide treatment. For these patients, the cellular dysfunction driving the cancer goes undiagnosed, thus excluding such patients from receiving a potentially beneficial targeted therapy. We believe our CELx tests will enable us to identify new proprietary patient populations not currently diagnosable with molecular tests and increase the number of patients likely to respond to a matching targeted therapy. Moreover, we will be the only partner a pharmaceutical company can work with to develop a CDx for a new indication of a targeted therapy addressing these new patient populations. By contrast, most molecular diagnostic tests are undifferentiated and have little proprietary value, which gives pharmaceutical companies a wide range of companies to select from when choosing a molecular-based CDx partner. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Streamlined FDA approval of targeted therapeutics. CELx tests will enable our pharmaceutical partners to enroll patients in their clinical trial with the same cellular dysfunction their targeted therapy is designed to inhibit. We believe this will improve patient response rates, increasing the likelihood the trial meets its endpoint target and thus the likelihood the drug receives FDA approval. Improved patient response rates would also help reduce the size, cost, and length of our partner’s clinical trials.

Our Industry
 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, cancer was the second-leading cause of death in the United States in 2017, responsible for nearly one of every four deaths. There are many types of cancer treatment options, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy, stem cell transplant, and targeted therapy. Targeted therapies are drugs or other substances that block the growth and spread of cancer by interfering with specific molecular targets involved in the progression of cancer. Targeted therapies differ from standard chemotherapy drugs in that they are often cytostatic (block tumor cell proliferation) rather than cytotoxic (kill tumor cells). According to the National Cancer Institute, there are currently more than 80 approved targeted oncology therapies, some of which cost more than $100,000 per treatment course.
 
Diagnostic tests to detect single biomarkers are now widely used by pathologists to determine the molecular sub-type of a cancer. When a molecular biomarker test is used to support the choice of therapy to prescribe, it is often referred to as a “companion diagnostic”, or CDx. Increasing numbers of targeted therapeutics are prescribed based on the results from a companion diagnostic test to detect the presence of a molecular biomarker. Only patients testing positive for the biomarker are eligible to receive the associated therapy.
 
Companion diagnostics are becoming increasingly important to the pharmaceutical industry. The use of companion diagnostics to better match patients to effective treatments positively impacts clinical outcomes and lowers expenditures on drugs that do not benefit patients. Stratifying the eligible patient population to include only likely responders is particularly important when the percentage of likely responders is only a fraction of the total cancer population. In these circumstances, narrowing the eligible patient population is often necessary to meet the clinical endpoint targets required to receive FDA drug approval.
 
Our Market Opportunities
 
CDx Development Opportunities
 
We believe there at least 50 different potential opportunities for our company to collaborate on CDx programs with pharmaceutical companies. Our ability to develop partnering relationships with these pharmaceutical companies will be predicated on a number of factors, including the size of the patient population our CELx test identifies, the remaining patent life of the matching targeted therapy, as well as the success or failure of clinical trials we have conducted with other pharmaceutical companies. Completing clinical trials requires, among other things, successful enrollment of patients, meeting trial endpoint goals, and completing the trial in a timely manner. The time to complete a clinical trial can vary widely depending on a number of factors, many of which will be specific to any particular clinical trial.

We believe the revenue opportunity per CDx program will be consistent with other development programs pharmaceutical companies support. In addition, the revenue for an individual CDx program would represent only a small fraction of the potential value the new drug indication our CDx could create for our pharmaceutical company partner. For some drugs, our tests could double the number of patients eligible for a targeted therapy.
 
CELx Testing Opportunities
 
We expect to generate recurring CDx testing revenues once a CELx CDx-linked drug therapy is approved for patient use. On average, we believe that the lifetime value of providing the CDx test will significantly exceed the revenue generated from the CDx development program. We expect to offer each CELx test to patients at prices ranging from $4,000–$7,000, depending on the number of pathways evaluated. No tests directly comparable to the CELx tests are available today to offer reference points for pricing purposes. Pricing for several proprietary complex genomic tests, however, fall within this range and we believe this provides guidance on the amount insurance companies are willing to pay for highly informative tests that guide patient care.
CELx Technology Background
 
The Role of Cellular Signaling Pathways in Cancer
 
Cancer is a class of exceedingly complex and diverse diseases characterized by the development of abnormal cells that divide uncontrollably and can infiltrate and destroy normal body tissue and disrupt normal organ function. In normal cells, a series of biochemical activities, known as signal transduction, transmit biochemical signals through an interconnected network of signaling pathways to control cell proliferation and survival. Cancer arises when alterations occur in one or more of these signaling pathways and normal cell processes are disrupted, resulting in uncontrolled cell proliferation. These alterations are driven by a variety of cellular aberrations, including genetic mutations and dysfunctional signaling pathway mechanisms. Identifying the alteration driving an individual’s cancer is complicated by the immense complexity of these signal transduction processes and the practically unquantifiable number of pathway variables.
 
As recently as 20 years ago, most cancers were classified and subsequently treated solely on the basis of the anatomical location of the tumor in the body. Chemotherapies that kill rapidly dividing cells were widely used, but they had only limited efficacy for many patients and caused a wide range of dangerous side effects due to lack of discrimination for tumor tissue. As tools to identify molecular mutations became available, scientists began to uncover correlations between certain molecular mutations, cancer tissue type, and a patient’s prognosis. This fostered the development of molecularly targeted therapeutics that were designed to disrupt the specific cellular function of the drug target, typically abnormal signaling pathway activity, associated with the molecular mutation. These targeted therapies greatly improved outcomes for some cancer patients and are a testament to the efficacy of targeted therapies when effectively prescribed. According to information published by the Journal of Clinical Oncology in July 2015, targeted therapies are oftentimes 10 to 20 times more expensive than chemotherapies.
 
In conjunction with the advent of targeted therapies, new molecular diagnostics were developed to help physicians refine the classification of a patient’s cancer into sub-types based on the presence of specific molecular anomalies, such as genetic mutations or over-expressed proteins. Such mutations or over-expressed proteins are commonly referred to as “biomarkers” when they are used to diagnose a disease and evaluate treatment options. For instance, breast cancer diagnostic tests are performed to determine whether two protein biomarkers, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) or estrogen receptors (ER), are overexpressed in the cancer cells. The results of these tests are used to classify the patient’s cancer molecular sub-type and to guide selection of a corresponding targeted drug therapy.
 
The launch and on-going development of many new targeted therapies and the increasing use of companion molecular diagnostics to guide selection of the most appropriate therapy for each patient ushered in the era of so-called “precision medicine” in oncology. Advances in genomic and proteomic techniques and drug discovery enabled researchers to identify new drug targets, new molecular diagnostics, and drugs that would specifically bind to the target.
 
While the increased usage of targeted therapies has improved patient outcomes, there is increasing recognition that the promise of molecularly guided diagnoses and targeted treatment has fallen far short of expectations. This is generally due to the heterogeneous nature of these diseases from patient to patient and the challenge of identifying the specific cellular dysfunction driving a cancer patient’s tumor growth. No matter how sophisticated or detailed, a point-in-time molecular profile can only provide a snapshot of a tumor. As a result, the genetic mutations many current tests identify are often only weakly correlated to the abnormal signaling driving a patient’s cancer. This is because protein and gene profiling provide an incomplete assessment of the biochemical activity promoting cancer tumor growth. In fact, when dysfunctional, the activity of signaling pathway networks are, we believe, not possible to assess using current genetic analyses, despite the impressive investments in mapping the human genome and advancements in techniques to identify molecular mutations.

The combination of the heterogeneous nature of cancer and the weak correlation of abnormal signaling to many genetic mutations helps explain why the response rates for patients treated with many targeted therapies are often less than 50%, and in some cases as low as 10% to 20%. For a patient to respond to a targeted therapy designed to disrupt disease-related signaling activity, two factors must be present: (1) the patient’s diseased cells must have the same signaling pathway dysfunction the drug is designed to inhibit, and (2) the drug affects its targeted pathway as intended. Current state-of-the-art genomic tests use fixed (dead) cells, which limits them to evaluating the presence or concentration of a genetic mutation or protein. These tests cannot evaluate either dynamic signaling activity or whether a drug can affect that activity. When a patient’s genomic biomarker status does not represent underlying signaling pathway dysfunction, this can lead to selection of the wrong targeted therapy to treat the patient. Of particular interest to us are those patients with dysfunctional signaling who lack a corresponding biomarker; they are not currently eligible to receive any targeted therapy that treats their dysfunctional signaling.
 
To measure dynamic cellular activity, living patient tumor cells are required. Until our advancements, efforts to use living patient tumor cells have been limited by the lack of reliable methods to extract and culture cancer cells from patient tumors. These previously limited efforts reflect the emphasis amongst cancer researchers on creating stable cell lines for use to model cell function or to studies screen millions of test compounds in drug discovery programs. Pharmaceutical companies driving the commercial development of cell technologies work primarily with immortalized cells or cell lines genetically modified to express a target or mutation of interest. These cell lines consist of established cell cultures that proliferate indefinitely and very uniformly. They are used primarily because they provide a highly uniform response when tested with millions of small molecules in the search for potential new drugs, and because techniques to culture these cells are well known, their properties well understood, and other experimental results using them are available for comparison purposes. Conversely, live patient tumor cells are difficult to obtain, are only available in small quantities, and according to a 2014 article published by Science, the percentage of tumors that yield proliferative cells with conventional culturing methods has until now been well below 50%, which required months of culturing to obtain sufficient testable quantities of cells. For these reasons, researchers prefer paraffin-fixed tissue or cell lines over living tumor cells when studying disease processes or screening drug candidates. This lack of compelling rationale for pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to work with live tumor cells for research purposes left the field of live tumor cell research in a relatively immature state.
 
Our CELx Platform
 
We have made significant investments in research and development to build the first commercially-ready cancer diagnostic platform that we are aware of that measures the signaling pathway activity in a patient’s living tumor cells. To measure dynamic cellular activity, we internally developed two distinct but complementary technologies, which now comprise our CELx platform:

· | our proprietary cell microenvironment; and
--+-------------------------------------------


· | our method to quantify dynamic patient cell signaling dysfunction.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We utilize our CELx platform to create CELx tests that measure specific signaling pathway activity in various tumor types.
 
Cell microenvironment.   Previous research has shown that cancer cells extracted from a patient’s tumor share the molecular features of the primary cancers from which they were derived and could provide an ex vivo (outside the patient) model of a patient’s tumor. The technology around tumor cell extraction from individual patients and culturing techniques, however, has largely remained undeveloped. For instance, we are not aware of any competing diagnostic tests that use live patient tumor cells to measure dynamic cell signaling activity. Studies on the topic have historically highlighted the challenges of deriving a viable patient tumor cell sample from an individual patient tumor specimen.
 
We have developed a cell microenvironment to extract and expand viable tumor cells from fresh human tumor tissue, which meets the three critical clinical parameters a patient-derived tumor cell sample would need to satisfy in order to meet the regulatory and clinical requirements for a diagnostic test measuring signaling activity:
 

· | The patient cell sample tested must reflect the starting tumor’s composition. If samples do not reflect the original tumor’s composition, test results derived from that sample may not be representative of the patient’s tumor. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The sample must be available for testing in less than 21 days. Clinicians generally require test results in cases of complex diseases such as cancer within two to three weeks so they can begin treatment of their patient as soon as the initial symptoms are evaluated or a preliminary diagnosis is made. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | At least 90% of the tumor specimens obtained from a patient must yield testable samples. Clinicians will only order tests that require a patient specimen when they are highly likely to receive a test result. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Dynamic patient cell signaling quantification.   The second component of our CELx platform involves methods to quantify specific dynamic signal transduction events in patient derived tumor cells. The complexity of signal transduction processes is immense and the permutations of the pathway variables are practically unquantifiable. Current analytical methods to assess these variables use dead (fixed or lysed) cells. Point-in-time measurements are limited to assessment of the compositional status (e.g. mutation), concentration level (e.g. protein amount), or activation status (e.g. phosphorylation) of a finite number of signaling pathway components. A key insight underlying our technology was our observation that, no matter how sophisticated or detailed, a point-in-time molecular profile would only provide a snapshot. These methods could not provide a complete, dynamic assessment of the signaling activity driving a patient’s cancer. These point-in-time molecular analyses would, in many cases, only provide a weak correlation to the presence of the signaling pathway dysfunction driving a patient’s cancer. Instead, we concluded that a complete diagnosis of cancer and an assessment of a patient’s response to treating their disease requires measurement of the underlying activity of signaling pathways in live patient tumor cells.

To measure live real-time dynamic cell signaling activity, we utilize an impedance biosensor instrument. An impedance biosensor is an analytical platform that converts changes in cellular activity to a measurable electrical signal. When cells are stimulated and change their function, the accompanying changes alter the electrical signal that is measured. The output value is quantified over time and used to determine a Signaling Function Score. ​To determine the activity of a specific signaling pathway, an activating agent specific to a pathway receptor is used to turn on the pathway and a corresponding inhibitory agent specific to the pathway receptor is used to turn signaling off. When signaling pathways are stimulated in this manner, a change in the electrical signal occurs and Signaling Function Score recorded. By relying on the principle of detecting signaling pathway activity, we believe we can develop tests for a range of disease types and targeted therapies that affect various cellular pathways.
 
We believe our pioneering efforts have substantially advanced the technology of culturing primary tumor cells and analyzing cell signaling activity to guide therapy selection. We have two issued U.S. patents, one issued international patent, five pending U.S. patent applications, 19 pending non-U.S. patent applications and one pending international PCT patent application, as well as significant proprietary know-how and trade secrets for the various cell sample preparation and cellular analysis methods we have developed.
 
New Product Development
 
We are leveraging our CELx technology to discover new cancer sub-types that a genomic test cannot detect. These new sub-types are characterized by the hyperactive signaling pathway our test identifies. These sub-types cannot be detected by genomic tests because they lack a corresponding molecular biomarker to identify it. We will translate our discoveries into diagnostic tests.
 
We have already discovered several new breast cancer sub-types: HER2-negative breast cancers with either abnormal HER2 signaling or abnormal HER-family signaling coincident with abnormal c-Met signaling.
 
We are currently conducting research to identify additional cancer sub-types in five solid tumor types. Our research studies to date have identified 12 potentially new breast, lung, ovarian, kidney, and bladder cancer sub-types that involve dysfunctional oncogenic signaling pathways. Multiple dysfunctional pathways were active in each of these tumor types. These studies confirm that the CELx platform can be a cancer sub-type discovery engine and that we can create a multi-pathway test to identify the specific driver in a patient’s tumor. We expect to eventually expand the tumor types we evaluate to include colon, head and neck, leukemia, esophageal, and gastric cancers.
 
We will seek to identify individual signaling pathways that may be driving at least 5% to 10% of the total cancers in each tissue area. Once we have characterized the prevalence of the different sub-types of signaling dysfunction in each tumor type and validated the tests for the different pathways, our plan will be to launch a corresponding CELx test. Eventually, each CELx test will analyze multiple pathways in a patient’s tumor to identify the specific pathway dysfunction driving a patient’s cancer. Testing multiple pathways will thus provide a systems view of the patient’s cancer using dynamic functional analysis. We believe this will result in more accurate diagnosis of a patient compared to molecular diagnostics that are using next generation sequencing to assess the status of multiple static biomarkers.
 
Clinical Trial Approach
 
A major component of our development and commercial activities is providing clinical data from interventional clinical trials using our CELx tests. Our clinical trial strategy is predicated on proving the correlation between our CELx Signaling Function Score and a patient’s clinical results. Once our first trial demonstrates that our CELx test identifies patients responsive to HER2 targeted therapies, we expect pharmaceutical companies to partner with us to fund trials to evaluate new potential indications for their drugs with patients identified by one of our CELx tests. The trials will be designed to confirm that patients with abnormal pathway signaling obtain a superior clinical response to a therapy targeting that pathway than to the standard-of-care therapy they currently receive.
 
For trials involving patients not currently eligible for a cancer drug that targets a certain pathway, we would first obtain a tissue specimen from each subject and perform the CELx test to identify subjects who have abnormal signaling. These patients would then be randomly assigned to either an arm that receives the current standard-of-care therapy or one that includes the current standard-of-care therapy plus the targeted therapy. All patients would be monitored until their disease progresses or until the end of the treatment regimen.

CELx Multi-Pathway Signaling Function Test 
 
Our CELx MP Test is a qualitative laboratory developed test that measures HER2 and c-Met signaling activity in tumor cells obtained from patients previously diagnosed with HER2-negative breast cancer to determine whether or not the patients have one of two cancer sub-types:
 

1. | Abnormal HER2 signaling driven cancer
---+--------------------------------------


2. | Abnormal c-Met and HER2 signaling driven cancer
---+------------------------------------------------

Abnormal HER2 Signaling Driven Cancer
 
Approximately 15% of breast cancer patients are diagnosed with HER2+ breast cancer when their tumor cells are found to have overexpressed or amplified levels of HER2. These patients are treated with anti-HER2 targeted therapies in combination with chemotherapies. Results from a number of clinical trial results for HER2 drugs reveal that only about 40% of HER2-positive patients respond to them. In addition, findings from several clinical trials have shown that a sub-set of HER2-negative patients benefit from therapies that target HER2. These results highlight the relatively weak correlation between HER2 receptor or gene amplification status and drug response.
 
Despite the widely recognized role that a dysfunctional HER2-related signaling network plays in promoting breast cancer, only tests measuring a single reactant, HER2 protein, are performed in the clinic to diagnose it; we believe no diagnostic tests are available today that measure HER2 signaling activity within a patient’s breast tumor epithelial cells. This focus on measuring HER2 expression-levels reflects the widely-held view that measuring a patient’s HER2 status is sufficient to diagnose HER2-driven breast cancers. When only HER2 expression is measured, though, patients classified as HER2-negative but whose tumor cells have abnormal HER2 signaling are diagnosed as not having HER2-driven breast cancer, when, in fact, they do.
 
Since current genomic methods cannot identify HER2-negative breast cancer patients who have the HER2-driven cancer, a new method was required. Such a method would need to analyze the HER2-signaling pathways (MAPK and PI3K) associated with HER2 cancers in a patient’s tumor cells. Our CELx MP Test identifies patients whose HER2 status as determined by conventional techniques does not represent the correct diagnosis of their breast cancer at a functional level.
 
For the sub-group of HER2-negative breast cancer patients diagnosed with abnormal HER2-signaling, it would be intended that they receive treatment with HER2 therapies.
 
Abnormal c-Met Signaling coincident with Abnormal HER2 signaling
 
Signaling through c-Met is necessary for normal cell development. Numerous studies have established the significant role of the c-Met pathway in tumor growth and metastasis. Cross-talk between c-Met and HER family receptors is also suspected of playing a role in tumor progression and resistance to HER targeted therapies. Numerous clinical trials have evaluated dual inhibition of c-Met and HER pathways in a variety of tumor types, but they have produced mostly negative results. Since subjects enrolled in these trials were primarily ones with c-Met protein overexpression or gene amplification, other biological factors, such as c-Met and HER signaling activity, are likely more important to measure when identifying patients eligible for c-Met therapies.
 
Celcuity’s recent studies found that a subset of HER2-negative breast cancer patients has abnormal c-Met signaling coincident with abnormal HER2 signaling. The c-Met expression level of each patient studied was normal. Strong evidence was found that c-Met and HER2 signaling is co-involved and may explain why a c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor is not an effective antagonistic when c-Met is hyperactive for this patient sub-set. Additionally, evidence was found that simultaneous inhibition of HER1, HER2, and HER3 signaling, in addition to inhibition of c-Met signaling, was necessary to inhibit HER2 and c-Met signaling activity most effectively.
 
For the sub-group of HER2-negative breast cancer patients diagnosed with abnormal c-Met and HER2-signaling, it would be intended that they receive treatment with a combination of pan-HER and c-Met inhibitors.
 
Interventional Clinical Trials in Process using a CELx Test to Select Patients for Treatment
 
FACT 1 Clinical Trial to Evaluate Efficacy of Genentech’s HER2 Drugs
 
In May 2017, we entered into a Clinical Trial Agreement with NSABP to conduct a 54-patient single-arm Phase II interventional trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Genentech’s drugs, Herceptin® (trastuzumab) and Perjeta® (pertuzumab), and chemotherapy, in breast cancer patients selected with Celcuity’s CELx HSF Test. Pursuant to the agreement, NSABP serves as the Sponsor and Principal Investigator of the trial and is responsible for, among other things, setting up clinical sites, enrolling patients, and managing clinical data. NSABP has contracted separately with Genentech to provide Herceptin and Perjeta for the study at no cost. We are performing the CELx HSF Test to select patients for the trial and are providing the funding for the trial’s patient-related costs. Completing this trial will require, among other things, successful enrollment of patients, meeting trial endpoint goals, and completing the trial in a timely manner. As of February 2019, there were 14 activated sites participating in the FACT 1 trial. Since the enrollment rate of patients at these sites has fallen short of the expectations NSABP originally provided, NSABP has agreed to activate up to 16 additional sites, for a total of 30 sites. We expect the addition of these sites will increase the cost to Celcuity of the FACT 1 trial by up to $650,000. Based on NSABP’s updated estimates of patient enrollment rates, we expect to obtain interim results in late 2019 and final results approximately nine months later.

NSABP is one of the country’s premier clinical research cooperatives. Its members include many of the country’s leading medical centers and their investigators are amongst the most-respected in the breast cancer field. Genentech is one of the largest biopharmaceutical companies in the world and was the first company to launch a HER2 targeted therapy; their anti-HER2 targeted therapies have roughly 95% market share.
 
We submitted an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application to the FDA to obtain approval to use our CELx HSF Test in a clinical trial setting. The IDE submission included validation test protocols and study reports, manufacturing process summaries, and relevant publications. The FDA approved our IDE in early 2017.
 
The goal is to demonstrate that patients who have an abnormal HER2 signaling pathway, as identified by our CELx HSF Test, respond to treatment with a matching targeted therapy. A synopsis of the trial protocol is provided below.

Our agreement with NSABP may be terminated by one or either party upon certain events, such as: (i) the FDA withdrawing its authorization and approval to perform the study, (ii) NSABP determining that the human and/or toxicology test results support termination of the study, (iii) either us or NSABP determining that an adverse reaction or side-effect of drugs administered in the study or a modification of the study’s protocol raises safety issues to support termination of the study, (iv) either party remaining in material breach of the agreement for a period of 30 days following notice of such breach, (v) us not performing the CELx Tests or providing study kits, (vi) us failing to pay amounts owed to NSABP, and/or (vii) Genentech terminating its agreement with NSABP to supply drugs for the study or the drugs for the study no longer being manufactured or being available.
 
FACT 2 Clinical Trial to Evaluate Efficacy of Puma Biotechnology’s HER2 drug
 
In October 2018, we entered into a Clinical Trial Agreement with Puma Biotechnology, Inc. and West Cancer Center, to conduct a 27-patient Phase II single-arm interventional trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Puma’s drug, NERLYNX® (neratinib), and chemotherapy, in breast cancer patients selected with Celcuity’s CELx HSF Test. Pursuant to this agreement, West Cancer Center will serve as the sponsor and principal investigator of the trial and is responsible for enrolling patients and managing clinical data. Puma will supply NERLYNX, its pan-HER inhibitor currently approved by the FDA for extended adjuvant treatment of early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. We will provide the CELx HSF Test to select triple-negative breast cancer patients who have hyperactive HER2-driven signaling pathways for the trial and will initially fund the patient-related trial costs. All required regulatory and Institutional Review Board approvals have been obtained for the FACT 2 trial, and West Cancer Center expects to activate the trial in early 2019. We expect interim results from this trial in late 2019 or early 2020 and final results approximately 12 months later.
 
Celcuity submitted an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application to the FDA to use its CELx HSF Test for this clinical trial and received approval in mid-2018.
 
The goal of the trial is to demonstrate that triple-negative breast cancer patients who have a hyperactive HER2 signaling tumor, as identified by the CELx test, respond to treatment with NERLYNX, a matching HER2 therapy. Celcuity believes there is significant clinical interest in finding new diagnostic tests and targeted therapies for triple-negative breast cancer patients because fewer drug treatment options are available to them relative to other breast cancer sub-types.

Commercialization Strategy
 
Our commercial activities will target three complementary groups at various phases of the development of our CELx tests.
 

· | Pharmaceutical companies. For each CELx test we develop to diagnose a new cancer sub-type, we will identify the matching targeted therapies, either currently approved or in the investigational phase, and the manufacturer of those therapies. We will initiate discussions and seek to reach development agreements with each of these pharmaceutical companies when we have verified the prevalence of the cancer sub-type and completed successful animal studies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Medical and surgical oncologists. We will initially target key opinion leaders, or KOLs, in each cancer type once we have completed the analytical validation of a CELx test. This will allow us to build awareness and credibility for the CELx test as we are generating clinical validation data. When a new drug indication is received that requires use of a CELx CDx to identify eligible patients, we will coordinate the pharmaceutical company’s go-to-market activities with our own. This coordination will allow us to significantly leverage the pharmaceutical company’s sales, marketing, and reimbursement, unlike traditional molecular diagnostic companies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Payors. We will initiate pilot activities with payors for late stage patients during the clinical validation phase of a CELx test’s development. We will expand our payor efforts to include health economics analysis once we have clinical trial data available. When a new drug indication is received that requires use of a CELx CDx to identify eligible patients, we expect to coordinate the pharmaceutical company’s reimbursement activities with our own. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our CELx tests are laboratory developed tests and subject to regulation under CLIA. We completed the analytical validation of our first CELx test and received CLIA certification in 2016, at which time our CELx HSF Test was ready to sell commercially on a stand-alone basis to treating physicians. We expect to generate revenues from CELx tests performed in conjunction with the clinical trials a pharmaceutical company will field during the clinical phase of our partners’ drug approval process. We also expect that the agreements we enter into with the pharmaceutical companies partnering with us on these trials will include milestone payments at initiation and completion of trials and perhaps at various other negotiated points during the trials. We expect to generate revenue from the sale of CELx tests ordered by physicians either as stand-alone diagnostics or, upon the approval of our pharmaceutical company’s matching drug, as a CDx. A key requirement for success of these partnerships will be clinical trial results that demonstrate the advantages of using a CELx test as a companion diagnostic.
 
We intend to position our unique and highly differentiated tests as practice changing advancements in patient care. To inform key stakeholders of the value of our solution in order to drive adoption and reimbursement, we expect to employ the following diverse commercialization strategies over time:
 

· | leverage our pharmaceutical partnership and their go-to-market initiatives for the drug our CDx is partnered with;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | collaborate with oncology thought and KOLs and leading institutions on clinical research, publications, and product development;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | build an experienced, oncology-focused sales force in the United States and international distribution channels that are supported by dedicated company personnel;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | integrate into the everyday practice of clinicians through our medical affairs and client services efforts;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | publish important medical and scientific data in peer-reviewed journals and present at major industry conferences, conduct clinical trials; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | work with patient advocacy groups, leading cancer philanthropic organizations, and medical societies to drive awareness of CELx tests and the importance of incorporating functional cellular analysis into cancer treatment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Through these efforts, we will seek to promote our CELx test’s unique capabilities throughout the oncology community—from patients, to the physicians treating them, to the third-party payors for these treatments and to biopharmaceutical companies developing new treatments—all with the goal of facilitating better-informed treatment decisions for the greatest number of patients.

A CELx test would be launched to the broader market upon the approval of a pharmaceutical company’s matching drug as a CDx. We would expect physicians, typically a medical or surgical oncologist, to order our tests in conjunction with the roll-out of the pharmaceutical company’s matching drug. The physician will prescribe a CELx test and coordinate provision of a patient specimen from a biopsy or surgical procedure. The fresh tissue would then be shipped overnight directly to our laboratory where we would use our proprietary methods to extract diseased cell samples from the patient’s tissue and perform the CELx tests ordered. Test results would typically be available in 10 to 14 days after receipt of the patient specimen. For each patient sample analyzed, a Signaling Function Score would be calculated quantitatively and converted into a final qualitative result: abnormal or normal. For patients found to have an abnormal signaling function, clinicians would use the results of the CELx test as a guide to select a targeted drug that inhibits the abnormal signaling activity identified.
 
United States
 
For our first tests, we will target the estimated 4,300 medical oncologists working in hospitals and cancer centers in the United States. We expect to hire domestic sales professionals with typically over 10 years of experience in clinical oncology sales working at leading biopharmaceutical or specialty reference laboratory companies.
 
In general, we intend to focus our initial sales efforts on building relationships with KOLs and researchers at leading academic research institutions to demonstrate the scientific credibility of our CELx tests. We also plan to build relationships in community oncology practice settings through leading physician networks and community hospitals and community based cancer centers. We will also attend national and regional clinical meetings focused on cancer treatment for our anti-cancer tests.
 
We believe the unique and important nature of the results our CELx tests provide, and their positioning as a CDx, will drive many medical oncologists to independently seek out our tests once they become aware of them. We believe this may allow us to achieve our market penetration goals with a sales force and marketing expenses significantly less costly than has been experienced by molecular diagnostic companies.
 
International
 
We believe we can serve the international market from our laboratory in Minnesota. We expect to establish an international presence using local distributors that sell to physicians and coordinate shipment of specimens to the United States. To serve international markets, we would expect to add dedicated regional managers located outside the United States to oversee our relationships at the local level.
Pricing and Reimbursement
 
The principal groups that we expect to pay us in the future for our CELx tests include:
 

· | commercial third-party payors;
--+-------------------------------


· | government payors, including Medicare and state Medicaid plans;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | biopharmaceutical customers;
--+-----------------------------


· | hospitals, cancer centers, and other institutions; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | patients.
--+----------

 
Adequate reimbursement will be an important factor in achieving broad clinical adoption of our CELx tests. At the same time, we believe broad clinical adoption will help drive favorable reimbursement decisions. To achieve broad reimbursement coverage with commercial third-party payors and government payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, we plan to demonstrate the economic and clinical value of our CELx tests to payors by employing a multi-pronged strategy:
 

· | Set a high bar for analytical validation. We expect to present data on the reproducibility and precision of CELx tests at conferences and will seek to publish the results in peer-reviewed journals. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Meet the evidence standards necessary to be consistent with leading clinical guidelines. We believe inclusion in leading clinical practice guidelines plays a critical role in payers’ coverage decisions. We plan to conduct clinical validation and clinical utility studies that are consistent with the requirements of the widely recognized National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical practice guidelines. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Execute an internal managed care policy and claims adjudication function as part of our core business operations. We plan to make obtaining adequate and widespread reimbursement a critical component of our business operations. We expect to hire a team of in-house claims processing and reimbursement specialists who will work with patients and payers to navigate the claims process and obtain maximum reimbursement. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cultivate a network of KOLs. KOLs are able to influence clinical practice by publishing research and determining whether new tests should be integrated into practice guidelines. We expect to collaborate with KOLs early in the development process to ensure our clinical studies are designed and executed in a way that clearly demonstrates the benefits of our tests to physicians and payers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


15
--


· | Compile a growing library of peer-reviewed studies that demonstrate the test is effective. We will seek to publish peer-reviewed articles and review papers to help support our efforts to obtain widespread adoption and reimbursement of our CELx tests. In each disease area we pursue, we intend to conduct studies in order to develop similar supporting literature. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reduce expenditures. We intend to build economic models to measure the financial benefits of using our CELx test in guiding patient treatment and minimizing the use of drugs that will not likely have a positive impact. We plan to use the data we gather through the use of these models as we meet with commercial third-party payors and government payors. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Commercial third-party payors and government payors are increasingly making significant efforts to contain healthcare costs. A major cost reduction opportunity is to reduce expenditures for drug courses that provide no patient benefit. Our technology will enable physicians to prescribe therapies that have significantly higher response rates than has been the case with targeted therapies to date. Since this will lower the drug cost per responsive patient, we believe widespread use of our CELx tests is consistent with payors goals of delivering health care more cost effectively. ​ 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competition
 
At present, we are not aware of any other companies that offer diagnostic tests that use a patient’s live tumor cells to identify the signaling pathway driving a patient’s cancer. There are several companies focused on developing genomic or proteomic analyses of a patient’s diseased cells. Initial efforts identified protein targets or genetic mutations, oftentimes referred to as “biomarkers,” that are associated with a disease process to enable development of drugs more closely tailored to specific patient populations.
 
As tools for human genome analysis have become less expensive, a number of companies have also recently launched more complex genomic test panels and gene expression signatures tests. These tests rely on a static measurement of molecular properties and mathematical analysis to identify statistically significant correlations between the selected molecular properties and a clinical condition or outcome of populations of patients with the “same” disease.
 
These genetic tests often have limited predictive success because they only identify some, but not all of, the molecular and cellular conditions required for a drug therapy to function in a patient. They may identify the presence of the genes associated with a disease but they cannot determine how the gene products function in the context of a particular individual.
 
Providers of genomic or proteomic tests includes diagnostic kit manufacturers, hospitals and independent laboratories. We do not plan to develop tests where a molecular biomarker can identify drug responsive patients, so our current tests will not compete directly against the tests provided by these other companies. The table below provides a summary of the points of differentiation between our signaling function analysis approach and the molecular approaches used by our potential competitors.

Current Molecular Methods vs. Celcuity’s Functional Cellular Analysis Platform
 

 | Type of Cell Sample Used: 
-------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Dead tumor cells (fixed, lysed) | Live tumor cells 
Type of Analysis Performed | Single point-in-time mutation(s) status or protein amount, or activation status | Quantify signaling pathway activity over 24-hour period 
Relationship to disease driver | Correlative | Direct Cause 
Disease driver evaluated | No. Only a single or small set of components of the cell are evaluated | Yes. The activity of the entire signaling pathway is assessed 
Drug function evaluated | No. Cannot assess drug function with dead cells | Yes. Drug’s effect on signaling pathway activity in patient’s cells quantified
Companies | Foundation Medicine, Caris Life Sciences, NeoGenomics, LabCorp, Quest, Nanostring, Paradigm, Biocept, Exosome Diagnostics, Guardant Health, Roche Diagnostics, Qiagen, Myriad, Genomic Health | Celcuity 

 
We are not aware of any available tests directly comparable to the CELx tests. We expect to offer each CELx test to patients at list prices ranging from $4,000 to $7,000, depending on the number of pathways evaluated. List prices for several proprietary complex genomic tests fall within this range, and we believe this provides guidance as to the pricing of highly informative tests that guide cancer patient care.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We believe one of our core competitive advantages is the strength of our intellectual property portfolio. We developed our CELx technology internally. We are seeking both U.S. and non-U.S. patents to protect our inventions. We have two issued U.S. patents, one issued international patient, five pending U.S. patent applications, 19 pending non-U.S. patent applications, one pending PCT patent application, as well as numerous corresponding non-U.S. patent applications covering our diagnostic approach using cell signaling analysis in living patient cells to guide treatment of patients with targeted therapies. The earliest expiration date of patents is 2033. In addition, we have developed significant proprietary know-how and trade secrets for the various cell sample preparation and cellular analysis methods we have developed.
 
We understand we must develop and maintain protection on the proprietary aspects of our technologies in order to remain competitive. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality, material transfer agreements, invention assignment agreements and other contracts to protect our intellectual property rights.
 
We plan to develop names for new products and apply for trademarks and as appropriate secure trademark protection for them, including domain name registration, in relevant jurisdictions. We also have developed a number of proprietary methods, materials, processes, and techniques related to the preparation of patient samples and performance of the CELx test that we believe are most effectively protected as trade secrets rather than as patented subject matter.
 
Research and Development
 
We have made significant investments in research and development for our CELx platform. Our annual research and development expenses were approximately $5.0 million and $6.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively.
Principal Suppliers
 
We purchase commercially available reagents and instruments from a variety of suppliers. Our principal reagent suppliers include Bio-Techne Corporation, Selleck Chemicals, Sigma-Aldrich, and VWR International. Our principal instrument suppliers include Acea Biosciences, Integra Biosciences, Invitrogen, and Thermo Fisher Scientific. These items are purchased on a purchase order basis pursuant to the applicable supplier’s standard terms and conditions. The items purchased from these suppliers are standard products sold widely to the biotechnology industry. All items purchased are typically available within several days after an order is placed.

Government Regulation
 
CLIA and CMS
 
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, regulates all clinical laboratory testing (except research) performed on humans in the U.S. through CLIA. All clinical laboratories that perform clinical lab services on human specimens for the purpose of providing information on the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease must receive CLIA certification. This covers approximately 175,000 laboratories as of 2017. Laboratories must obtain CLIA certification and demonstrate compliance with CLIA requirements as confirmed by an inspection by CMS. We received our CLIA certification in 2016. We also had our laboratory certified by the College of American Pathologies, or CAP, in 2016, an organization recognized by CMS as a third-party reviewer of clinical laboratories. Several states, including, among others, New York and California, require licensure of out-of-state labs that receive specimens from the state and compliance with the state’s individual laboratory regulations.
 
If our laboratory is out of compliance with CLIA requirements, we may be subject to sanctions such as suspension, limitation or revocation of our CLIA certificate, as well as directed plan of correction, state on-site monitoring, civil money penalties, civil injunctive suit or criminal penalties. We must maintain CLIA compliance and certification to be eligible to bill for services provided to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. If we were to be found out of compliance with CLIA program requirements and subjected to sanction, our business could be harmed. Failure to comply with state licensure laws, if applicable, could subject us to additional sanctions imposed by state licensing authorities.
 
FDA
 
FDA approval or clearance is not currently required for CELx tests offered as a stand-alone laboratory developed test. If we are partnered with a drug company to launch a CELx test as a CDx for a new drug indication, we would be required to obtain a Pre-Market Approval, or PMA, in conjunction with the pharmaceutical company seeking a New Drug Approval for the matching therapy. Historically, the FDA has exercised enforcement discretion with respect to tests performed solely in a central laboratory, like the CELx tests, often referred to as Laboratory Developed Tests, or LDTs. The FDA has not required laboratories that furnish only LDTs to comply with the agency’s requirements for medical devices (e.g., establishment registration, device listing, quality systems regulations, pre-market clearance or pre-market approval, and post-market controls).
 
Although the FDA proposed regulations that would apply to LDTs, FDA recently decided that, at present, those regulations are not moving forward towards approval and implementation. In mid-2014, the FDA published a Draft Guidance Document describing a proposed approach for a regulatory framework for LDTs that would have resulted in most of the high-value LDT tests marketed today eventually being required to obtain 510(k) clearances or Pre-Market Approvals. If implemented, this regulatory framework would require most hospital clinical labs to abandon a number of tests it performs or to pursue regulatory clearances or approvals to perform them. These proposals met significant resistance from Congress, the hospital industry, and independent clinical laboratories. The FDA indicated in late 2016 that it does not intend to finalize the 2014 Draft Guidance Document at this time. However, FDA continues to discuss potential regulatory approaches to LDTs.
 
HIPAA and HITECH
 
Under the administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, issued regulations that establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by healthcare providers and other covered entities. HIPAA includes the following primary sets of regulations: privacy regulations, security regulations, and standards for electronic transactions, which establish standards for certain healthcare transactions. The privacy and security regulations were extensively amended in 2013 to incorporate new requirements from the HITECH Act.
 
The privacy regulations cover the use and disclosure of protected health information by healthcare providers and other covered entities. They also set forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her protected health information, including, but not limited to, the right to access or amend certain records containing protected health information, or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of protected health information. The security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. The HITECH Act, among other things, makes many of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards applicable to business associates of covered entities, and established certain protected health information security breach notification requirements. A covered entity must notify affected individual(s) and the HHS when there is a breach of unsecured protected health information. HIPAA also governs patient access to laboratory test reports. Effective October 6, 2014, individuals (or their personal representatives, as applicable), have the right to access test reports directly from clinical laboratories and to direct that copies of those test reports be transmitted to persons or entities designated by the individual.

These laws impose significant fines and other penalties for improper use or disclosure of protected health information. Additionally, to the extent that we submit electronic healthcare claims and payment transactions that do not comply with the electronic data transmission standards established under HIPAA and the HITECH Act, payments to us may be delayed or denied.
 
In addition to the federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information and personal data that are applicable to our operations. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a uniform federal “floor” that covered entities and business associates must meet and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing protected health information. The compliance requirements of these various state laws, including additional breach reporting requirements, and the penalties for violation vary widely and new privacy and security laws in this area are evolving. We believe that we have taken the steps required for us to comply with health information privacy and security statutes and regulations in all jurisdictions, both state and federal. However, we may not be able to maintain compliance in all jurisdictions where we do business. Failure to maintain compliance, or changes in state or federal laws regarding privacy or security, could result in civil and/or criminal penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws
 In the United States, there are various fraud and abuse laws with which we must comply and we are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities, including CMS, other divisions of the HHS (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. We also may be subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws in connection with our international business activities.
 
In the United States, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for patient referrals for, or purchasing, leasing, ordering, recommending or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of, any healthcare item or service reimbursable under a governmental payor program. Courts have stated that a financial arrangement may violate the Anti-Kickback Statute if any one purpose of the arrangement is to encourage patient referrals or other federal healthcare program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, consulting fees, waivers of co-payments, ownership interests, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, the HHS issued a series of regulatory “safe harbors.” These safe harbor regulations set forth certain provisions, which, if met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with these provisions protects against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. Many states also have anti-kickback statutes, some of which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
 
In addition, federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses. The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act, although many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a governmental payor program. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal or state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 
In Europe, various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines, for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offence. Violations of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the Bribery Act 2010, which went into effect in July 2011, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act 2010. Under the new regime, an individual found in violation of the Bribery Act 2010 faces imprisonment of up to 10 years. In addition, the individual can be subject to an unlimited fine, as can commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery.
 
Federal and State Physician Self-Referral Prohibitions
 
Under a federal law directed at “self-referral,” commonly known as the “Stark Law,” there are prohibitions, with certain exceptions, on referrals for certain designated health services, including laboratory services, that are covered by the Medicare and Medicaid programs by physicians who personally, or through a family member, have an investment or ownership interest in, or a compensation arrangement with, an entity performing the tests. The prohibition also extends to payment for any testing referred in violation of the Stark Law. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s referral prohibition may be fined up to $100,000 for each such arrangement or scheme. In addition, any person who presents or causes to be presented a claim to the Medicare or Medicaid programs in violation of the Stark Law is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per bill submission, an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed and possible exclusion from participation in federal governmental payor programs. Bills submitted in violation of the Stark Law may not be paid by Medicare or Medicaid, and any person collecting any amounts with respect to any such prohibited bill is obligated to refund such amounts. Many states have comparable laws that are not limited to Medicare and Medicaid referrals.
Other Regulatory Requirements
 
Our operations do not currently use hazardous materials, but we do generate regulated medical waste in the normal course of performing our CELx tests. This subjects us to a variety of federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Some of the regulations under the current regulatory structure provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our, or others’, business operations should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. We cannot predict how changes in laws or development of new regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance.
New Legislation and Regulations
 
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products that are or will be regulated by the FDA or CMS. In addition to new legislation, CMS and FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agencies in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or FDA or CMS regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. The 2016 presidential election and change in administration make it even more difficult to predict if and how federal regulations may change and/or federal agencies might alter their positions.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we sell. Sales of any of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers, managed care organizations or pharmaceutical companies. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a test sometimes is separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that a payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific testing products on an approved list, which might not include all of the tests available for a particular indication.

In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the test. Whether or not we conduct such studies, our products may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a test does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the product. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to enable us to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of tests and drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of testing products, drug products and medical services and questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available tests, they may not cover our products or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls and restrictions on reimbursement. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for testing products or drugs that require use of our testing products and could adversely affect our net revenue and results.
 
Pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular test to currently available tests. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and testing products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for testing products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
 
Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and test pricing regulation may change at any time. In particular, in the United States, the Affordable Care Act contains provisions that have the potential to substantially change healthcare delivery and financing, including impacting the profitability of testing and drugs. For example, the Affordable Care Act revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers for covered outpatient drugs are calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of covered drugs dispensed to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations and subjected manufacturers to new annual fees for certain branded prescription drugs. As the price of our test may be included in the reimbursement rates for certain drugs, this could significantly impact our pricing. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. However, the proposed repeal of the Affordable Care Act and the uncertainty surrounding a potential replacement law make it even more difficult to predict the future for reimbursement and pricing of drugs and tests in the United States.
 
Corporate History
 
We were organized as a Minnesota limited liability company in 2011 and commenced operations in 2012. On September 15, 2017, we converted from a Minnesota limited liability company into a Delaware corporation and changed our name from Celcuity LLC to Celcuity Inc.
Employees and Labor Relations
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 26 employees, each of which were full-time employees. None of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
