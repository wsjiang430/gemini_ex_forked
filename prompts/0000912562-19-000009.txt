Item 1. | Business

The Company
Gibraltar Industries, Inc. (the "Company") is a leading manufacturer and distributor of building products for residential, industrial, infrastructure, renewable energy and conservation markets. Our business strategy focuses on significantly elevating and accelerating the growth and financial returns of the Company. We strive to deliver best-in-class, sustainable value creation for our shareholders for the long-term. We believe this can be achieved from a transformational change in the Company’s portfolio and its financial results. Our business strategy has four key elements, or "pillars," which are: operational excellence, product innovation, portfolio management, and acquisitions as a strategic accelerator.
Operational excellence is our first pillar in this strategy. We focus on reducing complexity, adjusting costs and simplifying our product offering through 80/20 initiatives (“80/20”). 80/20 is the practice of focusing on our largest and best opportunities (the “80”) and eliminating complexity associated with less profitable opportunities (the “20”). The execution of 80/20 across our businesses, along with in-lining and market rate of demand replenishment initiatives, and outsourcing initiatives for our lower volume products provided to our customers to provide the appropriate value proposition, has and will continue to improve our profitability, investment in inventory and fixed assets, and our service levels to customers. 
Product innovation is our second strategic pillar. Innovation is centered on the allocation of new and existing resources to opportunities that we believe will produce sustainable returns. Our focus is on driving top line growth with new and innovative products. We are focused on those products and technologies that have relevance to the end-user and can be differentiated from our competition. Our trade focus initiatives are tailored toward reallocating sales and new product development talent to target specific end user groups in order to better understand their needs and the various market opportunities that may be available. This effort is expected to produce ideas and opportunities that generate profitable growth. Our focus on innovation is centered on our current end markets, including, postal and parcel products, residential air management, infrastructure, renewable energy and conservation. These respective markets are expected to grow based on demand for: centralized mail and parcel delivery systems, including solutions for the last 
3

mile of delivery; zero carbon footprint homes; energy sources not dependent on fossil fuels, and the growing demand for locally grown produce.
The third pillar of our strategy is portfolio management, which is a natural adjunct to the 80/20 initiative. Using the 80/20 process, we conduct strategic reviews of our customers and end markets, and allocate leadership time, capital and resources to the highest-potential platforms and businesses. As a result, we have sold and divested businesses and product lines which have helped contribute to the Company's realization of a higher rate of return on invested capital. We view portfolio management as a continuous process that will remain an important part of our strategy as we look to improve Gibraltar's long-term financial performance. 
The fourth pillar of our strategy is acquisitions. We have targeted four key markets in which to make strategic acquisitions which are served by existing platforms within the Company. The target markets include: postal, parcel and storage solutions; infrastructure; residential air management; and renewable energy and conservation. These platforms are all in large markets in which the underlying trends for customer convenience and safety, energy-savings and resource conservation are of increasing importance and are expected to drive long-term demand. We believe these markets also offer the opportunity for higher returns on our investments than those we have generated in the past. The acquisitions of Rough Brothers Manufacturing, Inc., RBI Solar, Inc., and affiliates, collectively known as "RBI" in June 2015, Nexus Corporation ("Nexus") in October 2016, Package Concierge in February 2017, and most recently, SolarBOS in August 2018, were the direct result of this fourth pillar strategy. We also consider businesses outside of these four markets, as we continually search out opportunities to grow our business in large markets with expected growth in demand for the foreseeable future, where we can add value through our manufacturing expertise, 80/20 process and purchasing synergies.
The Company serves customers primarily throughout North America. Our customers include major home improvement retailers, wholesalers, industrial distributors, contractors, solar developers and institutional and commercial growers of plants. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 40 facilities, comprised of 30 manufacturing facilities, five distribution centers, and five offices, which are located in 18 states, Canada, China, and Japan. These facilities give us a base of operations to provide customer support, delivery, service and quality to a number of regional and national customers and providing us with manufacturing and distribution efficiencies in North America, as well as a presence in the Asian markets.
The Company operates and reports its results in the following three reporting segments: 

• | Residential Products;


• | Industrial and Infrastructure Products; and


• | Renewable Energy and Conservation

The following table sets forth the primary products, applications, and end markets for each segment:
Residential Products Segment

We believe our operating segments have established reputations as industry leaders with respect to quality, service and innovation and have achieved strong competitive positions in our markets. We attribute their competitive standing in the markets primarily to the following strengths:
Leading market share. We have a leading market position in many of the products and services we offer, and we estimate that a majority of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were derived from the sale of products in which we had one of the leading U.S. market shares. We believe we have leading market shares in five distinct product families: roof-related ventilation; postal and parcel storage; structural bearings and expansion joints for bridges and other structures; institutional and retail greenhouses; and fixed-tilt ground mount racking for photovoltaic (PV) solar systems.
Provider of value-added products and related services. We increasingly focus on providing innovative value-added products and related services, such as centralized mail systems and electronic package solutions, expansion joints and structural bearings for roadways and bridges, roof and foundation ventilation products, solar racking systems, and greenhouses which can solve end customer needs while also helping to improve our margins and profitability. Our products use complex and demanding production and treatment processes that require advanced production equipment, sophisticated technology and exacting quality control measures, along with specialized design and engineering skills. We also focus our acquisition strategy on manufacturers offering engineered products and services in key growth markets.
Commitment to quality. Gibraltar’s quality management systems are designed to ensure that we meet the needs and desired level of excellence, of our customers and other stakeholders, while meeting statutory and regulatory requirements related to our products or services. Our policies, processes and procedures required for planning and execution, are based on the principles of: customer focus, leadership, engagement of people, process approach, improvement, evidence-based decision-making and relationship management. 
Strong liquidity profile. We strive to manage our cash resources to ensure we have sufficient liquidity to support the seasonality of our businesses, potential downturns in economic activity, and to fund growth initiatives. During 2017 and 2018, we purchased Package Concierge for approximately $19 million and SolarBOS for approximately $6 million, respectively, both of which were funded by our cash on hand. Our liquidity as of December 31, 2018 was $588 million, 
5

including $297 million of cash and $291 million of availability under our then existing revolving credit facility. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we redeemed all $210 million of our 6.25% Senior Subordinated Notes with existing cash on hand and refinanced our Senior Credit Agreement as further described below. We believe that our resulting low leverage and increased borrowing capacity along with enhanced flexibility in our new Senior Credit Agreement, provide us with ample liquidity which allows us to support our strategic initiatives, successfully manage our business, meet the demands of our customers, weather the cyclicality of certain end markets and take advantage of growth opportunities. 
Recent developments
On January 2, 2019, the Company appointed William T. Bosway as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and a member of the Board of Directors. Over the past 29 years, Mr. Bosway has worked for two Fortune 500 industrial companies and brings to the Company strong leadership skills and significant experience in acquisitions, driving organic growth, lean manufacturing and continuous improvement techniques.
On January 24, 2019, we entered into the Company's Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Senior Credit Agreement") which includes a 5-year, $400 million revolving credit facility. The Senior Credit Agreement also provides the Company the opportunity, upon request, to increase the amount of the revolving credit facility to $700 million. In conjunction with entering into the Senior Credit Agreement on February 1, 2019, the Company redeemed all $210 million of its outstanding 6.25% Senior Subordinated Bonds. The amended Senior Credit Agreement provides the Company with access to capital and improves our financial flexibility. 
On August 21, 2018, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of SolarBOS for approximately $6 million subject to a working capital adjustment and certain other adjustments provided for in the stock purchase agreement. SolarBOS is a provider of electrical balance of systems products, which consists of electrical components such as wiring, switches, and combiner boxes that support photovoltaic systems, for the U.S. solar renewable energy market. The results of operations of SolarBOS have been included in the Renewable Energy and Conservation segment of the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
On February 22, 2017, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Package Concierge for $19 million. Package Concierge is a leading provider of multifamily electronic package delivery locker systems in the United States. The results of operations of Package Concierge have been included within the Company's Residential Products segment of the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
On December 2, 2016, as part of its portfolio management initiative, the Company announced its intentions to exit its U.S. bar grating product line and its European residential solar racking business, within the Company’s Industrial and Infrastructure Products, and Renewable Energy and Conservation, segments, respectively. On February 6, 2017, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of its U.S. bar grating product line assets to a third party. In addition, the Company discontinued the operations of its European residential solar racking business during the first quarter of 2017. These businesses contributed a combined $75 million in revenue and pre-tax operating losses of $6 million in 2016. This initiative resulted in the sale and closing of 3 facilities in 2017.
On October 11, 2016, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Nexus for $24 million. The acquisition was financed through cash on hand. Nexus is a leading provider of commercial-scale greenhouses to customers in the United States. The results of operations of Nexus have been included within the Renewable Energy and Conservation segment of the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
On April 15, 2016, the Company sold its European industrial manufacturing business to a third party for net of cash proceeds of $8 million. This business, which supplied expanded metal products for filtration and other applications, contributed $36 million in revenue to the Company's Industrial & Infrastructure Products segment in 2015 and had nearly break-even operating results. The divestiture of this business was based on and is consistent with the Company's ongoing portfolio management assessments.

We maintain our equipment according to a thorough preventive maintenance program allowing us to meet the demanding quality and delivery requirements of our customers. In some cases, the Company sources products from third-party vendors to optimize cost and quality in order to provide the very best and affordable solution for our customers.
Industrial and Infrastructure Products
Our Industrial and Infrastructure Products segment serves a variety of end markets such as industrial and commercial construction, highway and bridge construction, automotive, airports and energy and power generation through a number of sales channels including discrete and process manufacturers, steel fabricators and distributors, commercial and transportation contractors, and power generating utilities. Our Industrial and Infrastructure product offerings include perimeter security, expanded and perforated metal, plank grating, as well as, expansion joints and structural bearings for roadways and bridges. We operate 10 manufacturing facilities and 3 distribution centers throughout the United States and Canada giving us a base of operations to provide customer support, delivery, service, and quality to a number of regional and national customers, and provide us with manufacturing and distribution efficiencies in North America. 
Our expanded and perforated metal and plank grating is used in walkways, catwalks, architectural facades, perimeter security barriers, shelving, and other applications where both visibility and security are necessary. Our fiberglass grating is used by our customers where high strength, light weight, low maintenance, corrosion resistance and non-conductivity are required. Our remaining product offerings in this segment include expansion joint systems, bearing assemblies, and pavement sealing systems used in bridges, elevated highways, airport runways, and rail crossings.
We strive to improve our offerings of industrial and infrastructure products by introducing new products, enhancing existing products, adjusting product specifications to respond to commercial building code and regulatory changes, and providing additional solutions to original equipment manufacturers and contractors. New products introduced in recent years include customized perforated and expanded metal to penetrate a range of new markets such as architectural facades for buildings (museums, sports stadiums and retail outlets) and perimeter security barriers for protecting critical infrastructure. In addition, we have extended our transportation infrastructure products into new 
7

markets. For example, our long-lasting pavement sealants for roadways are now being installed on airport runways, our structural bearings for elevated highways and bridges have been installed on an offshore oil production platform, and our corrosion-protection products for cable-suspension bridges are now marketed and sold internationally.
Our production capabilities allow us to process a wide range of metals necessary for manufacturing industrial products. Most of our production is completed using computer numerical control ("CNC") machines, shears, slitters, press brakes, milling, welding, and numerous automated assembly machines. We maintain our equipment according to a thorough preventive maintenance program, including in-house tool and die shops, allowing us to meet the demanding service requirements of many of our customers.
Renewable Energy and Conservation
The Renewable Energy and Conservation segment is primarily a designer and manufacturer of fully-engineered solutions for solar mounting systems and greenhouse structures. This segment offers a fully integrated approach to the design, engineering, manufacturing and installation of solar racking systems, including electrical balance of systems, and commercial, institutional, and retail greenhouse structures servicing customers, such as solar owners and developers, retail garden centers, conservatories and botanical gardens, commercial growers, and schools and universities. We have 8 manufacturing facilities and 2 distribution centers and operate in the United States, China and Japan.
An integral part of each customer project is the fabrication of specifically designed metal structures for highly-engineered applications including: racking for ground-mounted solar arrays; single-axis solar tracker solutions; carports that integrate solar PV panels; as well as commercial-scale greenhouses and other glass structures. Both the solar racking and greenhouse projects involve holding glass and plastic to metal and use the same raw materials including steel and aluminum. Most of our production is completed using CNC machines, roll forming machines, laser cutters and other fabrication tools. The structural metal components are designed, engineered, fabricated and installed in accordance with applicable building codes.
We strive to improve our offerings of products by introducing new products, enhancing existing products, adjusting product specifications to respond to commercial building codes and regulatory changes, and providing solutions to contractors and end users. New products introduced in recent years include single-axis tracker systems, metal framed structures for car washes, and solar racking systems for carports and canopies. Our single-axis tracker systems within our within our solar mounting solutions group, provide flexibility to adapt to a variety of site conditions that impact tracker site designs when using other solutions in the market and can vastly reduce the costs associated with civil work on projects. The patented design eliminates complexities incorporated in the traditional systems, thus simplifying the operations and maintenance of the system, along with streamlining the installation process. Our car washes serve a market preference for light- transparent structures. Solar racking systems for carports serve as protection for cars from the effects of the sun and intense heat while providing a renewable energy resource. Similarly, solar racking systems installed on idle land, such as solid waste landfills, converts such land into a useful property by providing power generating capabilities.
Engineering and Technical Services
Our business segments employ engineers and other technical personnel to perform a variety of key tasks. These personnel staff fully-equipped, modern laboratories to support our operations. These laboratories enable us to verify, analyze, and document the physical, chemical, metallurgical, and mechanical properties of our raw materials and products. In addition, our engineering staff employs a range of drafting software to design highly specialized and technically precise products. In our Industrial and Infrastructure Products and Renewable Energy and Conservation segments, drawings are signed and sealed by licensed engineers. Technical service personnel also work in conjunction with our sales force in the new product development process to determine the types of products and services that suit the particular needs of our customers.
Suppliers and Raw Materials
Our business is required to maintain sufficient quantities of raw material inventory in order to accommodate our customers’ short lead times. Accordingly, we plan our purchases to maintain raw materials at sufficient levels to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers. We have implemented enterprise resource planning systems to better manage our inventory, forecast customer orders, enable efficient supply chain management, and allow for more timely counter-measures to changing customer demand and market conditions.

The primary raw materials we purchase are flat-rolled and plate steel, aluminum, and resins. We purchase flat-rolled and plate steel and aluminum at regular intervals on an as-needed basis, primarily from the major North American mills, as well as, a limited amount from domestic service centers and foreign steel importers. Substantially all of our resins are purchased from domestic vendors, primarily through distributors, with a small amount purchased directly from manufacturers. Supply has historically been adequate from these sources to fulfill our needs. Because of our strategy to develop longstanding relationships in our supply chain, we have been able to adjust our deliveries of raw materials to match our required inventory positions to support our on-time deliveries to customers while allowing us to manage our investment in inventory and working capital. Management continually examines and improves our purchasing practices across our geographically dispersed facilities in order to streamline purchasing across similar commodities.
We purchase natural gas and electricity from suppliers in proximity to our operations.
Intellectual Property
We actively protect our proprietary rights by the use of trademark, copyright, and patent registrations. While we do not believe that any individual item of our intellectual property is material, we believe our trademarks, copyrights, and patents provide us with a competitive advantage when marketing our products to customers. We also believe our brands are well recognized in the markets we serve and we believe they stand for high-quality manufactured goods at a competitive price. These trademarks, copyrights, and patent registrations allow us to help maintain product leadership positions for the goods we offer. In 2018, 11% of our annual revenues were generated from patented products.
Sales and Marketing
Our products and services are sold primarily by channel partners who are called on by our sales personnel and outside sales representatives located throughout North America. We have organized sales teams to focus on specific customers and national accounts through which we provide enhanced supply solutions and improve our ability to increase the number of products that we sell. Our sales staff works with certain retail customers to optimize shelf space for our products which is expected to increase sales at these locations. Our sales regularly involve competitive bidding processes, and our reputation for meeting delivery time lines and strict specifications make us a preferred provider for many customers.
We focus on providing our customers with industry leading customer service. Our retail customers are provided with point-of-sale marketing aids to encourage consumer spending on our products in their stores. Continual communication with our customers allows us to understand their concerns and provides us with the opportunity to identify solutions that will meet their needs. We are able to meet our customers’ demand requirements due to our efficient manufacturing processes and extensive distribution network.
Backlog
While the majority of our products have short lead time order cycles, we have aggregated approximately $161 million of backlog at December 31, 2018. The backlog primarily relates to certain business units in our Industrial and Infrastructure Products and our Renewable Energy and Conservation segments. We believe that the majority of our backlog will be shipped, completed and installed during 2019.
Competition
The Company operates in highly competitive markets. We compete against several competitors in all three of our segments with different competitors in each major product category. We compete with competitors based on the range of products offered, quality, price, and delivery, as well as, serving as a full service provider for project management in certain segments. Although some of our competitors are large companies, the majority are small to medium-sized and do not offer the large range of building products that we offer.
We believe our broad range of products, high quality, and sustained ability to meet exacting customer delivery requirements gives us a competitive advantage over many of our competitors. We also believe that execution of our business strategy further differentiates us from many of our competitors and allows us to capitalize on those areas that give us a competitive advantage over many of our competitors.

Seasonality
The Company’s business has historically been subjected to seasonal influences, with higher sales typically realized in the second and third quarters. General economic forces, such as tax credit expirations and imposed tariffs, along with changes in the Company’s customer mix have shifted traditional seasonal fluctuations in revenue over the past few years.
Governmental Regulation
Our production processes involve the use of environmentally regulated materials. We believe that we operate our business in material compliance with all federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, and do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations to maintain compliance with such laws and regulations. However, we could incur operating costs or capital expenditures in complying with new or more stringent environmental requirements in the future or with current requirements if they are applied to our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers in a way we do not anticipate. In addition, new or more stringent regulation of our energy suppliers could cause them to increase the price of energy.
Our operations are also governed by many other laws and regulations covering our labor relationships, the import and export of goods, the zoning of our facilities, taxes, our general business practices, and other matters. We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations and do not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
