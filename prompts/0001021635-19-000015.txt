Item 1. Business.
The Company

Introduction

The Company, incorporated in August 1995 in the State of Oklahoma, is a holding company with investments in energy and energy services providers offering physical delivery and related services for both electricity and natural gas primarily in the south central U.S. The Company conducts these activities through two business segments: (i) electric utility and (ii) natural gas midstream operations. 

The electric utility segment generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy in Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Its operations are conducted through OG&E and are subject to regulation by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC. OG&E was incorporated in 1902 under the laws of the Oklahoma Territory and is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. OG&E is the largest electric utility in Oklahoma, and its franchised service territory includes Fort Smith, Arkansas and the surrounding communities. OG&E sold its retail natural gas business in 1928 and is no longer engaged in the natural gas distribution business. 
The natural gas midstream operations segment represents the Company's investment in Enable through wholly owned subsidiaries and ultimately OGE Holdings. Enable was formed in 2013 and is primarily engaged in the business of gathering, processing, transporting and storing natural gas. Enable's natural gas gathering and processing assets are strategically located in four states and serve natural gas production from shale developments in the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex Basins. Enable also owns a crude oil gathering business in the Anadarko and Williston Basins. Enable has intrastate natural gas transportation and storage assets that are located in Oklahoma as well as interstate assets that extend from western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle to Louisiana, from Louisiana to Illinois and from Louisiana to Alabama. At December 31, 2018, the Company owned 111.0 million common units, or 25.6 percent, of Enable's outstanding common units.
The Company's principal executive offices are located at 321 North Harvey, P.O. Box 321, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73101-0321 (telephone 405-553-3000). At December 31, 2018, the Company had 2,292 employees, of which 90 are seconded to Enable. The Company's website address is www.ogeenergy.com. Through the Company's website under the heading "Investors," "SEC Filings," the Company makes available, free of charge, its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company's website and the information contained therein or connected thereto are not intended to be incorporated into this Form 10-K and should not be considered a part of this Form 10-K. Reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission are also made available on its website at www.sec.gov.
Company Strategy

The Company's mission, through OG&E and the Company's equity interest in Enable, is to fulfill its critical role in the nation's electric utility and natural gas midstream pipeline infrastructure and meet individual customer's needs for energy and related services, focusing on safety, efficiency, reliability, customer service and risk management. The Company's corporate strategy is to continue to maintain its existing business mix and diversified asset position of its regulated electric utility business and interest in a publicly traded midstream company, while providing competitive energy products and services to customers, as well as seeking growth opportunities in both businesses.
OG&E is focused on:

• | providing exceptional customer experiences by continuing to improve customer interfaces, tools, products and services that deliver high customer satisfaction and operating productivity;


• | providing safe, reliable energy to the communities and customers we serve, with a particular focus on enhancing the value of the grid by improving distribution grid reliability by reducing the frequency and duration of customer interruptions and leveraging previous grid technology investments;


• | having strong regulatory and legislative relationships for the long-term benefit of our customers, investors and members;


• | continuing to grow a zero-injury culture and deliver top-quartile safety results;

 2


• | ensuring we have the necessary mix of generation resources to meet the long-term needs of our customers; and


• | continuing focus on operational excellence and efficiencies in order to protect the customer bill.

Additionally, the Company wants to achieve a premium valuation of its businesses relative to its peers, grow earnings per share with a stable earnings pattern, create a high performance culture and achieve desired outcomes with target stakeholders. The Company's financial objectives include a long-term annual earnings growth rate for OG&E of four to six percent on a weather-normalized basis, maintaining a strong credit rating as well as targeting dividend increases of approximately 10 percent annually through 2019. The Company also utilizes cash distributions from its investment in Enable to help fund its capital needs and support future dividend growth. The Company believes it can accomplish these financial objectives by, among other things, pursuing multiple avenues to build its business, maintaining a diversified asset position, continuing to develop a wide range of skills to succeed with changes in its industries, providing products and services to customers efficiently, managing risks effectively and having strong regulatory and legislative relationships.

Electric Operations - OG&E
General
The electric utility segment generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy in Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Its operations are conducted through OG&E. OG&E furnishes retail electric service in 267 communities and their contiguous rural and suburban areas. The service area covers 30,000 square miles in Oklahoma and western Arkansas, including Oklahoma City, the largest city in Oklahoma, and Fort Smith, Arkansas, the second largest city in that state. Of the 267 communities that OG&E serves, 241 are located in Oklahoma, and 26 are in Arkansas. OG&E derived 92 percent of its total electric operating revenues in 2018 from sales in Oklahoma and the remainder from sales in Arkansas. OG&E does not currently serve wholesale customers in either state.
OG&E's system control area peak demand in 2018 was 6,863 MWs on July 20, 2018. OG&E's load responsibility peak demand was 6,094 MWs on July 20, 2018. The following table shows system sales and variations in system sales for 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Year Ended December 31 | 2018 | 2018 vs. 2017 | 2017 | 2017 vs. 2016 | 2016
System sales - (Millions of MWh) | 28.1 | 6.8% | 26.3 | (2.2)% | 26.9

OG&E is subject to competition in various degrees from government-owned electric systems, municipally-owned electric systems, rural electric cooperatives and, in certain respects, from other private utilities, power marketers and cogenerators. Oklahoma law forbids the granting of an exclusive franchise to a utility for providing electricity.
Besides competition from other suppliers or marketers of electricity, OG&E competes with suppliers of other forms of energy. The degree of competition between suppliers may vary depending on relative costs and supplies of other forms of energy. It is possible that changes in regulatory policies or advances in technologies such as fuel cells, microturbines, windmills and photovoltaic solar cells will reduce costs of new technology to levels that are equal to or below that of most central station electricity production. Our ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations is a significant determinant of our competitiveness.

Regulation and Rates
OG&E's retail electric tariffs are regulated by the OCC in Oklahoma and by the APSC in Arkansas. The issuance of certain securities by OG&E is also regulated by the OCC and the APSC. OG&E's transmission activities, short-term borrowing authorization and accounting practices are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. The Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy has jurisdiction over some of OG&E's facilities and operations. In 2018, 86 percent of OG&E's electric revenue was subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC, eight percent to the APSC and six percent to the FERC.
The OCC issued an order in 1996 authorizing OG&E to reorganize into a subsidiary of the Company. The order required that, among other things, (i) the Company permit the OCC access to the books and records of the Company and its affiliates relating to transactions with OG&E; (ii) the Company employ accounting and other procedures and controls to protect against subsidization of non-utility activities by OG&E's customers; and (iii) the Company refrain from pledging OG&E assets or income for affiliate transactions. In addition, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 enacted the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, which in turn granted to the FERC access to the books and records of the Company and its affiliates as the FERC deems relevant to costs incurred by OG&E or necessary or appropriate for the protection of utility customers with respect to the FERC jurisdictional rates. 
For information concerning OG&E's recently completed and currently pending regulatory proceedings, see Note 15 in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
OG&E, as a regulated utility, is subject to accounting principles for certain types of rate-regulated activities, which provide that certain incurred costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets, based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates. Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates. Management's expected recovery of deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment.
OG&E records certain incurred costs and obligations as regulatory assets or liabilities if, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence, it is probable that the costs or obligations will be included in amounts allowable for recovery or refund in future rates. Management continuously monitors the future recoverability of regulatory assets. When in management's judgment future recovery becomes impaired, the amount of the regulatory asset is adjusted, as appropriate. If OG&E were required to discontinue the application of accounting principles for certain types of rate-regulated activities for some or all of its operations, it could result in writing off the related regulatory assets or liabilities, which could have significant financial effects. See Note 1 in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of OG&E's regulatory assets and liabilities.
Rate Structures
Oklahoma
OG&E's standard tariff rates include a cost of service component (including an authorized return on capital) plus a fuel adjustment clause mechanism that allows OG&E to pass through to customers the actual cost of fuel and purchased power.
OG&E offers several alternative customer programs and rate options, as described below.

• | Under OG&E's Smart Grid-enabled SmartHours programs, "time-of-use" and "variable peak pricing" rates offer customers the ability to save on their electricity bills by shifting some of the electricity consumption to off-peak times when demand for electricity and costs are at their lowest.


• | The guaranteed flat bill option for residential and small general service accounts allows qualifying customers the opportunity to purchase their electricity needs at a set monthly price for an entire year.


• | The Renewable Energy Credit purchase program, a rate option that provides a "renewable energy" resource, is available as a voluntary option to all of OG&E's Oklahoma retail customers. OG&E's ownership and access to wind and solar resources makes the renewable option a possible choice in meeting the renewable energy needs of our conservation-minded customers.


• | Load Reduction is a voluntary load curtailment program that provides OG&E's commercial and industrial customers with the opportunity to curtail usage on a voluntary basis when OG&E's system conditions merit curtailment action. Customers that curtail their usage will receive payment for their curtailment response. This voluntary curtailment program seeks customers that can curtail on most curtailment event days but may not be able to curtail every time that a curtailment event is required.

 5


• | OG&E offers certain qualifying customers "day-ahead price" and "flex price" rate options which allow participating customers to adjust their electricity consumption based on price signals received from OG&E. The prices for the "day-ahead price" and "flex price" rate options are based on OG&E's projected next day hourly operating costs.

OG&E has Public Schools-Demand and Public Schools Non-Demand rate classes that provide OG&E with flexibility to provide targeted programs for load management to public schools and their unique usage patterns. OG&E also provides service level, seasonal and time period fuel charge differentiation that allows customers to pay fuel costs that better reflect the underlying costs of providing electric service. Lastly, OG&E has a military base rider that demonstrates Oklahoma's continued commitment to our military partners.
The previously discussed rate options, coupled with OG&E's other rate choices, provide many tariff options for OG&E's Oklahoma retail customers. The revenue impacts associated with these options are not determinable in future years because customers may choose to remain on existing rate options instead of volunteering for the alternative rate option choices. Revenue variations may occur in the future based upon changes in customers' usage characteristics if they choose alternative rate options.
Arkansas
OG&E's standard tariff rates include a cost of service component (including an authorized return on capital) plus an energy cost recovery mechanism that allows OG&E to pass through to customers the actual cost of fuel and purchased power. In May 2017, the APSC approved a settlement requiring OG&E to be regulated under a formula rate rider. The formula rate rider provides for an annual adjustment to rates approved by the APSC in the May 2017 settlement if the earned rate of return falls outside of a plus or minus 50 basis point dead-band around the allowed return on equity. Adjustments are limited to plus or minus four percent of revenue for each rate class for the 12 months preceding the projected year. The initial term for the formula rate rider is not to exceed five years, unless additional approval is obtained from the APSC. 
OG&E offers several alternative customer programs and rate options, as described below.

• | The "time-of-use" and "variable peak pricing" tariffs allow participating customers to save on their electricity bills by shifting some of the electricity consumption to off-peak times when demand for electricity is lowest.


• | The Renewable Energy Credit purchase program, a tariff rate option that provides a "renewable energy" resource, is available as a voluntary option to all of OG&E's Arkansas retail customers. OG&E's ownership and access to wind resources makes the renewable option a possible choice in meeting the renewable energy needs of our conservation-minded customers.


• | Load Reduction is a voluntary load curtailment program that provides OG&E's commercial and industrial customers with the opportunity to curtail usage on a voluntary basis and receive a billing credit when OG&E's system conditions merit curtailment action.


• | OG&E offers certain qualifying customers a "day-ahead price" rate option which allows participating customers to adjust their electricity consumption based on a price signal received from OG&E. The "day-ahead price" is based on OG&E's projected next day hourly operating costs.

Fuel Supply and Generation
The OG&E-generated energy produced and the weighted average cost of fuel used, by type, for the last three years is presented below.

 | Fuel Mix (A) | Fuel Cost (In cents/Kilowatt-Hour)
Fuel | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 
Natural gas | 48% | 39% | 45% | 2.517 | 2.821 | 2.488
Coal | 45% | 54% | 48% | 2.025 | 2.069 | 2.213
Renewable | 7% | 7% | 7% | — | — | — 
Total fuel | 100% | 100% | 100% | 2.122 | 2.211 | 2.199


(A) | Fuel mix calculated as a percent of net MWhs generated.

The decrease in the weighted average cost of fuel in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to lower natural gas prices. The increase in the weighted average cost of fuel in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher natural gas prices. These fuel costs are recovered through OG&E's fuel adjustment clauses that are approved by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC.

OG&E participates in the SPP Integrated Marketplace. As part of the Integrated Marketplace, the SPP has balancing authority responsibilities for its market participants. The SPP Integrated Marketplace functions as a centralized dispatch, where market participants, including OG&E, submit offers to sell power to the SPP from their resources and bid to purchase power from the SPP for their customers. The SPP Integrated Marketplace is intended to allow the SPP to optimize supply offers and demand bids based upon reliability and economic considerations and to determine which generating units will run at any given time for maximum cost-effectiveness within the SPP area. As a result, OG&E's generating units produce output that is different from OG&E's customer load requirements. Net fuel and purchased power costs are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses.
Of OG&E's 6,616 total MWs of generation capability reflected in the table in "Item 2. Properties," 3,631 MWs, or 54.9 percent, are from natural gas generation, 2,524 MWs, or 38.1 percent, are from coal generation, 449 MWs, or 6.8 percent, are from wind generation and 12 MWs, or 0.2 percent, are from solar generation.
Coal
OG&E's coal-fired units are designed to burn low sulfur western sub-bituminous coal. The combination of all 2018 coal had a weighted average sulfur content of 0.23 percent. Based on the average sulfur content and EPA-certified data, OG&E's coal units have an approximate emission rate of 0.5 lbs. of SO2 per MMBtu.
For the first quarter of 2019, OG&E has purchased 100 percent of its coal requirements. OG&E plans to fill the remainder of its 2019 coal needs through spot purchases and use of existing inventory. OG&E has no coal purchase contracts beyond December 2019. In 2018, OG&E purchased 4.6 million tons of coal from various Wyoming suppliers. See "Environmental Laws and Regulations" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for a discussion of environmental matters which may affect OG&E in the future, including its utilization of coal.
Natural Gas
As a participant in the SPP Integrated Marketplace, OG&E purchases its natural gas supply through short-term agreements. OG&E relies on a combination of natural gas call agreements, whereby OG&E has the right but not the obligation to purchase a defined quantity of natural gas, combined with day and intra-day purchases to meet the demands of the SPP Integrated Marketplace. 
Wind
OG&E owns the 120 MW Centennial, 101 MW OU Spirit and 228 MW Crossroads wind farms. OG&E's current wind power portfolio also includes purchased power contracts as listed in the table below. 

Company | Location | Original Term of Contract | Expiration of Contract | MWs 
CPV Keenan | Woodward County, OK | 20 years | 2030 | 152.0
Edison Mission Energy | Dewey County, OK | 20 years | 2031 | 130.0
NextEra Energy | Blackwell, OK | 20 years | 2032 | 60.0 

Solar
In 2015, OG&E placed its first solar plant into service. The plant consists of two separate solar farms and is located in Oklahoma City on the site of the Mustang generating facility. The Mustang solar plant has a maximum capacity of 2.5 MWs and consists of almost 10,000 photovoltaic panels.
In the first quarter of 2018, OG&E placed its second solar plant, which is located near Covington, Oklahoma, into service. The Covington solar plant has a maximum capacity of 9.7 MWs and consists of almost 38,000 photovoltaic panels.
OG&E will continue to evaluate the need to add solar plants to its generation portfolio based on customer demand, cost and reliability. 
Safety and Health Regulation

OG&E is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including OSHA, the EPA and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the safety and health of workers.
 7

In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, the EPA Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know regulations under Title III of the Federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials stored, used or produced in OG&E's operations and that this information be provided or made available to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. OG&E believes that it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker safety and health.
Natural Gas Midstream Operations - Enable
Overview

Enable is a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership formed to own, operate and develop strategically located natural gas and crude oil infrastructure assets. Enable serves current and emerging production areas in the U.S., including several unconventional shale resource plays and local and regional end-user markets in the U.S. Enable's assets and operations are organized into two reportable segments: (i) gathering and processing and (ii) transportation and storage. Enable's gathering and processing segment primarily provides natural gas gathering and processing to its producer customers and crude oil, condensate and produced water gathering services to its producer and refiner customers. Enable's transportation and storage segment provides interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline transportation and storage services primarily to its producer, power plant, LDC and industrial end-user customers.
Gathering and Processing
Enable owns and operates substantial natural gas gathering and processing and crude oil, condensate and produced water gathering assets in five states. Enable's gathering and processing operations consist primarily of natural gas gathering and processing assets serving the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex Basins, crude oil and condensate gathering assets serving the Anadarko Basin and crude oil and produced water assets serving the Williston Basin. Enable provides a variety of services to the active producers in its operating areas, including gathering, compressing, treating and processing natural gas, fractionating NGLs and gathering crude oil, condensate and produced water.
Enable generates revenues from producers in the basins in which it operates. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Enable's top ten natural gas producer customers accounted for approximately 70 percent of its natural gas gathered volumes. Enable's Anadarko Basin crude oil gathering systems gathers crude oil and condensate from producers, which are primarily delivered to one customer. The rates and terms of service on Enable's Anadarko Basin crude oil and condensate gathering system are regulated by the OCC. Enable's Williston Basin crude oil and produced water gathering systems serve one customer. The rates and terms of service on Enable's Williston Basin crude oil gathering systems, but not its produced water gathering systems, are regulated by the FERC. Enable's contracts typically provide for crude oil, condensate and produced water gathering services that are fee-based and for natural gas gathering and processing arrangements that are fee-based, or percent-of-liquids, percent-of-proceeds or keep-whole based. 
Competition for Enable's gathering and processing systems is primarily a function of gathering rate, processing value, system reliability, fuel rate, system run time, construction cycle time and prices at the wellhead. Enable's gathering and processing systems compete with gatherers and processors of all types and sizes, including those affiliated with various producers, other major pipeline companies and various independent midstream entities. In the process of selling NGLs, Enable competes against other natural gas processors extracting and selling NGLs. Enable's primary competitors are other midstream companies who are active in the regions where Enable operates.
While the results of Enable's gathering and processing segment are not materially affected by seasonality, from time to time, its operations and construction of assets can be impacted by inclement weather.
Transportation and Storage
Enable owns and operates interstate and intrastate natural gas transportation and storage systems across nine states. Enable's transportation and storage systems consist primarily of its interstate systems, EGT and MRT, its intrastate system, EOIT, and its investment in SESH. Enable's transportation and storage assets transport natural gas from areas of production and interconnected pipelines to power plants, LDCs and industrial end users as well as interconnected pipelines for delivery to additional markets. Enable's transportation and storage assets also provide facilities where natural gas can be stored by customers.
Enable's interstate and intrastate natural gas transportation and storage systems generate revenue primarily by serving various LDCs, producers, utilities, power plants and industry end-users. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 28 percent of EGT's service revenue was attributable to contracts with one customer, CenterPoint. All of EGT's firm transportation 
 8

and storage contracts for CenterPoint's LDCs are scheduled to expire in March 2021. CenterPoint's LDCs have initiated proceedings before the state utility commissions in Arkansas and Oklahoma to consider whether contracts extending transportation and storage services with EGT would be more favorable than the expected results of competitive bidding for the same services. If the proposed contracts are approved, then the term for the transportation and storage services provided to CenterPoint's LDCs in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and northeast Texas will be extended beyond March 2021, pursuant to the terms of the approved contracts. 

For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 70 percent of MRT's service revenue was attributable to contracts with one customer, Spire Inc. MRT's firm transportation contracts representing 63 percent of Spire Inc.'s firm transportation capacity are scheduled to expire in July 2019, and 37 percent of Spire Inc.'s firm transportation capacity are scheduled to expire in July 2020. 32 percent of Spire Inc.'s firm storage contracts are scheduled to expire in May 2019, and 68 percent of Spire Inc.'s firm storage contracts are schedule to expire in May 2020. On August 3, 2018, the FERC approved a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the Spire STL Pipeline. The Spire STL Pipeline will be an additional interstate pipeline serving Spire Inc.'s affiliates in the St. Louis, Missouri market. Spire Inc. has indicated that it is targeting a 2019 in-service date for this pipeline. When the pipeline is placed into service, Enable anticipates that Spire Inc.'s LDC's need for firm transportation and storage capacity on MRT will decrease.
Enable's EGT, MRT and SESH transportation and storage services are typically provided under firm, fee-based transportation and storage agreements, with rates and terms of service regulated by the FERC. EOIT provides fee-based firm and interruptible transportation and storage services on both an intrastate and interstate basis.
Enable's interstate and intrastate pipelines compete with a variety of other interstate and intrastate pipelines in providing transportation and storage services within its operating areas. Enable's management views the principal elements of competition among pipelines as rates and terms, flexibility and reliability of service.
Customer demand for natural gas on EGT and MRT is usually greater during the winter, primarily due to LDC demand to serve residential and commercial natural gas requirements. Customer demand for natural gas transportation and storage services on EOIT is usually greater during the summer, primarily due to demand by natural gas-fired power plants to serve residential and commercial electricity requirements, including for OG&E. SESH is generally not impacted by seasonality.
Environmental Matters

General

The activities of the Company are subject to numerous stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection. These laws and regulations can change, restrict or otherwise impact the Company's business activities in many ways, including the handling or disposal of waste material, planning for future construction activities to avoid or mitigate harm to threatened or endangered species and requiring the installation and operation of emissions control equipment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Management believes that all of its operations are in substantial compliance with current federal, state and local environmental standards.

In the past, environmental regulation caused the Company to incur significant costs because the trend was to place more and more restrictions and limitations on the Company's activities. The Trump administration has delayed, reversed or proposed to repeal some of these regulations and generally has not sought to adopt new, more stringent regulations. Nonetheless, the Company continues to have obligations to take or complete action under previously adopted environmental rules, and the Company cannot assure that future events, such as changes in existing laws, the promulgation of new laws or regulations or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause it to incur significant costs for environmental matters.
It is estimated that OG&E's total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for 2019 will be $50.0 million, of which $25.5 million is for capital expenditures. The amounts for OG&E include capital expenditures for the Dry Scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas.
