ITEM 1.   BUSINESS.
History and Corporate Structure

General Cannabis Corp, a Colorado corporation, was incorporated on June 3, 2013. We operate through our four wholly-owned subsidiaries: (a) 6565 E. Evans Owner LLC, a Colorado limited liability company formed in 2014; (b) General Cannabis Capital Corporation, a Colorado corporation formed in 2015; (c) GC Security LLC (GCS), a Colorado limited liability company formed in 2015; and (d) GC Corp., a Colorado corporation, originally formed in 2013 under ACS Corp. In 2015, the name was changed to GC Corp. 
Our Products, Services and Customers

Through our reporting segments (Security, Operations, Consumer Goods, and Investments), we provide products, services and capital to the regulated cannabis industry and non-cannabis customers, which include the following:
Security and Cash Transportation Services (Security Segment)

We provide advanced security, including on-site professionals and cash transport, to licensed cannabis cultivators, cannabis processing facilities and retail shops, under the business name Iron Protection Group (IPG) in California and Colorado, and security services to non-cannabis customers in Colorado, such as hotels, apartment buildings and retail, under the business name Mile High Protection Services (MHPS), which we acquired in August 2017.
Operations Consulting and Products (Operations Segment)

Through Next Big Crop (NBC), we deliver comprehensive consulting services to the cannabis industry that include obtaining licenses, compliance, cultivation, retail operations, logistical support, facility design and construction, and expansion of existing operations. During 2018, 60% of NBCs revenue was with one customer.

NBC oversees our wholesale equipment and supply business, operated under the name GC Supply, which provides turnkey sourcing and stocking services to cultivation, retail and infused products manufacturing facilities. Our products include building materials, equipment, consumables and compliance packaging. There are generally multiple suppliers for the products we sell; however, there are a limited number of manufacturers of certain high tech cultivation equipment.

Consumer Goods and Marketing Consulting (Consumer Goods Segment)

Our apparel business, Chiefton, has two primary revenue streams. Chiefton Supply strives to create innovative, unique t-shirts, hats, hoodies and accessories. Our apparel is sold through our on-line shop, cannabis retailers, non-cannabis retailers, and specialty t-shirt and gift shops. Chiefton Design provides design, branding and marketing strategy consulting services to the cannabis industry, which frequently includes sourcing and selling customer-specific apparel and accessories.
Capital Investments and Real Estate (Investments Segment)

As a publicly traded company, we have access to capital that may not be available to businesses operating in the cannabis industry. Accordingly, we may provide debt or equity capital through (a) loans or revolving lines of credit, (b) leasing real estate we own, or (c) investing in businesses using cash or shares of our common stock.
Significant Transactions

On November 7, 2018, we invested $250,000 in Flowhub Holdings, LLC (Flowhub) through a simple agreement for future equity (the Flowhub SAFE). The Flowhub SAFE provides us with the right to either (a) future equity in Flowhub when it completes an equity financing, or (b) future equity in Flowhub or cash proceeds if there is a liquidity event. If there is an equity financing, Flowhub would issue to us (a) a number of standard preferred units equal to our investment divided by the price per share of the standard preferred units if the pre-money valuation is less than or equal to the valuation cap ($35 million); or (b) a number of safe preferred units equal to the purchase amount divided by the safe price, if the pre-money valuation is greater than the valuation cap. If there is a liquidity event, we will receive either (a) a cash payment equal to the purchase amount or (b) automatically receive a number of common units equal to the purchase amount divided by the liquidity price.

In April 2018, we completed a $7,500,000 private placement pursuant to a promissory note (8.5% Notes) and warrant purchase agreement (the 8.5% Agreement) with certain accredited investors, bearing interest at 8.5%, with principal due May 1, 2019, and interest payable quarterly. In the event of default, the interest rate increases to 18%. The 8.5% Notes are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of our assets. We may prepay the 8.5% Notes at any time, but in any event must pay at least one year of interest.

In January 2018, we entered into a limited liability company operating agreement with DNFC LLC (DNFC), pursuant to the formation of Desert Created Company LLC (Desert Created). Each party owned a 50% interest in Desert Created, which took over the assets and operations of DB Products Arizona, LLC (DB Arizona). Desert Created produces and distributes cannabis-infused edible products in Arizona. In connection with the formation of Desert Created, we contributed 75,000 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 75,000 shares of our common stock, at an exercise price of $2.00 per share, to members of DNFC, for an initial investment of $979,000. This pricing was agreed to in November 2017, however, the transaction did not close until January 2018. In the interim, our stock price increased substantially, which resulted in an impairment of $805,500. In October 2018, we sold our 50% interest to DNFC for cash consideration of $23,045.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, in a private placement we raised $4 million of equity by issuing four million shares of our common stock and four million warrants (Fall 2017 Warrants) to purchase shares of our common stock (together Units) for $1.00 per Unit. The Fall 2017 Warrants had an exercise price of $0.50 per share and were exercisable for two years. If our common stock closed above $5.00 for ten consecutive days, we could call the warrants, giving the warrant holders 10 days to exercise. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we called the warrants, and all were exercised. In consideration for the sale of the Units, we received $3,750,000 in cash and extinguished $250,000 of 12% Notes.

On December 29, 2017, we sold for $625,000 in cash a cultivation property in a suburb of Pueblo, Colorado, which consisted of approximately three acres of land, a 5,000 square foot steel building and a parking lot. The sale resulted in a gain of $196,000. We previously leased this property to a licensed medical cannabis grower.

Competitive Strengths

We believe we possess certain competitive strengths and advantages in the industries in which we operate:

Range of Services. We are able to leverage our breadth of services and resources to deliver comprehensive, integrated solutions to companies in the cannabis industryfrom operational, compliance and marketing consulting, to products, security and financing services.
Strategic Alliances. We are dedicated to growing through strategic acquisitions, partnerships and agreements that will enable us to enter and expand into new markets. Our strategy is to pursue alliances with potential targets that have the ability to generate positive cash flow, effectively meet customer needs and supply desirable products, services or technologies, among other considerations. We anticipate that strategic alliances will play a significant role as more states pass legislation permitting the cultivation and sale of hemp and cannabis.
Regulatory Compliance. The state and local laws regulating the cannabis industry change at a rapid pace. We have resources committed to ensure our operations are in compliance with all state and local laws, policies, guidance and regulations to which we are subject. We apply this compliance knowledge to our customers in order to ensure that they, too, are in full compliance.
Industry Knowledge. We continue to create, share and leverage information and experiences with the purpose of creating awareness and identifying opportunities to increase shareholder value. Our management team has business expertise, extensive knowledge of the cannabis industry and closely monitors changes in legislation. We work with partners who enhance the breadth of our industry knowledge.
Lending Capabilities. In February 2014, the Treasury Department issued guidelines for financial institutions dealing with cannabis-related businesses, (see BusinessGovernment and Industry RegulationFinCEN). In January 2018, former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions revoked the Obama-era guidelines that enabled states to self-regulate cannabis-related business. Nevertheless, many banks and traditional financial institutions have continued to provide financial services to cannabis-related businesses.

Our best opportunities are in locations with large populations or legal recreational cannabis use. Continued development of the regulated cannabis industry depends on additional legalization, which is significantly influenced by state and local legislation.

Competition

Overall, we believe we have a competitive advantage by providing a range of goods and services to the cannabis industry. This allows us to provide integrated solutions to our customers, as well as sell additional goods and services to customers of a single segment. There is no aspect of our business, however, that is protected by patents or copyrights. As a result, our competitors could duplicate our business model with little effort.
Security and Cash Transportation Services. IPG faces competition from national security and cash transportation firms, as well as local agencies that provide general or cannabis-specific security services. We endeavor to establish a competitive advantage through our hiring practices, training and supervision to ensure we provide qualified, reliable service. The market for these services, however, is driven primarily by pricing and our competitors may offer lower prices for similar services.
Consumer Goods and Marketing Consulting. Our apparel line competes with local and national cannabis-oriented clothing sellers, as well as non-cannabis-related clothing. Our marketing services compete with local and national marketing agencies, which may or may not have a focus in the cannabis industry.
Operations Consulting and Products. There are a limited number of competitors that provide the full range of services that NBC delivers. However, each individual service we provide has competition from experts in individual, specific fields. For example, attorneys may assist with license procurement and compliance. There are numerous firms that specialize in traditional greenhouse and cultivation consulting, as well as companies that provide operations services. As the cannabis industry grows, these competitors may develop further expertise and expand their focus on the cannabis industry.
Capital Investments and Real Estate. Many banks and traditional financial institutions refuse to provide financial services to cannabis-related business. With the growth of the cannabis industry, however, there has been growth in alternative financing and banking resources. Many of these alternative sources have more capital and resources than we have.
Government and Industry Regulation

Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and is, therefore, illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized pursuant to state law, its use, possession and/or cultivation remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the DOJ) describes Schedule I controlled substances as the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence. If the federal government decides to enforce the CSA in Colorado with respect to state-regulated cannabis activities in Colorado and other states, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and/or terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.

In light of the conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis, the previous administration under President Obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. For example, the prior DOJ Deputy Attorney General of the Obama administration, James M. Cole, issued a memorandum (the Cole Memo) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA. In addition, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) provided guidelines (the FinCEN Guidelines) on February 14, 2014, regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) obligations (see  FinCEN).

Congress previously enacted an omnibus spending bill that included a provision (the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment) prohibiting the DOJ from using funds to prevent states with medical cannabis laws from implementing such laws. This provision, however, has only been extended to February 15, 2019, and must be renewed annually by Congress. In August 2016, a Ninth Circuit federal appeals court ruled in United States v. McIntosh that the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment bars the DOJ from spending funds on the prosecution of conduct that is allowed by state medical cannabis laws, provided that such conduct is in strict compliance with applicable state law. In March 2015, bipartisan legislation titled the Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States Act (the CARERS Act) was introduced, proposing to allow states to regulate the medical use of cannabis by changing applicable federal law, including by reclassifying cannabis

under the Controlled Substances Act to a Schedule II controlled substance and thereby changing the plant from a federally-criminalized substance to one that has recognized medical uses. More recently, the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2017 has been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives, which proposes to exclude persons who produce, possess, distribute, dispense, administer or deliver marijuana in compliance with state laws from the regulatory controls and administrative, civil and criminal penalties of the CSA.

These developments previously were met with a certain amount of optimism in the cannabis industry, but (i) neither the CARERS Act nor the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2017 have yet been adopted, (ii) the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, being an amendment to an appropriations bill that must be renewed annually, has not currently been renewed beyond February 15, 2019, and (iii) the ruling in United States v. McIntosh is only applicable precedent in the Ninth Circuit, which does not include Colorado, the state where we currently primarily operate.

Furthermore, on January 4, 2018, the former U.S. Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, issued a memorandum for all U.S. Attorneys (the Sessions Memo) stating that the Cole Memo was rescinded effectively immediately. In particular, Mr. Sessions stated that prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions, which require federal prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute to weigh all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community. The Sessions Memo went on to state that given the DOJs well-established general principles, previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana is unnecessary and is rescinded, effective immediately.

In response to the Sessions Memo, U.S. Attorney Bob Troy for the District of Colorado, the state in which our principal business operations are presently located, issued a statement on January 4, 2018, stating that the United States Attorneys Office in Colorado is already guided by the well-established principles referenced in the Sessions Memo, focusing in particular on identifying and prosecuting those who create the greatest safety threats to our communities around the state. We will, consistent with the Attorney Generals latest guidance, continue to take this approach in all of our work with our law enforcement partners throughout Colorado.

It is unclear at this time whether the Sessions Memo indicates that the Trump administration will strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis or what types of activities will be targeted for enforcement. However, a significant change in the federal governments enforcement policy with respect to current federal laws applicable to cannabis could cause significant financial damage to us. We do not currently cultivate, distribute or sell cannabis. We may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement policies of the federal government depending on the nature of such change. As of the date of this Report, we have provided products and services to state-approved cannabis cultivators and dispensary facilities. Accordingly, we could be subject to criminal prosecution, which could lead to imprisonment and/or the imposition of penalties, fines, or forfeiture .

The Cole Memo

Because of the discrepancy between the laws in some states, which permit the distribution and sale of medical and recreational cannabis, from federal law that prohibits any such activities, DOJ Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole issued the Cole Memo concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA.

At the time of its issuance, the Cole Memo reiterated Congresss determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and that the illegal distribution and sale of cannabis is a serious crime that provides a significant source of revenue to large-scale criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels. The Cole Memo noted that the DOJ was committed to enforcement of the CSA consistent with those determinations. It also noted that the DOJ was committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provided guidance to DOJ attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following important priorities (the Enforcement Priorities) in preventing:

·
 the distribution of cannabis to minors;
 ·
 revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels;
 ·
 the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states;
 ·
 state-authorized cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
 ·
 violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis;
 ·
 drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use;

8

·
 the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and
 ·
 cannabis possession or use on federal property.

Although the Sessions Memo has rescinded the Cole Memo and it is unclear at this time what the ultimate impact of that rescission will have on our business, if any, we intend to continue to conduct rigorous due diligence to verify the legality of all activities that we engage in and ensure that our activities do not interfere with any of the Enforcement Priorities set forth in the Cole Memo.

FinCEN

FinCEN provided guidance regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their BSA obligations. For purposes of the FinCEN guidelines, a financial institution includes any person doing business in one or more of the following capacities:

·
 bank (except bank credit card systems);
 ·
 broker or dealer in securities;
 ·
 money services business;
 ·
 telegraph company;
 ·
 card club; and
 ·
 a person subject to supervision by any state or federal bank supervisory authority.

In general, the decision to open, close, or refuse any particular account or relationship should be made by each financial institution based on a number of factors specific to that institution. These factors may include its particular business objectives, an evaluation of the risks associated with offering a particular product or service, and its capacity to manage those risks effectively. Thorough customer due diligence is a critical aspect of making this assessment.

In assessing the risk of providing services to a cannabis-related business, a financial institution should conduct customer due diligence that includes: (i) verifying with the appropriate state authorities whether the business is duly licensed and registered; (ii) reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for obtaining a state license to operate its cannabis-related business; (iii) requesting from state licensing and enforcement authorities available information about the business and related parties; (iv) developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including the types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (e.g., medical versus recreational customers); (v) ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business and related parties; (vi) ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for any of the red flags described in this guidance; and (vii) refreshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and commensurate with the risk. With respect to information regarding state licensure obtained in connection with such customer due diligence, a financial institution may reasonably rely on the accuracy of information provided by state licensing authorities, where states make such information available.

As part of its customer due diligence, a financial institution should consider whether a cannabis-related business implicates one of the Cole Memo Enforcement Priorities or violates state law. This is a particularly important factor for a financial institution to consider when assessing the risk of providing financial services to a cannabis-related business. Considering this factor also enables the financial institution to provide information in BSA reports pertinent to law enforcements priorities. A financial institution that decides to provide financial services to a cannabis-related business would be required to file suspicious activity reports. It is unclear at this time what impact the Sessions Memo will have on customer due diligence by a financial institution.

While we believe we do not qualify as a financial institution in the United States, we cannot be certain that we do not fall under the scope of the FinCEN guidelines. We plan to use the FinCEN Guidelines, as may be amended, as a basis for assessing our relationships with potential tenants, clients and customers. As such, as we engage in financing activities, we intend to adhere to the guidance of FinCEN in conducting and monitoring our financial transactions. Because this area of the law is uncertain and is expected to evolve rapidly, we believe that FinCENs guidelines will help us best operate in a prudent, reasonable and acceptable manner. There is no assurance, however, that our activities will not violate some aspect of the CSA. If we are found to violate the federal statute or any other in connection with our activities, our company could face serious criminal and civil sanctions.

Moreover, since the use of cannabis is illegal under federal law, we may have difficulty acquiring or maintaining bank accounts and insurance, and our stockholders may find it difficult to deposit their stock with brokerage firms.

Licensing and Local Regulations

Where applicable, we apply for state licenses or similar approvals that are necessary to conduct our business in compliance with local laws. Our subsidiary, GC Corp., has been registered with Colorados Marijuana Enforcement Division (the MED) as an approved vendor since September 8, 2014. GCS, another subsidiary, has been registered as a MED approved vendor since March 11, 2015.

Local laws at the county and municipal level add an additional layer of complexity to legalized cannabis. Despite a states adoption of legislation legalizing cannabis, counties and municipalities within the state may have the ability to otherwise restrict cannabis activities, including but not limited to cultivation, retail, distribution, manufacturing or consumption.

Zoning sets forth the approved use of land in any given city, county or municipality. Zoning is set by local governments or local voter referendum, and may otherwise be restricted by state laws. For example, under certain state laws a seller of liquor may not be allowed to operate within 1,000 feet of a school. There may be similar restrictions imposed on cannabis operators, which will restrict where cannabis operations may be located and the manner and size to which they can grow and operate. Zoning can be subject to change or withdrawal, discretionary approvals may be required for certain uses, and properties can be re-zoned. The zoning of our properties will have a direct impact on our business operations.

Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had 82 full-time employees.
