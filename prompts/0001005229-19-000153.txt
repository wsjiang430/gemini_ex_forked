Item 1.        Business
General
Columbus McKinnon is a leading worldwide designer, manufacturer and marketer of motion control products, technologies, systems and services that efficiently and ergonomically move, lift, position and secure materials. Key products include hoists, rigging tools, digital power control systems, and actuators. The Company is focused on commercial and industrial applications that require safety and productivity in moving material provided by our superior design and engineering know-how. Our products are used for mission critical industrial applications where we have established trusted brands with significant customer retention. Our targeted market verticals include general industrial, construction and infrastructure, mining, oil & gas, energy, aerospace, transportation, automotive, heavy equipment manufacturing and entertainment.
In the U.S., we are the market leader for hoists and material handling digital power control systems, our principal line of products, as well as certain chain, forged fittings, and actuator products. We have achieved this leadership position through strategic acquisitions, our extensive, diverse, and well-established distribution channels and our commitment to product innovation and quality. We believe the breadth of our product offering and expansive distribution channels provide us a strategic advantage in our markets. Additionally, we believe we are the market leader for manual hoist and actuator products in Europe. Our market leadership and strong brands enable us to sell more products than our competition through our extensive distribution channels in the U.S. and Europe. The acquisition of STAHL CraneSystems ("STAHL") in fiscal 2017, which is well renowned for its custom engineering lifting solutions and hoisting technology, advanced our position as a global leader in the production of explosion-protected hoists. STAHL serves independent crane builders and Engineering Procurement and Construction ("EPC") firms, providing products to a variety of end markets including automotive, general manufacturing, oil and gas, steel and concrete, power generation, as well as process industries such as chemical and pharmaceuticals.
Our Blueprint for Growth Strategy is a three-phased strategy to increase the earnings power of the Company and transform us into a growth-oriented industrial technology company. The goal of our strategy is to increase our earnings power and expand EBITDA margins, as well as improve our Return on Invested Capital. Phase I, which began early in fiscal 2018, was focused on attaining operational control and instilling a performance based culture to drive results. 
We completed Phase I during fiscal 2018. In doing so, we believe we grew market share in the U.S. and achieved $6 million of synergies related to the STAHL acquisition. In addition, we introduced several new products incorporating smart hoist technologies and repaid $60 million of our long-term debt.
We began Phase II of the strategy in November 2017. This phase is about simplifying the business utilizing our 80/20 process, improving our operational excellence, and ramping the growth engine by investing in new product development and a digital platform to grow profitably. Investment in R&D will advance our smart hoist technology and enhance our customers’ digital experience so we can capitalize on the automation megatrend. We expect to double R&D expenditures by fiscal 2021 from fiscal 2017 levels, including approximately $5 million related to STAHL. Research and development costs were $13,491,000, $13,617,000, and $10,482,000 in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
In addition to restructuring our organization to simplify how we do business, we have divested three businesses, which were not a fit with our product offerings and strategy. In March 2019, the Company announced that it had completed the divestiture of these three businesses that it had identified as not being core to its growth strategy through its simplification process. The Tire Shredder business was sold in December 2018. The remaining two businesses, which were sold in February 2019, included Crane Equipment and Service, Inc. and Stahlhammer Bommern GmbH. 
Phase III of the strategy is centered on evolving the business model including optimizing our current product portfolio as well as pursuing acquisitions to advance our transformation into a leading industrial technology company. Our acquisitions of Magnetek, Inc. and STAHL and our efforts to leverage their technology are well aligned with our transformation efforts. We have demonstrated our ability to acquire companies and achieve significant synergies and growth. We will look for acquisitions in the material handling and motion control markets. We believe the automation megatrend will provide a deep pipeline of attractive, high margin companies that will continue to transform us. 
Our business is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including changes in industrial capacity utilization, industrial production, and general economic activity indicators, like GDP growth. Both U.S. and Eurozone capacity utilization are leading market indicators for our Company.

Hoists - We manufacture a wide variety of electric chain hoists, electric wire rope hoists, hand-operated hoists, winches, lever tools, and air-powered hoists. Load capacities for our hoist product lines range from one-eighth of a ton to nearly 140 tons with the acquisition of STAHL. These products are sold under our Budgit, Chester, CM, Coffing, Little Mule, Pfaff, Shaw-Box, Yale, STAHL, and other recognized brands. Our hoists are sold for use in numerous general industrial applications, as well as for use in the construction, energy, mining, food services, entertainment, and other markets. We also supply hoist trolleys, driven manually or by electric motors, that are used in conjunction with hoists.
We also offer several lines of standard and custom-designed, below-the-hook tooling, clamps, and textile strappings. Below-the-hook tooling, textile, and chain slings and associated forgings, and clamps are specialized lifting apparatus used in a variety of lifting activities performed in conjunction with hoisting or lifting applications.
STAHL primarily manufactures explosion-protected hoists and custom engineered hoists, including wire rope and manual and electric chain hoists. STAHL products are sold to a variety of end markets including automotive, general manufacturing, oil and gas, steel and concrete, power generation as well as process industries such as chemical and pharmaceuticals.

Chain and Rigging Tools -   We manufacture alloy and carbon steel chain for various industrial and consumer applications. U.S. federal regulations require the use of alloy chain, which we first developed, for overhead lifting applications because of its strength and wear characteristics. A line of our alloy chain is sold under the Herc-AlloyTM brand name for use in overhead lifting, pulling, and restraining applications. In addition, we also sell specialized load chain for use in hoists, as well as three grades and multiple sizes of carbon steel welded-link chain for various load securing and other non-overhead lifting applications.

We produce a broad line of alloy and carbon steel closed-die forged chain attachments, including hooks, shackles, HammerloksTM, and master links. These forged attachments are used in chain, wire rope, and textile rigging applications in a variety of industries, including transportation, mining, construction, marine, logging, petrochemical, and agriculture. 
In addition, we manufacture carbon steel forged and stamped products, such as load binders, logging tools, and other securing devices, for sale to the industrial and logging markets through industrial distributors, hardware distributors, mass merchandiser outlets, and Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs").

Digital Power Control and Delivery Systems - Through our Magnetek brand, we are a leading provider of innovative power control and delivery systems and solutions for overhead material handling applications used in a number of diverse industries, including aerospace, automotive, steel, aluminum, paper, logging, mining, ship loading, nuclear power plants, and heavy movable structures. We are a major supplier in North America of power and motion control systems, which include AC and DC drive systems, radio remote controls, push button pendant stations, brakes, and collision avoidance and power delivery subsystems. While we sell primarily to OEMs of overhead cranes and hoists, we spend a great deal of effort understanding the needs of end users to gain specification. We can combine our products with engineered services to provide complete customer-specific systems solutions.
We are also a leading independent supplier of AC and DC digital motion control systems for underground coal mining equipment. Our systems are used in coal hauling vehicles, shuttle cars, scoops, and other heavy mining equipment. 
Actuators and Rotary Unions - Through our Duff-Norton and Pfaff brands, we design and manufacture industrial components such as mechanical and electromechanical actuators and rotary unions. Actuators are linear motion devices used in a variety of industries, including the transportation, paper, steel, energy, aerospace, and many other commercial industries. Rotary unions are devices that transfer a liquid or gas from a fixed pipe or hose to a rotating drum, cylinder or other device. Rotary unions are used in a variety of industries including pulp and paper, printing, textile and fabric manufacturing, rubber, and plastic.
Elevator Application Drive Systems - Through our Magnetek brand we also design, build, sell, and support elevator application-specific drive products that efficiently deliver power used to control motion, primarily in high-rise, high-speed elevator applications. We are recognized as an industry leader for DC high-performance elevator drives, as well as for AC drives used with low- and high-performance traction elevators, due to our extensive application expertise and product reliability. Our elevator product offerings are comprised of highly integrated subsystems and drives, sold mainly to elevator OEMs. In addition, our product options include a number of regenerative controls for both new building installations and elevator modernization projects that help building owners save energy. 

Distribution and Markets

Our distribution channels include a variety of commercial distributors. In addition, we sell aluminum light rail systems as well as certain motion technology products directly to end-users. The following describes our global distribution channels:

General Distribution Channels -   Our global general distribution channels consist of:
—     Industrial distributors that serve local or regional industrial markets and sell a variety of products for maintenance repair, operating, and production, or MROP, applications through their own direct sales force.


— | Rigging shops that are distributors with expertise in rigging, lifting, positioning, and load securing. Most rigging shops assemble and distribute chain, wire rope and synthetic slings, and distribute manual hoists and attachments, chain slings, and other products.


— | Independent crane builders that design, build, install, and service overhead crane and light-rail systems for general industry and also distribute a wide variety of hoists and crane components. We sell electric wire rope hoists and chain hoists as well as crane components, such as end trucks, trolleys, drives, and electrification systems to crane builders.


Specialty Distribution Channels -   Our global specialty distribution channels consist of:

— | National and regional distributors that market a variety of MROP supplies, including material handling products, either exclusively through large, nationally distributed catalogs, or through a combination of catalog, internet, and branch sales and a field sales force.

— | Material handling specialists and integrators that design and assemble systems incorporating hoists, overhead rail systems, trolleys, scissor lift tables, manipulators, air balancers, jib arms, and other material handling products to provide end-users with solutions to their material handling problems.


— | Entertainment equipment distributors that design, supply, and install a variety of material handling and rigging equipment for concerts, theaters, ice shows, sporting events, convention centers, and night clubs.

Pfaff International Direct -   Our German-based Pfaff business markets and sells most of its actuators directly to end-users, providing an additional method to market for us in the European region.

Service-After-Sale Distribution Channel -   Service-after-sale distributors include our authorized network of 23 chain repair service stations and over 221 certified hoist service and repair stations globally. This service network is designed for easy parts and service access for our large installed base of hoists and related equipment in that region.

OEM/Government Distribution Channels - This channel consists of:


— | OEMs that supply various component parts directly to other industrial manufacturers as well as private branding and packaging of our traditional products for material handling, lifting, positioning, and special purpose applications.


— | Government agencies, including the U.S. and Canadian Navies and Coast Guards, that primarily purchase load securing chain and forged attachments. We also provide our products to the U.S. and other governments for a variety of military applications.

Independent Crane Builders and Engineering Procurement and Construction ("EPC") firms -   In addition to the Distribution channels mentioned above, STAHL sells explosion-protected hoists and custom engineered non-standard hoists to independent crane builders and EPC firms. Independent crane builders are lifting solution developers and final crane assemblers that source hoists as components. EPC firms are responsible for project management or construction management of production facilities that purchase lifting solutions from crane and hoist builders.
Backlog

Our backlog of orders at March 31, 2019 was approximately $161,456,000 compared to approximately $177,387,000 at March 31, 2018. The decrease is largely a result of divestitures and changing foreign currency rates. Our orders for standard products are generally shipped within one week. Orders for products that are manufactured to customer specifications are generally shipped within four to twelve weeks. Given the short product lead times, we do not believe that the amount of our backlog of orders is a reliable indication of our future sales.  Fluctuations in backlog can reflect the project oriented nature of certain aspects of our business.
Competitive Conditions

The material handling industry remains fragmented. We face competition from a wide range of regional, national, and international manufacturers globally. In addition, we often compete with individual operating units of larger, highly diversified companies.

The principal competitive factors affecting our business include customer service and support as well as product availability, performance, functionality, brand reputation, reliability, and price. Other important factors include distributor relationships and territory coverage.
We believe we have leading U.S. market share in various products categories including: hoists, trolleys and components, AC and DC material handling drives, screw jacks, and elevator DC drives. These product categories represent 65% of our U.S. net sales.
Major competitors for hoists are Konecranes, which acquired Terex's Material Handling and Part Solutions business segment, and Kito (and its U.S. subsidiary Harrington); for chain are Campbell Chain, Peerless Chain Company (acquired by Kito), and American Chain and Cable Company; for digital power control systems are Konecranes, Power Electronics International, Inc., Cattron Group International (a division of Laird Technologies), Conductix-Wampfler (a division of Delachaux Group), Control Techniques (a division of Emerson Electric), OMRON Corporation, KEB GmbH, and Fujitec; for forged attachments are The Crosby Group and Brewer Tichner Company; for cranes are Konecranes and a variety of independent crane builders; and for actuators and rotary unions are Deublin, Joyce-Dayton, and Nook Industries.

Employees

At March 31, 2019, we had 3,128 employees globally. Approximately 10% of our employees are represented under three separate U.S. collective bargaining agreements which terminate at various times between May 2020 and September 2021. We also have various labor agreements with our non-U.S. employees which we negotiate from time to time. We have good relationships with our employees and positive, productive relationships with our unions. The risk of employee or union led disruption in production is remote.
Raw Materials and Components

Our principal raw materials and components are steel, consisting of rod, wire, bar, structural, and other forms of steel; electric motors; bearings; gear reducers; castings; steel and aluminum enclosures and wire harnesses; electro-mechanical components and standard variable drives. These commodities are all available from multiple sources.  We purchase most of these raw materials and components from a limited number of strategic and preferred suppliers under long-term agreements which are negotiated on a company-wide basis through our global purchasing group to take advantage of volume discounts. Generally, as we experience fluctuations in our costs, we reflect them as price increases to our customers with the goal of being margin neutral. In addition, as a result of the recent trade tariff actions with China, the Company determined its fiscal 2019 exposure for tariffs to be approximately $1,700,000 which resulted in increased cost of products sold. The Company is monitoring the impact of tariffs and is actively working to mitigate this impact through material productivity actions and pricing strategies. For all other raw materials and components, our ability to pass on these increases is determined by market conditions.  Although raw materials and some components (such as motors, bearings, gear reducers, steel and aluminum enclosures and wire harnesses, castings, electro-mechanical components, and standard variable drives) are purchased, our vertical integration enables us to produce many of the components used in the manufacturing of our products. 
Environmental and Other Governmental Regulation

Like most manufacturing companies, we are subject to various federal, state, and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. To address the requirements of such laws, we have adopted a corporate environmental protection policy which provides that all of our owned or leased facilities shall comply, and all of our employees have the duty to comply with all applicable environmental regulatory standards, and we have initiated an environmental auditing program for our facilities to ensure compliance with such regulatory standards. We have also established managerial responsibilities and internal communication channels for dealing with environmental compliance issues that may arise in the course of our business. We have made and could be required to continue to make significant expenditures to comply with environmental requirements.  Because of the complexity and changing nature of environmental regulatory standards, it is possible that situations will arise from time to time requiring us to incur additional expenditures to ensure environmental regulatory compliance. However, we are not aware of any environmental condition or any operation at any of our facilities, either individually or in the aggregate, which would cause expenditures having a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 

We have been a part of the Pendleton Site PRP Group since about 1993.  Many years ago, we sent pickle liquor wastes from Tonawanda, NY to the Pendleton Site for treatment and disposal.  The Pendleton Site PRP Group signed an Order on Consent with the NYS DEC in 1996 and the cleanup was concluded in the early 2000s.  The Order on Consent required a post-construction operation and maintenance period of 30 years and we are required to pay our share of the costs associated with the operation and maintenance period.  Our share of these costs is 13.4% and reserves on the books are sufficient to cover these costs for the remainder of the operations and maintenance period.
In 1986, Magnetek acquired the stock of Universal Manufacturing Corporation (“Universal”) from a predecessor of Fruit of the Loom (“FOL”), and the predecessor agreed to indemnify Magnetek against certain environmental liabilities arising from pre-acquisition activities at a facility in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Environmental liabilities covered by the indemnification agreement included completion of additional cleanup activities, if any, at the Bridgeport facility and defense and indemnification against liability for potential response costs related to offsite disposal locations. Magnetek's leasehold interest in the Bridgeport facility was assigned to the buyer in connection with the sale of Magnetek's transformer business in June 2001. FOL, the successor to the indemnification obligation, filed a petition for Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in 1999 and Magnetek filed a proof of claim in the proceeding for obligations related to the environmental indemnification agreement. Magnetek believes that FOL had substantially completed the clean-up obligations required by the indemnification agreement prior to the bankruptcy filing. In November 2001, Magnetek and FOL entered into an agreement involving the allocation of certain potential tax benefits and Magnetek withdrew its claims in the bankruptcy proceeding. FOL's obligation to the state of Connecticut was not discharged in the reorganization proceeding.

In January 2007, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (“DEP”) requested parties, including Magnetek, to submit reports summarizing the investigations and remediation performed to date at the site and the proposed additional investigations and remediation necessary to complete those actions at the site. The DEP then requested additional information relating to site investigations and remediation. Magnetek and the DEP agreed to the scope of the work plan in November 2010. The Company has implemented the work plan and has recorded a liability of $456,000 as of March 31, 2019 related to the Bridgeport facility, representing the best estimate of future site investigation costs and remediation costs which are expected to be incurred in the future. 
For all of the currently known environmental matters, we have accrued as of March 31, 2019 a total of $1,075,000 which, in our opinion, is sufficient to deal with such matters. Further, we believe that the environmental matters known to, or anticipated by us should not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. However, there can be no assurance that potential liabilities and expenditures associated with unknown environmental matters, unanticipated events, or future compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us.
In September of 2017, Magnetek received a request for defense and indemnification from Monsanto Company, Pharmacia, LLC, and Solutia, Inc. (collectively, “Monsanto”) with respect to: (1) lawsuits brought by plaintiffs claiming that Monsanto manufactured polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs"), exposure to which allegedly caused injury to plaintiffs; (2) lawsuits brought by municipalities and municipal entities claiming that Monsanto should be responsible for a variety of damages due to the presence of PCBs in bodies of water in those municipalities and/or in water treated by those municipal entities.  Monsanto claims to be entitled to defense and indemnification from Magnetek under a so-called “Special Undertaking” apparently executed by Universal in January of 1972, which purportedly required Universal to defend and indemnify Monsanto from liabilities “arising out of or in connection with the receipt, purchase, possession, handling, use, sale or disposition of” PCBs by Universal.

Magnetek has declined Monsanto’s tender, and believes that it has meritorious legal and factual defenses to the demands made by Monsanto.  Magnetek is vigorously defending against those demands and has commenced litigation to, among other things, declare the Special Undertaking void and unenforceable.  Monsanto has, in turn, commenced an action to enforce the Special Undertaking.  Magnetek intends to continue to vigorously prosecute its declaratory judgment action and to defend against Monsanto’s action against it.  As of March 31, 2019 the Company has recorded $100,000 for legal costs related to this matter. We cannot reasonably estimate a potential range of loss with respect to Monsanto’s tender because there is insufficient information regarding the underlying matters.  Management believes, however, that the potential additional costs related to such matters, if any, will not have a material effect on the financial condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period. 
Our operations are also governed by many other laws and regulations, including those relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally OSHA in the U.S. and others outside the U.S. and regulations thereunder. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations and do not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or liquidity.
