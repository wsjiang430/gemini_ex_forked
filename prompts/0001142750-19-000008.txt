Overview of Our Company and Business Strategy
We are the leader and innovator in workforce solutions for the healthcare sector in the United States. We are passionate about our mission to:

• | Create recruiting and retention solutions that help healthcare organizations cope with increasing supply and demand pressures caused by aging of the patient population and clinical labor force.


• | Deliver the right talent and insights to help our clients optimize their workforce.


• | Provide healthcare professionals opportunities to do their best work toward high-quality patient care.


• | Create a values-based culture of innovation in which our team members can achieve their goals.

Our solutions enable our clients to optimize their workforce to simplify staffing complexity, increase efficiency and elevate the patient experience. Our comprehensive suite of solutions provides technology, analytics, and services to build and manage all or part of our clients’ healthcare workforce needs, from nurses, doctors, and allied health professionals to healthcare leaders and executives, while offering these professionals temporary, project and permanent career opportunities.
Over the past decade, our business has evolved beyond traditional healthcare staffing; we have become a strategic workforce solutions partner with our clients. We expanded our portfolio to serve a diverse and growing set of talent-related needs. This includes managed services programs (“MSP”), vendor management systems (“VMS”), predictive labor analytics, workforce optimization technology and consulting, clinical labor scheduling, recruitment process outsourcing (“RPO”),

permanent placement, interim executives and leaders, mid-revenue cycle management, and credentialing software services. We enable clients to build and develop high-quality, flexible workforces that deliver great outcomes and a satisfying patient experience. Our talent network includes thousands of highly skilled, experienced clinicians and leaders who trust us to place them in environments that help them expand and leverage their qualifications and expertise.
When developing and acquiring services and products, we consider many important criteria: (1) identifying and addressing the most pressing current and future needs of our customers and talent network; (2) solutions that are aligned with our core operations, expertise, and access to healthcare professionals; (3) ways to strengthen and broaden our client and healthcare professional relationships; (4) businesses that reduce our sensitivity to economic cycles; and (5) offerings that differentiate us from competitors. Since 2010, we have expanded, developed or acquired the following business lines:

• | Managed Services Programs. We acquired Medfinders, one of the nation’s leading providers of clinical workforce MSP, accelerating our growth in this area and clearly establishing AMN Healthcare as the nation’s largest provider of clinical contingent workforce management solutions.


• | Vendor Management Systems. We offer two industry-leading SaaS-based, vendor management systems, ShiftWise and Medefis, that allow our clients to utilize a technology-based approach to more efficiently manage their contingent staffing needs.


• | Interim Leadership Staffing and Executive Search Services. Through B.E. Smith (“BES”), Phillips DiPisa & Associates (“PDA”), The First String Healthcare (“TFS”) and Leaders For Today (“LFT”), we believe we are the nation’s largest provider of interim healthcare leadership staffing and healthcare executive search services, providing clinical and executive leaders and other related advisory services.


• | Workforce Optimization Services. Through Avantas, we offer workforce optimization services, including consulting, data analytics, predictive modeling and SaaS-delivered scheduling technology. We believe Avantas’ proprietary scheduling software enables more cost-effective staffing for our clients compared with traditional approaches.


• | Recruitment Process Outsourcing. We continue to invest in our RPO service line, adding technologies and other capabilities to meet our clients’ growing needs for core staff recruitment expertise and services and provide a cost-effective ways to source critical healthcare talent.


• | Mid-Revenue Cycle Management. MedPartners and Peak Health Solutions offer staffing solutions for remote medical coding, clinical documentation improvement, case management, clinical data registry and related auditing and consulting services.


• | Expanded Our Network of Qualified Healthcare Professionals. Through our Onward Healthcare acquisition, we increased our supply of healthcare professionals and recruiting capabilities in our traditional healthcare staffing areas of nurse, allied and locum tenens. This move also bolstered our ability to serve MSP clients.


• | Per Diem and Digital Staffing. Our acquisition of Medfinders provided us entry into the local, or per diem, staffing market, often in conjunction with our larger MSP clients. Through investment in new technologies, we are streamlining the match of the right clinicians to the right assignment to meet the on-demand needs of our clients.


• | Credentialing Services. Through our recent acquisition of Silversheet, we offer SaaS-based credentialing technology. We believe Silversheet’s credentialing software enhances our clients’ ability to provide safe, effective, and high-quality medical care for patients.

Continuous improvement of our operations and business technology is a core component of our growth strategy and profitability goals. In 2015 we embarked on a multi-year investment in the modernization of our front office, back office and infrastructure domains. We also have accelerated the integration of technology-based solutions in our core recruitment processes through targeted investment in digital capabilities, mobile applications and data analytics. These innovations will provide a more seamless and efficient workflow for our team members, our healthcare professionals and our clients. Updated business systems will help us realize greater scale and cost efficiencies when fully implemented.
Our strategy is designed to support growth in our number and size of customer relationships and segments of the market we serve, while enhancing our profitability and operating leverage. Driving increased adoption of our existing workforce solutions and staffing services through cross-selling will deepen our customer relationships as they grow and expand. We will continue to innovate, develop and invest in new, complementary solutions to our portfolio that optimize our clients’ workforce and better engage our talent network. We expect this will help us expand our strategic customer relationships to help clients address their workforce pain points, while driving more recurring revenue, with an improved margin mix that, similar to our leadership in MSPs, will be less sensitive to economic cycles.
Successful implementation of our strategy relies in large part upon the superior execution of our key initiatives by our management, sales and operations teams. Accordingly, we have differentiated our employment value proposition to attract and retain diverse and highly effective team members. We foster a growth-oriented, values-driven culture, talented leadership, and a collegial work environment that challenges and encourages us to develop and meet personal and professional goals. In 2018, AMN was recognized on the Fortune 100 Fastest Growing Companies list and was also named to the 2018 Human Rights 
2


Campaign Corporate Equality Index. We were named to the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for 2018 and 2019. AMN continues to be recognized as a leading employer and was recognized among the 2018 Becker’s Hospital Review Top 150 Places to Work in Healthcare and 2018 National Best & Brightest Companies to Work For lists.
Our Services

In 2018, we conducted our business through three reportable segments: (1) nurse and allied solutions, (2) locum tenens solutions and (3) other workforce solutions. We set forth each segment’s revenue and operating income under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations.” Through our business segments, we provide our healthcare clients with a wide range of workforce solutions and staffing services as set forth below. 

(1) Travel Nurse Staffing. We provide clients with nurses, most of them registered nurses, to work temporary assignments under our flagship brand, American Mobile, as well as under our Onward Healthcare and Nurses Rx brands. Assignments in acute-care hospitals, including teaching institutions, trauma centers and community hospitals, comprise the majority of our assignments. The length of the assignment varies with a typical travel nurse assignment of 13 weeks. Under our O’Grady-Peyton brand, we also recruit nurses internationally from English speaking countries who immigrate to the United States under a permanent resident visa (Green Card) and who typically work for us for a period of 24 months.

(2) | Rapid Response Nurse Staffing and Labor Disruption Services. We provide a shorter-term staffing solution of typically up to eight weeks under our NurseChoice brand to address hospitals’ urgent need for registered nurses, including electronic medical records conversion projects. NurseChoice is targeted to recruit and staff nurses who can begin assignments within one to two weeks in contrast to the three to five week lead time that may be required for travel nurses. We also provide labor disruption services for clients involved in strikes of nurses and allied professional staff through our HealthSource Global Staffing brand.


(3) | Local, or Per Diem, Staffing. Through our Nursefinders brand, we provide our clients local staffing, often in support of our MSP clients. Local staffing involves the placement of locally-based healthcare professionals on daily shift work on an as-needed basis. Hospitals and healthcare facilities often give only a few hours’ notice of their local staffing assignments that require a turnaround from their staffing agencies of generally less than 24 hours.


(4) | Locum Tenens Staffing. We place physicians of all specialties, advanced practice clinicians and dentists on an independent contractor basis on temporary assignments with all types of healthcare organizations throughout the United States, including hospitals, health systems, medical groups, occupational medical clinics, psychiatric facilities, government institutions and insurance companies. We recruit these professionals nationwide and typically place them on assignment lengths ranging from a few days up to one year. We market these services through our Staff Care and Locum Leaders brands.


(5) | Allied Staffing. We provide allied health professionals under the Med Travelers and Club Staffing brands to acute-care hospitals and other healthcare facilities such as skilled nursing facilities, rehabilitation clinics, and retail and mail-order pharmacies. Allied health professionals include such disciplines as physical therapists, respiratory therapists, occupational therapists, medical and radiology technologists, lab technicians, speech pathologists, rehabilitation assistants and pharmacists.


(6) | Physician Permanent Placement Services. We provide retained search, physician permanent placement services to hospitals, healthcare facilities and physician practice groups throughout the United States through our Merritt Hawkins brand. We also provide a physician executive leadership search services focused on serving academic medical centers and children’s hospitals nationwide.


(7) | Interim Leadership Staffing and Executive Search Services. Under the brand names B.E. Smith, Phillips DiPisa, The First String and Leaders For Today, we provide executive and clinical leadership interim staffing, healthcare executive search services and advisory services. Practice areas include senior healthcare executives, physician executives, chief nursing officers and other clinical and operational leaders. This business line provides us greater access to the “C-suite” of our clients and prospective clients, which we believe helps improve our visibility as a strategic partner to them and helps provide us with cross-selling opportunities.


(8) | Managed Services Programs. Many of our clients and prospective clients use a number of healthcare staffing agencies to fulfill their nurse, allied and locum tenens staffing needs. We offer a comprehensive managed services program, in which we manage all or a portion of a client’s contingent staffing needs. This service includes both the placement of our own healthcare professionals and the utilization of other staffing agencies to fulfill the client’s staffing needs. We believe an MSP reduces redundancies for our clients and allows them to optimize their staffing utilization. We often use our own VMS technology as part of our MSP, which we believe

3


further enhances the value of our service offering. In 2018, we had approximately $1.2 billion in annualized gross billings under management under our MSPs and approximately 42% of our consolidated revenue flowed through MSP relationships compared with approximately 1% in 2008.

(9) | Vendor Management Systems. Some clients and prospective clients prefer a vendor-neutral VMS technology that allows them to self-manage procurement of contingent clinical labor. We provide two VMS technologies, ShiftWise and Medefis, to clients that desire this option. Our VMS technology provides, among other things, control over a wide variety of tasks via a single system and consolidated reporting. In 2018, we had approximately $1.2 billion in annualized gross billings flow through our VMS programs, for which we typically earn a 4-5% fee.


(10) | Recruitment Process Outsourcing. We offer our clients RPO services, customized to their particular needs, in which we recruit, hire and/or onboard permanent clinical and nonclinical positions on behalf of the client. Our RPO program leverages our expertise and support systems to replace or complement a client’s existing internal recruitment functions for permanent hiring needs, providing cost-effective flexibility to our clients to determine how to best obtain and use recruiting resources.


(11) | Workforce Optimization Services. We provide workforce optimization services, including consulting, data analytics, predictive labor demand modeling and SaaS-delivered scheduling technology. Our Avantas business provides proprietary scheduling software, Smart Square, which uses predictive analytics to create better, more accurate and timely staffing plans for a client, which has been demonstrated to reduce a client’s clinical labor spend.


(12) | Mid-Revenue Cycle Management. Our MedPartners and Peak Health Solutions brands provide skilled labor solutions for remote medical coding, clinical documentation improvement, case management, and clinical data registry, also provide auditing and advisory services. Clients include hospitals and physician medical groups nationwide.


(13) | Credentialing Services. Through our recent acquisition of Silversheet, we provide innovative credentialing software solutions to clinicians and healthcare enterprises. Silversheet’s products help reduce the complexity and challenges of the clinician credentialing process, and greatly improve the clinician experience.

Our Healthcare Professionals

The recruitment of a sufficient number of qualified healthcare professionals to work on temporary assignments and for placement at healthcare organizations is critical to the success of our business. Healthcare professionals choose temporary assignments for a variety of reasons that include seeking flexible work opportunities, exploring diverse practice settings, building skills and experience by working at prestigious healthcare facilities, avoiding the demands and political environment of working as permanent staff, working through life and career transitions, and as a means of access into a permanent staff position.
We recruit our healthcare professionals, depending on the particular service line, under the following brands: American Mobile, Nursefinders, NurseChoice, NursesRx, HealthSource Global Staffing, Med Travelers, Club Staffing, Onward Healthcare, B.E. Smith, The First String Healthcare, Phillips DiPisa, Leaders For Today, O’Grady Peyton International, Staff Care, Locum Leaders, Merritt Hawkins, MedPartners and Peak Health Solutions. Our multi-brand recruiting strategy is supported by innovative and effective marketing programs that focus on lead management, including our digital presence on websites, social media, and mobile applications. Word-of-mouth referrals from the thousands of current and former healthcare professionals we have placed enhance our effectiveness at reaching healthcare professionals. While we are committed to this multi-brand strategy, we regularly assess our brands to drive brand clarity and maximize efficiencies.
Our process to attract and retain healthcare professionals for temporary assignments depends on (1) offering a large selection of assignment locations, settings and opportunities for career development, (2) creating attractive compensation packages, (3) developing passionate, knowledgeable recruiters and service professionals who understand the needs of our healthcare professionals and provide a personalized approach, and (4) maintaining a reputation for excellence. The attractive compensation package that we provide our healthcare professionals includes a competitive wage, professional development opportunities, professional liability insurance, 401(k) plan and health insurance. In addition, we may provide reimbursements for meals and incidentals, travel and housing, or we may provide company housing if a healthcare professional elects not to receive reimbursement.

Our Geographic Markets and Client Base

During each of the past three years, (1) we generated all of our revenue in the United States and (2) all of our long-lived assets were located in the United States. We typically generate revenue in all 50 states. During 2018, the largest percentages of our revenue were concentrated in California, Virginia and New York. 
More than half of our temporary and contract healthcare professional assignments occur at acute-care hospitals. In addition to acute-care hospitals, we provide services to sub-acute healthcare facilities, physician groups, rehabilitation centers, dialysis clinics, pharmacies, home health service providers and ambulatory surgery centers. Our clients, many of the largest and most prestigious and progressive health care systems in the country, include Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Catholic Health Initiatives, MedStar Health, LifePoint Health, Stanford Hospital and Clinics, Providence St. Joseph Health, New York Presbyterian Health System, Tenet Health, HCA, PeaceHealth and Sentara Healthcare. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (and its affiliates), to whom we provide clinical managed services, comprised approximately 13% of our consolidated revenue and 18% of our nursing and allied solutions segment’s revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. No other client healthcare system or single client facility comprised more than 3% of our consolidated revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. Our success in winning MSP contracts means some larger health systems have grown and may continue to grow more significantly relative to our other revenue sources. The dynamics could lead to a greater client concentration than we have historically experienced.
Our Industry

The primary markets in which we compete are U.S. temporary and contract healthcare staffing, workforce solutions and executive search. Staffing Industry Analysts (“SIA”) estimates that the segments of the target market in which we primarily operate have an aggregate 2019 estimated market size of $17 billion, of which travel nurse, per diem nurse, locum tenens and allied healthcare comprise $5.4 billion, $3.6 billion, $4.2 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. We also operate within the interim leadership, permanent placement, RPO, VMS, mid-revenue cycle management, and workforce optimization and consulting services markets. We estimate the market size of these additional segments to be at least $5 billion in 2019.
Industry Demand Drivers

Many factors affect the demand for contingent and permanent healthcare staffing, which, accordingly, affects the size of the markets in which we primarily operate. Of these many factors, we believe the following serve as some of the most significant drivers of demand.

• | Economic Environment and Employment Rate. Demand for our services is affected by growth of the U.S. economy, which influences the employment rate. Growth in real U.S. gross domestic product generally drives rising employment rates. Favorable macro drivers typically result in increased demand for our services. Generally, we believe a positive economic environment and growing employment lead to increasing demand for healthcare services. As employment levels rise, healthcare facilities, like employers in many industries, experience higher levels of employee attrition and find it increasingly difficult to obtain and retain permanent staff.


• | Supply of Healthcare Professionals. While reports differ on the existence and extent of current and future healthcare professional shortages, many regions of the United States are experiencing a shortage of physicians and nurses that we believe will persist in the future. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, the physician shortage is expected to range from 61,700 to 94,700 physicians by 2025. In nursing, geographic and specialty-based shortages are also expected through 2025. Demand for our services is positively correlated with activity in the permanent labor market. When nurse vacancy rates increase, temporary nurse staffing orders typically increase as well.


• | General Demand for Healthcare Services. Changes in demand for healthcare services, particularly at acute healthcare hospitals and inpatient facilities, affect the demand for our services. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the uninsured population declined by more than 20 million people between 2010 and 2017. Growth of the insured population contributed to a relatively sharp increase in national healthcare expenditures beginning in 2014. Additionally, the U.S. population continues to age, and medical technology advances are contributing to longer life expectancy. A pronounced shift in U.S. age demographics is expected to boost growth of health expenditures, projected by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services at a 5.6% annual rate from 2017-2025. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of adults age 65 or older is on pace to grow an estimated 36% between 2015 and 2025. People over 65 are three times more likely to have a hospital stay and twice as likely to visit a physician office compared with the rest of the population. These dynamics could place upward pressure on demand for the services we provide in the coming years. Not only does the age-demographic shift affect healthcare

5


services demand, it also complicates the supply of skilled labor, as an increasing number of clinicians are aging out of the workforce.

• | Adoption of Workforce Solutions. We believe healthcare organizations increasingly seek sophisticated, innovative and economically beneficial workforce solutions that improve patient outcomes. We believe the prevalence of workforce solutions, such as MSP, VMS, RPO and workforce optimization tools, in the healthcare industry is still underpenetrated in comparison with non-healthcare sectors. During 2018, approximately 42% of our consolidated revenues were generated through MSP relationships, which we estimate is higher than our competitors in the healthcare staffing industry. Ongoing changes in reimbursement methodologies, coupled with the significance of clinical labor in healthcare facilities’ cost structures, may accelerate the adoption of strategic outsourced workforce solutions, which could place upward pressure on demand for the services we provide.

Industry Competition
The healthcare staffing and workforce solutions industry is highly competitive. We compete in national, regional and local markets for healthcare facility clients and healthcare professionals. We believe that our size, scale and sophisticated candidate acquisition processes give us access to a larger pool of available candidates than our competitors, while substantial word-of-mouth referral networks and recognizable brand names enable us to attract, engage, and grow a diverse, high-quality network of healthcare professionals. We also believe that our comprehensive suite of workforce solutions, our commitment to quality and service excellence, our execution capabilities, our national footprint and our access to a wide network of high-quality talent create a compelling value proposition for our clients and prospective clients. We believe that our size, geographic scope, broad spectrum of workforce solutions, talented and passionate team members and brand reputation give us distinct, scalable advantages over smaller, local and regional competitors and companies whose service offerings, sales and execution capabilities are not as robust. The breadth of our services allows us to provide even greater value through a more strategic, consultative and solution-oriented approach to our clients. Larger firms, such as us, also generally have a deeper, more comprehensive infrastructure with a more established operating model and processes that provide the long-term stability and foundation for quality standards recognition, such as the Joint Commission staffing agency certification and National Committee for Quality Assurance Credentials Verification Organization certification. HRO Today named AMN Healthcare the number one position among all MSP providers in size of deals, and we also were honored in the Baker’s Dozen for quality of services, breadth of services and overall MSP capabilities. Once again, Staffing Industry Analysts recognized AMN’s U.S. industry leadership naming us as the largest temporary healthcare staffing firm, the largest travel nurse staffing provider and the largest allied healthcare staffing provider.
We are the largest provider of nurse and allied healthcare staffing in the United States. In the nurse and allied healthcare staffing business, we compete with a few national competitors together with numerous smaller, regional and local companies, particularly in the per diem business. We believe we are the third largest provider of locum tenens staffing services in the United States. The locum tenens staffing market consists of many small- to mid-sized companies with only a relatively small number of national competitors of which we are one. The physician permanent placement services and mid-revenue cycle staffing markets, where we believe we hold leading positions, are also highly fragmented and consist of many small- to mid-sized companies that do not have a national footprint. Our leading competitors vary by segment and include CHG Healthcare Services, Cross Country Healthcare, Jackson Healthcare, Aya Healthcare, Maxim Healthcare Services, Aureus Medical Group and HealthTrust Workforce Solutions. When recruiting for healthcare professionals, in addition to other executive search and staffing firms, we also compete with hospital systems that have developed their own recruitment departments.
Licensure For Our Business

Some states require state licensure for businesses that employ, assign and/or place healthcare professionals. We believe we are currently licensed in all states that require such licenses and take measures to ensure compliance with all state licensure requirements. In addition, the healthcare professionals who we employ or independently contract with are required to be individually licensed or certified under applicable state laws. We believe we take appropriate and reasonable steps to validate that our healthcare professionals possess all necessary licenses and certifications. We design our internal processes to ensure that the healthcare professionals that we directly place with clients have the appropriate experience, credentials and skills. Our travel nurse and allied healthcare staffing divisions, all of our locum tenens brands and all of our local staffing offices have received Joint Commission certification. We have also obtained our Credentials Verification Organization certification from the National Committee for Quality Assurance.
Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,920 corporate employees. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we had an average of (1) 9,404 nurses, allied and other clinical healthcare professionals, (2) 408 executive and clinical leadership 
6


interim staff, and (3) 1,238 mid-revenue cycle professionals contracted to work for us. This does not include our locum tenens, all of whom are independent contractors and not our employees.
