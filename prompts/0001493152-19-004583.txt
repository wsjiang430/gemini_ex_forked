GENERAL
 
Hemispherx Biopharma, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Hemispherx”, “Company”, “we” or “us”) are an immuno-pharma company headquartered in Ocala, Florida and focused on the research and development of therapeutics to treat multiple types of cancers, as well as immune-deficiency disorders. We have established a strong foundation of laboratory, pre-clinical and clinical data with respect to the development of nucleic acids and natural interferon to enhance the natural antiviral defense system of the human body and to aid the development of therapeutic products for the treatment of certain cancers and chronic diseases.
 
Hemispherx’s flagship products include Ampligen® (Rintatolimod), a first-in-class drug of large macromolecular RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules, and Alferon N Injection® (Interferon Alfa-N3). A first-in-class drug also known as a new chemical entity, is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by the FDA or marketed in the US.
 
Ampligen® represents an RNA being developed for globally important cancers, viral diseases and disorders of the immune system. Ampligen® has in the clinic demonstrated the potential for standalone efficacy in a number of solid tumors. We have also seen success in increasing survival rates and efficacy in the treatment of animal tumors when Ampligen® is used in combination with checkpoint blockade therapies. This success in the field of immuno-oncology has guided our focus toward the potential use of Ampligen® as a combinational therapy for the treatment of a variety of solid tumor types. There are currently multiple Ampligen® clinical trials — both underway and planned — at major cancer research centers around the country. Ampligen ® is also being used as a monotherapy to treat pancreatic cancer patients in an Early Access Program (EAP) approved by the Inspectorate of Healthcare in the Netherlands at Erasmus Medical Center.
 
Ampligen® is also being evaluated for the treatment of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Hemispherx is currently sponsoring an expanded access program (EAP) for ME/CFS patients in the U.S. In August 2016, we received approval of our NDA from Administracion Nacional de Medicamentos, Alimentos y Tecnologia Medica (ANMAT) for commercial sale of Ampligen® in the Argentine Republic for the treatment of severe CFS. With regulatory approval in Argentina, Ampligen® is the world’s only approved therapeutic for ME/CFS. We continue to pursue our Ampligen New Drug Application, or NDA, for the treatment of CFS with the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. Please see “Research And Development (“R&D”); Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (“ME/CFS”)” below.
 
Alferon N Injection® is approved for a category of STD infection and patients that are intolerant to recombinant interferon in Argentina. Alferon is the only natural-source, multi-species alpha interferon currently approved for sale in the U.S. for the intralesional treatment of refractory (resistant to other treatment) or recurring external Condylomata Acuminata/genital warts (GW) in patients 18 years of age or older. Certain types of human papilloma viruses cause GW. Hemispherx also has approval from ANMAT for the treatment of refractory patients that failed or were intolerant to treatment with recombinant interferon in Argentina. We have developed and, with proper funding, will be seeking FDA Pre-Approval Inspection of a high-volume, high-efficiency, upgraded manufacturing process to allow for the commercial viability of Alferon®.
 
We operate a 30,000 sq. ft. facility in New Brunswick, NJ with the objective of producing Ampligen® and Alferon®. We are committed to a focused business plan oriented toward finding senior co-development partners with the capital and expertise needed to commercialize the many potential therapeutic aspects of Ampligen® and our FDA-approved drug Alferon® N.

OUR PRODUCTS
 
Our primary pharmaceutical product platform consists of Ampligen®, first-in-class drug of large macromolecular double-stranded (ds) RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules and our FDA approved natural alpha-interferon product, Alferon N Injection®.
Ampligen®
 
Ampligen® is approved for sale in Argentina for severe Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and is an experimental drug in the United States currently undergoing clinical development for the treatment of certain cancers and ME/CFS. Over its developmental history, Ampligen® has received various designations, including Orphan Drug Product Designation (FDA and European Medicines Agency (“EMA”)), Treatment protocol (e.g., “Expanded Access” or “Compassionate” use authorization) with Cost Recovery Authorization (FDA) and “promising” clinical outcome recognition based on the evaluation of certain summary clinical reports (“AHRQ” or Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). Ampligen® represents the first drug in the class of large (macromolecular) dsRNA molecules to apply for NDA review. Based on the results of published, peer reviewed pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, we believe that Ampligen® may have broad-spectrum anti-viral and anti-cancer properties.
 
We believe that nucleic acid compounds represent a potential new class of pharmaceutical products designed to act at the molecular level for treatment of many human diseases. There are two forms of nucleic acids, deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) and ribonucleic acid (“RNA”). DNA is a group of naturally occurring molecules found in chromosomes, the cell’s genetic machinery. RNA is a group of naturally occurring informational molecules which orchestrate a cell’s behavior which, in turn, regulates the action of groups of cells, including the cells which compromise the body’s immune system. RNA directs the production of proteins and regulates certain cell activities including the activation of an otherwise dormant cellular defense against viruses and tumors. Our drug technology utilizes specifically-configured RNA and is a selective TLR3 agonist that is administered intravenously. Ampligen® has been assigned the generic name rintatolimod by the United States Adopted Names Council (USANC) and has the chemical designation poly(I):poly(C12U).
 
EAP/clinical trials of Ampligen® that have been conducted or that are ongoing include studies of the potential treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung, ovarian, breast, colorectal, urothelial, prostate and pancreatic cancer, CFS, Hepatitis B and HIV.
 
We have received approval of our NDA from ANMAT for commercial sale of rintatolimod (U.S. tradename: Ampligen®) in the Argentine Republic for the treatment of severe CFS. The product will be marketed by GP Pharm, our commercial partner in Latin America. Commercialization in Argentina will require, among other things, GP Pharm to establish disease awareness, medical education, creation of an appropriate reimbursement level, design of marketing strategies and completion of manufacturing preparations for launch.
 
The FDA has authorized an open-label expanded access treatment protocol, (“AMP-511”), allowing patient access to Ampligen® in an open-label safety study under which severely debilitated CFS patients have the opportunity to be on Ampligen® to treat this very serious and chronic condition. The data collected from the AMP-511 protocol through clinical sites provide safety information regarding the use of Ampligen® in patients with CFS. We are establishing an enlarged data base of clinical safety information which we believe will provide further documentation regarding the absence of autoimmune disease associated with Ampligen® treatment. We believe that continued efforts to understand existing data, and to advance the development of new data and information, will ultimately support our future filings for Ampligen® and/or the design of future clinical studies that the FDA requested in a complete response letter. The FDA recently approved the increase reimbursement level from $200 to $345 per 200mg vial of Ampligen, due to increased production costs. At this time, we do not plan on passing this adjustment along the patients in this program. As of December 31, 2018, there are 15 patients being treated in this open-label expanded access treatment protocol.
 
In May 2016, we entered into a five-year agreement with myTomorrows, a Netherlands based company, for the commencement and management of an Early Access Program (“EAP”) in Europe and Turkey (the “Territory”) related to ME/CFS. Pursuant to the agreement, as amended, myTomorrows also will manage all Early Access Programs and Special Access Programs in Europe, Canada and Turkey to treat pancreatic cancer and ME/CFS patients.
 
In April 2018, we completed data analysis of an intranasal human safety study of Ampligen® plus FluMist® known as AMP-600. The study was previously closed after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) recommended against the use of FluMist®. Intranasal Ampligen® in combination with FluMist® was generally well-tolerated in the study.

In June 2018, Ampligen® was cited as outperforming two other TLR3 agonists, poly IC and natural double stranded RNA, in creating an enhanced tumor microenvironment for checkpoint blockage therapy in the journal of Cancer Research (http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2018/05/31/0008-5472.CAN-17-3985). In a head-to-head study in explant culture models, Ampligen® activated the TLR3 pathway and promoted an accumulation of killer T cells but, unlike the other two TLR3 agonists, it did so without causing regulatory T cell (Treg) attraction. These findings were considered important because they indicate that Ampligen® selectively reprograms the tumor microenvironment by inducing the beneficial aspects of tumor inflammation (attracting killer T cells), without amplifying immune suppressive elements such as regulatory T cells. The study was conducted at the University of Pittsburgh and Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, as a part of the NIH-funded P01 CA132714 and Ovarian Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE). Based upon these findings Hemispherx and Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center expanded their existing scientific collaboration to advance the clinical development of Ampligen® which has shown promise in preclinical studies when combined with checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs). The parties executed a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) designed to further assess the clinical potential of Ampligen® in treating certain cancers. This phase I/II study will evaluate the potential of Ampligen® to enhance the immune mediated effects of CPIs in patients with advanced solid tumors including bladder, melanoma and renal cell carcinoma.
 
In 2018, we also reported that we completed production of two commercial-size batches of more than 16,000 vials of Ampligen®, following its “Fill & Finish” at the Contract Manufacturing Organization. These lots passed all required testing for regulatory release for human use and are being used for multiple programs including the product launch in Argentina, for the treatment of ME/CFS, the pancreatic cancer EAP in the Netherlands, ongoing and future clinical studies in oncology, and our ME/CFS EAP in the U.S. and Europe.
 
Alferon N Injection®
 
Alferon N Injection® is the registered trademark for our injectable formulation of natural alpha interferon. Alferon® is the only natural-source, multi-species alpha interferon currently approved for sale in the U.S. and Argentina for the intralesional (within lesions) treatment of refractory (resistant to other treatment) or recurring external genital warts in patients 18 years of age or older. Alferon® is also approved in Argentina for the treatment of refractory patients that failed or were intolerant to treatment with recombinant interferons. Certain types of human papilloma viruses (“HPV”) cause genital warts, a sexually transmitted disease (“STD”). According to the CDC, HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection, with approximately 79 million Americans — most in their late teens and early 20s — infected with HPV. In fact, the CDC states that “HPV is so common that nearly all sexually active men and women get the virus at some point in their lives.” Although they do not usually result in death, genital warts commonly recur, causing significant morbidity and entail substantial health care costs.
 
Interferons are a group of proteins produced and secreted by cells to combat diseases. Researchers have identified four major classes of human interferon: alpha, beta, gamma and omega. Alferon N Injection® contains a multi-species form of alpha interferon. The world-wide market for injectable alpha interferon-based products has experienced rapid growth and various alpha interferon injectable products are approved for many major medical uses worldwide. Alpha interferons are manufactured commercially in three ways: by genetic engineering, by cell culture, and from human white blood cells. All three of these types of alpha interferon are or were approved for commercial sale in the U.S. Our natural alpha interferon is produced from human white blood cells.
 
The potential advantages of natural alpha interferon over recombinant (synthetic) interferon produced and marketed by other pharmaceutical firms may be based upon their respective molecular compositions. Natural alpha interferon is composed of a family of proteins containing many molecular species of interferon. In contrast, commercial recombinant alpha interferon products each contain only a single species. Researchers have reported that the various species of interferons may have differing antiviral activity depending upon the type of virus. Natural alpha interferon presents a broad complement of species, which we believe may account for its higher activity in laboratory studies. Natural alpha interferon is also glycosylated (partially covered with sugar molecules). Such glycosylation is not present on the currently U.S. marketed recombinant alpha interferons. We believe that the absence of glycosylation may be, in part, responsible for the production of interferon-neutralizing antibodies seen in patients treated with recombinant alpha interferon. Although cell culture-derived interferon is also composed of multiple glycosylated alpha interferon species, the types and relative quantity of these species are different from our natural alpha interferon.
 
Alferon N Injection® [Interferon alfa-n3 (human leukocyte derived)] is a highly purified, natural-source, glycosylated, multi-species alpha interferon product. There are essentially no neutralizing antibodies observed against Alferon N Injection® to date and the product has a relatively low side-effect profile. The recombinant DNA derived alpha interferon formulations have been reported to have decreased effectiveness after one year of treatment, probably due to neutralizing antibody formation.
 
See “Manufacturing” and “Marketing/Distribution” sections below for more details on the manufacture and marketing/distribution of Alferon N Injection®.

PATENTS AND NON-PATENT EXCLUSIVITY RIGHTS
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 57 patents worldwide with 6 additional pending patent applications comprising our intellectual property. Please see “Note 5: Patents, Trademark Rights and Other Intangibles (FASB ASC 350 General Intangibles Other than Goodwill)” under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on these patents. We continually review our patents’ rights to determine whether they have continuing value.
 
In 2016, we received a new Ampligen® composition of matter patent in the US (#9,315,538). In 2015, we were granted a new composition of matter patent (#2340307) by the European Patent Office and we received twenty-eight new patents in various EU countries. In 2014, we were granted a new composition of matter patent in the United States (#8722874) covering Ampligen® formulations.
 
The Ampligen® U.S. CFS treatment patent (#6130206) expired October 10, 2017 (we believe that the expiration of this patent will have minimal impact on us; see details on U.S. #9315538, U.S. #8722874 and information on the FDA has granted “orphan drug status” to the drug for CFS below). Our U.S. Ampligen® Trademark (#73617687) has been renewed through December 6, 2028. New therapeutic use patent applications are pending. On May 13, 2014, the United States Patent Office issued patent U.S. #8722874 titled “Double-Stranded Ribonucleic Acids with Rugged Physiochemical Structure and Highly Specific Biologic Activity,” with all rights assigned to Hemispherx. The patent claims a novel form of rugged dsRNA. Rugged dsRNA are nucleic acids with a unique composition and physical characteristic identified with high specificity of binding to Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR3), thereby conveying an important range of therapeutic opportunities. The newly discovered form of dsRNA has increased bioactivity and binding affinity to the TLR 3 receptor because of its reduced tendency to form branched dsRNA which can inhibit receptor binding. Pharmaceutical formulations containing the newly discovered nucleic acid as active ingredients and methods of treatment with those formulations are also described in the issued patent. Hemispherx believes that the issuance of U.S. Patents #9315538 and #8722874 will help ensure that Hemispherx retains patent protection for novel formulations of Ampligen® products until at least 2029.
 
In September 2015, the European Patent Office granted the European version of U.S. Patent #9315538, with all rights assigned to Hemispherx.
 
In addition to our patent rights relating to Ampligen®, the FDA has granted “orphan drug status” to the drug for CFS, HIV/AIDS, renal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma. Orphan drug status grants us protection against the potential subsequent approval of other sponsors’ versions of the drug for these uses for a period of seven years following FDA approval of Ampligen® for each of these designated uses. The first NDA approval for Ampligen® as a new chemical entity will also qualify for four or five years of non-patent exclusivity during which abbreviated new drug applications seeking approval to market generic versions of the drug cannot be submitted to the FDA. (See “Government Regulation” below.)
 
In May 2011, a new United States Patent #7943147 was granted for the use of Ampligen® as a vaccine adjuvant for use with seasonal influenza vaccine to induce an enhanced immune response against H5N1 avian influenza.
 
With respect to Alferon®, the composition is a complex mixture of natural interferon species that is manufactured from human leukocytes obtained from human blood donors. In addition, while it is the current standard by the FDA to treat biological drug products like interferon as “Well Characterized” biologics, a process for which chemical entities can have their identity, purity, impurities, potency, and quality controlled by chemical testing, Alferon®, as a natural interferon, does not lend itself well to such testing. Moreover, FDA continues to require that each lot of Alferon® we produce be tested and released by the FDA before it can be distributed for commercial sales. Because of the complexity of the Alferon® manufacturing process and these additional regulatory requirements, we believe that potential manufacturers of generic, or so-called “bio-similar,” drug products are focused on developing recombinant interferon products, rather than natural interferon products. For these reasons, we believe that not having patent protection should have no or little impact on the Company. Additionally, at the receipt of the FDA certification for the revised Alferon® manufacturing process and techniques in New Brunswick, NJ, it is our intention to file for additional patent protection.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (“R&D”)
 
Our general focus during the past two fiscal years has been on the clinical development of new drug therapies based on natural immune system enhancing technologies for the treatment of immune-based disorders including cancer and CFS.
Cancer
 
We have been working with the University of Pittsburgh’s chemokine modulation research initiative which includes the use of Ampligen® as a potential adjuvant to modify the tumor microenvironment (TME) with the goal of increasing anti-tumor responses to check point inhibitors (CPI). As part of this collaboration, Hemispherx has supplied Ampligen® (rintatolimod) to the University. The study, under the leadership of Robert P. Edwards, MD, chair of gynecologic services at Magee-Women’s Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and Professor of Surgery Pawel Kalinski, M.D., Ph.D., at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, N.Y., involved the chemokine modulatory regimen developed by Dr. Kalinski’s group and successfully completed the Phase 1 dose escalation in patients with resectable colorectal cancer. In the 1st quarter of 2017, Dr. Kalinski relocated to Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center (“RPCCC”) in Buffalo, NY and has established a cancer program which will continue to require a supply of Ampligen®.

In October 2018, we signed a clinical trial agreement with Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center to evaluate Ampligen® in combination with checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs). The Phase IIa clinical trial will evaluate the immune-mediated effects of cytokine modulation in combination with CPIs in patients with primary resistance to CPI therapy. The protocol will seek to evaluate the combination of Ampligen® and CPIs in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. Ampligen® is our investigational immune-enhancing TLR3 agonist that has demonstrated a robust anti-cancer effect in preclinical models when combined with CPIs. This new agreement expands the extensive prior clinical and preclinical work into the clinical checkpoint blockade arena and offers the opportunity to begin evaluation of this combination therapy in patients with a variety of solid tumors where large numbers of patients do not respond or progress following treatment with standard CPI-based therapy.
 
Currently, four Ampligen® clinical trials are underway at university cancer centers testing whether tumor microenvironments can be reprogrammed to increase the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy, including checkpoint inhibitors:
 
Recurrent Ovarian Cancer - Phase 1 / 2 study of intraperitoneal chemo-immunotherapy in recurrent ovarian cancer at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Dr. R. Edwards, PI. Study underway. An interim report from Dr. Edwards’ team is expected within thirty days and a summary of same will be disclosed upon receipt. See: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02432378
 
Colorectal Cancer - Phase 2a study of Ampligen as component of chemokine modulatory regimen on colorectal cancer metastatic to liver at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. Dr. P. Boland, PI. Study underway. See: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03403634
 
Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer - Open label study of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer using chemokine modulation therapy, including Ampligen and pembrolizumab, at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. Dr. M. Opyrchal, PI. Initiation of study is expected in the near future and will be announced forthwith. See: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03599453
 
Recurrent Ovarian Cancer – This is a Phase 2 investigator-sponsored trial being conducted in advanced recurrent ovarian cancer at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center that will evaluate Ampligen in combination with pembrolizumab. Patient enrollment has been initiated in this study designed for 45 subjects. Dr. Robert Edwards, world renowned expert in ovarian cancer is the lead investigator. For more important details see: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03734692
 
In addition, five Ampligen clinical trials are planned for initiation in 2019, subject to funding:
 

● | Phase 2 study that will evaluate Ampligen in combination with pembrolizumab in refractory metastatic colorectal carcinoma at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. Dr. P. Boland, PI. Study design and budget being developed. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2 study of advanced urothelial (bladder), melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, resistant to checkpoint blockade, that will evaluate Ampligen in combination with a checkpoint blockade therapy at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. Dr. M. Opyrchal, PI. Protocol design currently being finalized. Hemispherx Biopharma signed a clinical trial agreement with Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center to study Ampligen in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in a phase 2a study in urothelial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. This Phase 2a study will be led by Mateusz Opyrchal, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Associate Director of the Early Phase Clinical Trial Program at Roswell Park, in collaboration with Dr. Kalinski.

Based upon success in the initial animal studies, an additional round of more extensive and comprehensive pre-clinical animal pancreatic cancer studies are being conducted at University of Nebraska to reconfirm results, test additional PC tumor types, examine anti-PD-1 in addition to the prior anti-PD-L1 analysis, then fine tune the focus of the proposed future pancreatic cancer clinical trial and reduce the chances of error in clinical trial design. This information will also be used to formulate proposed future combination therapy clinical activity in the Kingdom of the Netherlands. 
● | Phase 2 study of neoadjuvant conditioning of prostate cancer using Ampligen as a component of chemokine modulation at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. Dr. G. Chatta, PI. This protocol is under review by the FDA.

In January 2017, the EAP through our agreement with myTomorrows designed to enable access of Ampligen® to ME/CFS patients had been extended to pancreatic cancer patients beginning in the Netherlands. myTomorrows is our exclusive service provider in Europe and Turkey and will manage all EAP activities relating to the pancreatic cancer extension of the program. In February 2018, the agreement with myTomorrows was extended to cover Canada to treat pancreatic cancer patients, pending government approval.
 
As of December 31, 2018, 40 pancreatic cancer patients have received treatment with Ampligen® immuno-oncology therapy under the EAP program at Erasmus University in the Netherlands.
 
Supervised by Prof. Casper van Eijck, MD, a world-renowned specialist in this dread malignancy, and Diba Latifi, MD, the team at Erasmus is making progress. As disclosed recently, the Dutch government has approved and extended the therapeutic program for an additional year. Early progress was reported in a published abstract from Erasmus, and a copy of the abstract can be found at http://ir.hemispherx.net/Events_Presentations. The abstract was part of a larger original report covering a variety of medical topics, which can be found at https://www.pancreasclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Poster-Abstracts.pdf.
 
As of today, we are pleased to report that four out of 24 patients with either locally advanced or metastatic disease have survived for more than one year on the Ampligen protocol without additional therapy. Another four patients have survived for more than one year since the start of the Ampligen protocol with palliative chemotherapy. However, in this group of patients 15 died within seven months since start of Ampligen. Of the five resected patients two died on Ampligen, 24 and 27 months after resection. The other three patients are still alive with a mean survival of 26 months after resection and adjuvant Ampligen treatment.
 
All patients reported improvement in quality of life during treatment. We expect within 60 days a more comprehensive update from the Erasmus team on the immunological response in relation to survival. Hemispherx hopes to work with Dr. Van Eijck, Dr. Latifi, and Erasmus M.C. to initiate a combination therapy program to extend the results seen thus far in the Netherlands by combining Ampligen with checkpoint blockade therapy.
 
Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (“ME/CFS”)
 
Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (“ME/CFS”), also known as Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (“CFIDS”) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (“CFS”), is a serious and debilitating chronic illness and a major public health problem. ME/CFS is recognized by both the government and private sector as a significant unmet medical need, including the U.S. National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), FDA and the CDC. The CDC states on its website at https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/ that “Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a serious, long-term illness that affects many body systems. People with ME/CFS are often not able to do their usual activities. At times, ME/CFS may confine them to bed. People with ME/CFS have severe fatigue and sleep problems. ME/CFS may get worse after people with the illness try to do as much as they want or need to do. This symptom is known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). Other symptoms can include problems with thinking and concentrating, pain, and dizziness.”
 
Many severe ME/CFS patients become completely disabled or totally bedridden and are afflicted with severe pain and mental confusion even at rest. ME/CFS is characterized by incapacitating fatigue with profound exhaustion and extremely poor stamina, sleep difficulties and problems with concentration and short-term memory. It is also accompanied by flu-like symptoms, pain in the joints and muscles, tender lymph nodes, sore throat and new headaches. A distinctive characteristic of the illness is a worsening of symptoms following physical or mental exertion, which do not subside with rest.
 
In October 2016, an analysis of a subset of CFS patients from the AMP-516 Phase 3 study was performed and presented at the IACFS/ME annual meeting in Fort Lauderdale, FL. The ITT Population (n=208) was separated into two subsets based primarily on baseline CFS symptom duration (2-8 years (n=75) and <2 years plus >8 years (n=133)). Responder analyses of the ITT Population and both subsets were performed. Responder analyses of rintatolimod vs. placebo patients improving ET duration from baseline by ≥25% shows over twice the % of patients with clinical enhancement in ET effect in the rintatolimod cohort compared to placebo for the 2-8 year subset vs. the ITT population. This subset may assist in the design of future clinical studies of Ampligen® in the treatment for ME/CFS patients.

Other Diseases
 
In Europe, the EMA has approved the Orphan Medicinal Products Designation for rintatolimod (Ampligen®) as a potential treatment of Ebola virus disease and for Alferon® N Injection, also known as interferon alfa-n3, as a potential treatment of MERS.
 
We concluded our series of collaborations designed to determine the potential effectiveness of Ampligen® and Alferon® N as potential preventative and/or therapeutic treatments for Ebola related disorders. Although we believe that the threat of both MERS and Ebola globally may reemerge in the future, it appears that the spread of these disorders has somewhat diminished. As a result, we have elected to focus our research and development efforts on other areas at this time.
 
MANUFACTURING
 
In January 2017, Hemispherx approved a quote and provided a purchase order commitment with Jubilant Hollister-Stier LLC (“Jubilant”) pursuant to which Jubilant will manufacture commercial size batches of Ampligen®. Additional orders will be placed upon approved quotes and purchase orders provided by Hemispherx to Jubilant. Jubilant was approved by the FDA as a manufacture of Ampligen by the successful completion of a previous preapproval inspection by the agency. The National Administration of Drugs, Food and Medical Devices (A.N.M.A.T) in Argentina has approved Ampligen for commercial distribution for the treatment of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). Shipment of the drug product to Argentina was initiated in 2018 to complete the release testing by A.N.M.A.T. needed for commercial distribution.
 
Since the commencement of the 2017 commitment between Jubilant and Hemispherx, two lots of Ampligen consisting of more than 16,000 units have been manufactured and released. The first lot was designated for human use in the US in the cost recovery CFS program and for expanded oncology clinical trials. The second lot has been designated for these programs in addition to commercial distribution in Argentina for the treatment of CFS. Additional lots of Ampligen are being planned for manufacture at Jubilant. The production of additional polymer (Ampligen intermediates) at our New Brunswick facility is required to produce the additional lots of Ampligen. Polymer manufacture is on schedule to provide the intermediates needed for the Ampligen manufacture planned at Jubilant
 
Alferon® is approved by the FDA for commercial sales in the US for the treatment of genital warts. It is also approved by A.N.M.A.T in Argentina for commercial sales for the treatment of genital warts and in patients refractory to treatment with recombinant interferons. While the Hemispherx facility in New Brunswick is approved by the FDA under the Biologic License Application (BLA) for Alferon®, this status will need to be reaffirmed by an FDA pre-approval inspection which will not occur until new batches of commercial filled and finished product are produced and released by the FDA. Currently, the manufacturing process is on hold and there is no definitive timetable to have the facility back online until additional funding is obtained.
 
Licensing/Collaborations/Joint Ventures
 
To maximize the availability of Ampligen® to patients on a worldwide basis, we have embarked on a strategy to license the product and/or to collaborate and/or create a joint venture with companies that have the demonstrated capabilities and commitment to successfully gain approval and commercialize Ampligen® in their respective territories of the world. Ideal partners would have the following characteristics: well established global and regional experience and coverage, robust commercial infrastructure, strong track record of successful development and registration of in-licensed products, as well as a therapeutic area fit (ME/CFS, immuno-oncology, etc.).
 
MARKETING/DISTRIBUTION
 
In May 2016, we entered into a five-year exclusive Renewed Sales, Marketing, Distribution and Supply Agreement (the “Agreement”) with GP Pharm. Under this Agreement, GP Pharm was responsible for gaining regulatory approval in Argentina for Ampligen® to treat severe CFS in Argentina and for commercializing Ampligen® for this indication in Argentina. We granted GP Pharm the right to expand rights to sell this experimental therapeutic into other Latin America countries based upon GP Pharm achieving certain performance milestones. We also granted GP Pharm an option to market Alferon N Injection® in Argentina and other Latin America countries.
 
In January 2017, the ANMAT granted a five-year extension to a previous approval to sell and distribute Alferon N Injection® (under the brand name “Naturaferon”) in Argentina. This extends the approval until 2022. In February 2013, we received the ANMAT approval for the treatment of refractory patients that failed or were intolerant to treatment with recombinant interferon, with Naturaferon® in Argentina.

In May 2016, we entered into a five-year agreement (the “Impatients Agreement”) with Impatients, N.V. (“myTomorrows”), a Netherlands based company, for the commencement and management of an EAP in Europe and Turkey (the “Territory”) related to ME/CFS. Pursuant to the agreement, myTomorrows, as our exclusive service provider and distributor in the Territory, is performing EAP activities. These activities will be directed to (a) the education of physicians and patients regarding the possibility of early access to innovative medical treatments not yet the subject of a Marketing Authorization (regulatory approval) through named-patient use, compassionate use, expanded access and hospital exemption, (b) patient and physician outreach related to a patient-physician platform, (c) the securing of Early Access Approvals (exemptions and/or waivers required by regulatory authorities for medical treatments prior to Marketing Authorization) for the use of such treatments, (d) the distribution and sale of such treatments pursuant to such Early Access Approvals, (e) pharmacovigilance (drug safety) activities and/or (f) the collection of data such as patient-reported outcomes, doctor-reported experiences and registry data. We are supporting these efforts and supplying Ampligen® to myTomorrows at a predetermined transfer price. In the event that we receive Marketing Authorization in any country in the Territory, we will pay myTomorrows a royalty on products sold. Pursuant to the Impatients Agreement, the royalty would be a percentage of Net Sales (as defined in the Impatients Agreement) of Ampligen® sold in the Territory where Marketing Authorization was obtained, and the maximum royalty would be a percentage of Net Sales. The formula to determine the percentage of Net Sales will be based on the number of patients that are entered into the EAP. The Company believes that disclosure of the exact maximum royalty rate and royalty termination date could cause competitive harm. However, to assist the public in gauging these terms, the actual maximum royalty rate is somewhere between 2% and 10% and the royalty termination date is somewhere between five and fifteen years from the First Commercial Sale of a product within a specific country. The parties established a Joint Steering Committee comprised of representatives of both parties to oversee the EAP. No assurance can be given that activities under the EAP will result in Marketing Authorization or the sale of substantial amounts of Ampligen® in the Territory.
 
In January 2017, the EAP through our agreement with myTomorrows designed to enable access of Ampligen® to ME/CFS patients has been extended to pancreatic cancer patients beginning in the Netherlands. myTomorrows is our exclusive service provider in the Territory and will manage all EAP activities relating to the pancreatic cancer extension of the program.
 
In February 2018, we signed an amendment to the EAP with myTomorrows. This amendment extended the territory to cover Canada to treat pancreatic cancer patients, pending government approval.
 
In March 2018, we signed an amendment to the EAP with myTomorrows, pursuant to which myTomorrows will be our exclusive service provider for special access activities in Canada for the supply of Ampligen® for the treatment of ME/CFS.
 
In August 2017, we extended our agreement with Asembia, formerly Armada Healthcare, LLC, to undertake the marketing, education and sales of Alferon N Injection® throughout the United States.
 
COMPETITION
 
The major pharmaceutical competitors for Ampligen include Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck & Co., Novartis and AstraZeneca. Biotech competitors include Baxter International, Fletcher/CSI, AVANT Immunotherapeutics, AVI BioPharma and Genta. When we recommence sales of Alferon N Injection®, it will compete with Intron® A, an injectable from Merck & Co.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and foreign countries is and will be a significant factor in the manufacture and marketing of Alferon® products and our ongoing research and product development activities. Ampligen® and other products developed from the ongoing research and product development activities will require regulatory clearances prior to commercialization. In particular, new drug products for humans are subject to rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing as a condition for clearance by the FDA and by similar authorities in foreign countries. The process of seeking these approvals, and the ongoing process of compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, has and will continue to require the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us or our collaborators or licensees to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect the marketing of any products developed by us and our ability to receive product or royalty revenue. We have received Orphan Drug designation for certain therapeutic indications, which we believe might under certain conditions help to accelerate the process of drug development and commercialization. Alferon N Injection® is only approved for use in intralesional treatment of refractory or recurring external genital warts in patients 18 years of age or older. Use of Alferon N Injection® for other applications requires regulatory approval.
 
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to such matters as safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals and the use of and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research work. Prior to our construction phase, our laboratory and production facility in New Brunswick, New Jersey was approved for the manufacture of Alferon N Injection®. While our facility had been granted approval of its BLA by the FDA for the manufacture of Alferon®, this status will need to be reaffirmed as we have completed the facility’s enhancements and believe, with adequate funding, it will again be able to obtain FDA approval.
