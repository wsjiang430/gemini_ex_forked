ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
RenovoRx is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a vision to disrupt the current paradigm of cancer treatment. Our mission is to lead a revolution in oncology therapy by delivering its innovative and targeted intra-arterial (IA) delivery of chemotherapy directly to solid tumors. The proprietary RenovoRx Trans-Arterial Micro-Perfusion (RenovoTAMP®) therapy platform aims to avoid the harsh side effects typical of the current standard of care, or systemic delivery methods, thus improving patient well-being and, potentially extension of life, so more time may be enjoyed with loved ones. RenovoTAMP utilizes approved chemotherapeutics with validated mechanisms of action and well-established safety and clinical use, with the goal of improving their safety, tolerance, and widening their therapeutic window by providing more targeted delivery at the location of the tumor tissue. RenovoRx’s lead product candidate, RenovoGemTM, is a combination of gemcitabine and its patented delivery system, RenovoCath®. The FDA has determined that RenovoGem will be regulated as, and if approved we expect will be reimbursed as, a new oncology drug product. We have secured FDA Orphan Drug Designation for RenovoGem in two rare diseases: pancreatic cancer and cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer, or eCCA). We have completed the first of two planned interim analyses of the ongoing open label Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial. TIGeR-PaC is a randomized multi-center Phase III open label clinical trial designed to investigate the Company’s first product candidate, RenovoGem, which utilizes RenovoRx’s proprietary therapy platform, RenovoTAMP, to provide targeted intra-arterial delivery of FDA-approved chemotherapy, gemcitabine, to treat locally advanced pancreatic cancer (“LAPC”) following stereotactic body radiation therapy (“SBRT”). The study is comparing treatment with RenovoGem versus standard of care treatment. In this interim analysis, the control and treatment arms demonstrated divergence in median overall survival for patients. The study is designed to randomize 114 patients (57 in each arm) with all patients receiving upfront induction chemotherapy and SBRT. This first of two planned interim analysis occurred upon the discovery of the 26th event (death) which equates to 30% of the total events required (96) for the final analysis. The TIGeR-PaC Data Monitoring Committee (“DMC”) met and determined the interim data warrants continuation of this pivotal trial without modification and no safety concerns were observed. The interim analysis shows a 6-month median overall survival benefit for patients: approximately a 60% improvement versus the study control arm and current standard of care: intravenous (IV) administration of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel for - LAPC. RenovoGem patients also had greater than 65% reduction in adverse events. These can include nausea, fatigue, and a decline in white blood cells.

● | Twenty-three patients were randomized to intra-arterial gemcitabine (RenovoGem investigational treatment) arm and 22 to continuation of IV gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (standard of care control) arm. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The median overall survival in the IV gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel control arm was 10 months, versus 16 months in the intra-arterial RenovoGem arm from time of randomization. (NOTE: Both arms’ median overall survival calculations do not include 4 to 5-months of life from diagnosis to randomization during the induction chemotherapy and radiation phase of the trial). 
● | Observed a positive trend in median overall survival by 24-weeks (6 months); in this interim analysis, the statistical significance was not reached to stop the study early (p=0.051). 
● | Observed that patients had greater than 65% reduction in adverse events compared to the control arm: In the IV gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel control arm there were 11 reported Serious Adverse Events (out of 22 patients) vs. 4 reported Serious Adverse Events (out of 23) intra-arterial RenovoGem patients.

The second planned interim analysis of this Phase III trial will be performed upon the 52nd event (death) which equates to 60% of the total events required for the final analysis and is estimated to take place in mid-2024; however, given that it is predicated on the number of deaths in the study, it is difficult to predict the exact timing. We intend to evaluate RenovoGem in a second indication in a Phase II/III trial in extrahepatic (or outside the liver) cholangiocarcinoma (or eCCA), cancer that occurs in the bile ducts that lead out of the liver and join with the gallbladder. We are in the process of incorporating the recently approved and adopted drug, durvalumab, into the protocol and launching the study mid this year. In addition, we may evaluate RenovoGem in other indications, potentially including locally advanced lung cancer, locally advanced uterine tumors, and glioblastoma (an aggressive type of cancer that can occur in the brain or spinal cord). To date, we are focused on developing drug/device candidates with gemcitabine, but we continue to explore the development of other product candidates with additional therapeutic agents in new clinical indications for intra-arterial delivery via our RenovoTAMP therapy platform via in-licensing, generic sourcing, and/or strategic partnering.
 
Our RenovoTAMP therapy platform is focused on optimizing drug concentration in solid tumors using approved small molecule chemotherapeutics. Our platform enables physicians to isolate segments of the vascular anatomy closest to tumors and force chemotherapy across the blood vessel wall to bathe these difficult-to-reach solid tumors in chemotherapy. Specifically, our patented approach allows physicians to combine, on the one hand, pre-treatment of the local blood vessels and tissue with standard-of-care radiation therapy to decrease chemotherapy washout and, on the other hand, local delivery via our patented RenovoCath delivery system which utilizes pressure to force small molecule chemotherapy into the tumor tissue. We believe there are many advantages to our RenovoTAMP therapy platform, including:
 

● | Application of Approved Small Molecule Chemotherapeutic Agents: We use approved small molecule chemotherapeutic agents, such as gemcitabine, with well-known safety and efficacy profiles. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Targeted Approach: In a preclinical study using our therapy platform, we demonstrated up to 100 times higher local drug concentration compared to systemic chemotherapy. We believe our RenovoTAMP therapy platform allows for a targeted approach that can decrease systemic exposure and improve patient outcomes. 
● | Delivery Method Independent of Tumor Vascularity: Our therapy platform is designed to deliver small molecule chemotherapeutic agents to solid tumors resistant to systemic chemotherapy due to lack of tumor feeder blood vessels. If approved, our product candidates have the potential to treat tumors that are not directly supported by blood vessels. 
● | Broad Application for Solid Tumor Indications: Our therapy platform is not restricted to a single small molecule chemotherapeutic agent or solid tumor type. As such, it may be applied for use in additional solid tumor indications, including in solid tumors without identifiable tumor feeder blood vessels.

Research and Development Pipeline
 
Our portfolio of cancer therapies is based on our lead product candidate, RenovoGem (gemcitabine delivered via our patented delivery system), regulated by the FDA as a novel oncology drug product. RenovoGem utilizes pressure-mediated delivery of gemcitabine across the arterial wall to bathe tumor tissue in chemotherapy. RenovoGem, via the RenovoTAMP (RenovoRx Trans-Arterial Micro-Perfusion) therapy platform, is currently being evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial in Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer (LAPC). Our current pipeline is summarized below:
RenovoGem Product Pipeline Addresses Multiple Indications
 

Figure 2: RenovoGem Clinical Pipeline detailing our potential portfolio of cancer therapies based on our RenovoTAMP therapy platform.
 
Gemcitabine has been considered a standard of care drug for several solid tumors, and the drug’s anti-cancer tumor effects are well profiled. Our RenovoTAMP platform therapy utilizes pressure mediated delivery of gemcitabine across the arterial wall to bathe the pancreatic tumor tissue in 120 mL of saline with 1,000 mg/m2 of the drug over a 20-minute delivery period (delivering 1,500-2,000 mg of drug depending upon patient body surface area). Our delivery system, RenovoCath, is a double balloon catheter designed with the capability to isolate sections of the blood vessel through the adjustment of the distance between the balloons, thereby excluding any branching blood vessel offshoots in order to create the pressure head needed to push drug across the blood vessel wall.
 
We intend to explore applications of our RenovoTAMP platform in additional indications, including bile duct cancer, locally advanced lung cancer, locally advanced uterine cancer, and glioblastoma. We have completed and presented data on a lung cancer application in preclinical studies, and additional preclinical experiments in lung cancer may be conducted.
 
We are using gemcitabine in our initial anti-cancer product candidate, RenovoGem. However, multiple small molecule therapeutics are compatible with our RenovoTAMP platform. We intend to opportunistically develop additional anti-cancer product candidates using small molecule therapeutics in combination with our therapy platform.
 
While the field of oncology has seen progress in treating a handful of deadly cancers over the last few decades, there is a common objective in chemotherapy: enhanced dosing of the drug to impact the tumor while minimizing systemic toxicity. The characteristics of the blood vessels, within and surrounding the tumor, can limit or thwart the achievement of this goal. For example, LAPC and eCCA are more difficult to treat due to the lack of blood vessels that feed these tumors, making it difficult to expose tumors to chemotherapy, which is typically delivered intravenously. Trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an established first line therapy for solid tumors. A key component of this approach is to identify and isolate vessels feeding the tumor, known as tumor feeder blood vessels. However, in patients with pancreatic cancer, no tumor feeder blood vessels are visible despite attempts to image them using a variety of modalities. In the absence of visible tumor feeder blood vessels, our therapy platform has the potential to introduce drugs directly across the arterial wall into the surrounding tissue via pressurized diffusion.

RenovoGem in Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer (LAPC)
 
In December 2021, we amended the protocol for this clinical trial to only allow for SBRT during the induction phase of the study (prior to randomization). We had previously permitted both SBRT and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (“IMRT”). Patients receiving IMRT must complete 25 radiation treatments in combination with oral chemotherapy during the induction phase of the study, which takes between 35 and 56 days to complete. In comparison, patients receiving SBRT during the induction phase are only required to complete 5 treatments, over 5 consecutive days, and do not receive oral chemotherapy. The decision to modify the study population was based on the observation in the Phase III TIGeR-PaC study that IMRT patients had a higher dropout rate during the induction phase of the study due to the high frequency of hospital visits and side effects from the required concurrent chemotherapy. As part of the pre-randomization, induction phase change made to the protocol, we initiated a review of the statistical considerations for the study and in June 2022, submitted a modified Statistical Analysis Plan (the “Modified SAP”) to FDA. As part of the Modified SAP, we now plan to (i) analyze only patients receiving SBRT, consistent with the protocol change made in December 2021, (ii) include a second interim analysis, (iii) change the total number of SBRT patients randomized in the study to 114 (a reduction from the original 200 patients) with a total of 86 deaths from SBRT patients, including all deaths from SBRT patients enrolled in the study before the submission of the Modified SAP, and (iv) repower the study from 90% to 80%, which is commonly used in clinical trials. We believe these changes will shorten the timeframe needed to complete the study and also significantly decrease our costs. We have not discussed the protocol amendment or the Modified SAP with the FDA, and we cannot provide any assurance that the FDA will agree with these modifications. The first planned interim analysis was triggered when 30%, or 26 of 86, of the total number of deaths occurred (and announced in March 2023), and the second interim analysis at 60%, or 52 of 86, of the total number of deaths have occurred and is estimated to be mid-2024. Given that the timing of the interim analysis is predicated on a specific number of deaths, it is difficult to predict the exact timing of the interim analysis or when we will be able to complete the study. As of March 20, 2023, the Phase III TIGeR-PaC trial has randomized 48 SBRT patients out of 114 total needed under the Modified SAP. At this rate, we anticipate that all patients will be enrolled and randomized in 2024, with the final study readout in 2025.
 
RenovoGem in Extrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma (eCCA)
 
We are also planning to evaluate RenovoGem in a second indication in a Phase II/III trial in extrahepatic (or outside the liver) cholangiocarcinoma (or eCCA), cancer that occurs in the bile ducts that lead out of the liver and join with the gallbladder. After significant input from key opinion leaders across the spectrum of relevant medical specialties and feedback from the FDA, we submitted the protocol for a Phase II/III eCCA clinical trial to FDA, and after receiving feedback, we are finalizing the protocol and also including incorporating a recently approved drug, durvalumab into the study protocol with guidance from the Steering Committee. We anticipate launching this study mid this year. We have also secured FDA Orphan Drug Designation for RenovoGem for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma, which would provide us with seven years of orphan exclusivity to market RenovoGem for our eCCA indication upon NDA approval, provided that we are the first sponsor to obtain FDA approval for intra-arterial gemcitabine for the eCCA indication.

Current Treatments and Limitations of Approaches
 
Currently, solid tumors are typically treated using one or a combination of treatment modalities: surgery, radiation, and pharmacological therapies (chemotherapy). For solid tumors, when possible, surgical resection of the tumor is the most frequently employed treatment approach. If the tumor is detected at an early stage and is localized to the affected organ, surgical removal of the entire tumor may be an effective and potentially curative treatment. In most cases, surgery is undertaken and / or completed prior to commencing additional treatment approaches. However, multiple solid tumor types, including LAPC and eCCA are diagnosed at advanced stages, which precludes surgery as a treatment approach. In many of these circumstances, the tumor has grown into adjacent anatomical structures making surgery difficult or impossible.
 
Intravenous (IV), or systemic chemotherapy (gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel), which has a seven-week survival benefit is considered standard of care for most solid tumors, but limitations include less than acceptable efficacy, systemic toxicities, and other side effects.
 
For the treatment of some localized solid tumors, TACE is an established first line therapy. Many companies have developed therapeutic products for use in this approach to treat tumors of the liver, uterus, and prostate. Many solid tumors have a dedicated blood supply: small blood vessels, called tumor feeder blood vessels, that branch off of larger native arteries and terminate in the tumors to provide nutrition to the tumors. A key aspect of TACE is to identify and isolate these tumor feeder blood vessels during x-ray angiography and then deliver the desired therapy including chemotherapy and embolic agents. In patients with LAPC, no tumor feeder blood vessels are visible during angiography due to the avascular (lack of blood vessels) nature of these tumors. This limitation has rendered TACE ineffective in the treatment of patients with LAPC, eCCA, and a subset of other solid tumors. The limitations of TACE translate to low survival rates in these tumor subtypes. The use of TACE with or without immuno-oncology treatment approaches, which harness the body’s immune system to treat cancer, has not significantly improved survival rates in these subtypes. For example, due to the inability of immune cells to penetrate the tumor tissue, early studies of targeted immunotherapies in pancreatic cancer have demonstrated limited success.
 
Our Platform: RenovoTAMP
 
RenovoTAMP may work best with avascular tumors
 
Certain tumor types are sufficiently vascularized to enable use of systemic chemotherapy and standard of care local therapy techniques. In Figure 2 below, for example, the panel on the left depicts visualization of an actual tumor, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or primary liver cancer, under x-ray angiography as dye injected through the arteries reaches the tumor itself. Further, visible tumor feeder blood vessels can be reached by simple end-hole catheters to deliver targeted therapy to these liver tumors. In contrast, the panel on the right illustrates the typical lack of tumor feeder blood vessels to a pancreatic tumor. Given the lack of tumor feeder blood vessels, the dye does not reach the tumor, rendering the tumor “invisible” under x-ray angiography.

Tumors in Liver are Different from Hypovascular Tumors in the Pancreas
 

Figure 3: Showing liver tumors that are highly vascularized, and pancreatic tumors that are avascular. 
 
RenovoTAMP has been under development for over 14 years
 
In 2009, our founder Dr. Ramtin Agah, an experienced interventional cardiologist with a degree in biomedical engineering, developed the concept for RenovoTAMP as a way to deliver chemotherapy locally to treat poorly vascularized tumors. He joined forces with Kamran Najmabadi, who brought significant medical device engineering experience, to found RenovoRx in 2009. Subsequently, we engaged a contract manufacturer to prototype and manufacture our RenovoCath delivery devices. We received our first FDA 510(k) clearance for RenovoCath in 2014, a second clearance to use the RenovoCath for infusion of chemotherapy agents in 2017, a further clearance to use RenovoCath with a power-injector in 2019, and a fourth clearance in 2021 to expand vessel diameter range to 3-11mm, implement certain changes in the Instructions for Use, change the recommended saline to contrast solution ratio, among other changes and improvements. RenovoCath is intended for the isolation of blood flow and delivery of fluids, including diagnostic and/or therapeutic agents, to selected sites in the peripheral vascular system. RenovoCath is also indicated for temporary vessel occlusion in applications including arteriography, preoperative occlusion, and chemotherapeutic drug infusion. RenovoCath is intended for general intravascular use in the peripheral vasculature in arteries 3 mm and larger as well as for use in arteries from 3 mm in diameter for vessel entry and to occlude vessels ranging between 3 mm to 11 mm in diameter. We are evaluating our lead product candidate RenovoGem under an IND filed in 2018. FDA has determined that RenovoGem will be regulated as, and if approved we expect will be reimbursed as, a new oncology drug product.
 
How it works: we developed RenovoTAMP as an attempt to solve the problems of treating avascular tumors
 
To overcome the limitations resulting from a lack of tumor feeder blood vessels, we explored a different approach to locally deliver anti-cancer drugs. By isolating a section of the blood vessel and then increasing the intravascular pressure in the isolated segment, we can introduce chemotherapy directly across the arterial wall into the surrounding tissue via pressurized diffusion, or Trans-Arterial Micro-Perfusion (RenovoTAMP). To isolate the vessel and create this pressure gradient, we developed RenovoCath, a patented adjustable double balloon catheter to occlude the proximal and distal part of the vessel. Using the RenovoTAMP technique in explanted (dissected out of the animal and used separately in a saline water bath) pig aorta and iliac arteries, we were able to validate our hypothesis by demonstrating >99% gemcitabine pressurized diffusion across the arterial wall in the absence of feeder vessels. This mechanism of action was further supported by exploratory acute animal studies measuring the pressure gradient within the artery during double balloon occlusion. Figure 3 demonstrates the change in intra-arterial pressure over time from catheter introduction to balloon inflation, start of infusion, and pressure plateau when chemotherapy is forced out of vessel. These changes in pressure are a result of pressure declining as the first balloon blocks blood inflow and then rising as the drug is administered and fills up the space between the balloons.

In procedures developed for the RenovoTAMP platform, interventional radiologists utilize RenovoCath to pressurize an isolated vessel segment.
 

Figure 4: Occluding the vessel with RenovoCath, while adjusting the balloon-to-balloon distance to exclude all blood vessel branches, established an intravascular interstitial pressure in the isolated blood vessel segment of approximately 20 mmHg. With subsequent infusion of fluids between the balloons at 6 mls/minute, the intravascular pressure increases to above 45 mmHg, trans-arterially forcing the small molecule drug across the arterial wall via diffusion (this patented process of perfusing the vessel wall is Trans Arterial Micro Perfusion, or RenovoTAMP).
 
Our RenovoTAMP platform therapy utilizes pressure mediated delivery of gemcitabine across the arterial wall to bathe the pancreatic tumor tissue in 120 mL of saline with 1,000 mg/m2 of drug over a 20-minute delivery period (delivering 1,500 - 2,000 mg of drug depending upon patient body surface area. This blanketing approach of large fluid volume delivery over time may enable the drug to approach these difficult-to-reach tumors. 
 
Some advantages of RenovoTAMP include:
 

● | Ideal for solid tumors where resection is not possible due to proximity/impingement of tumor on blood vessels, nerves, or other key structures 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | No need for identifying tumor feeder blood vessels to deliver the drug. These generally do not exist in avascular or hypovascular tumors such as LAPC and eCCA 
● | In solid tumors without identifiable feeder vessels, technically easier than direct cannulation of small tumor feeder blood vessels 
● | High local concentration of drug into the tumor tissue 
● | Potential for decreased systemic exposure of drug due to local metabolism prior to systemic exposure 

 
Developing a therapeutic platform using an adjustable two-balloon catheter and intra-arterial gemcitabine
 
By isolating the vessel adjacent to the tumor and creating a pressure gradient across the arterial wall between the isolated vessel segment and the surrounding tissue or tumor, we are able to force the small molecule chemotherapy across the vessel directly into surrounding tissue or tumor. To accomplish this, we needed a minimally invasive technique to isolate the blood vessel next to the tumor, exclude any branches that can cause washout of chemotherapy away from the target, and then infuse the chemotherapy into the isolated segment to achieve pressure mediated diffusion through the vessel wall and into the tumor tissue. We accomplished this with our patented RenovoCath delivery system. RenovoCath is a double balloon catheter designed with the capability to isolate the proximal and distal sections of the vessel through the adjustment of the distance between the balloons, thereby excluding any branching blood vessel offshoots. Using standard interventional techniques, an interventional radiologist inserts the RenovoCath delivery system into the body through the femoral artery and positions it in the artery closest to the tumor. Once the balloons are inflated and the position is confirmed, chemotherapy is delivered through the handle, exiting the device between the balloons. It is forced through the vessel wall into the tissue over a 20-minute period. The RenovoCath delivery system is depicted below in Figure 4.

After the procedure is complete, RenovoCath is discarded, and the patient is generally discharged the same day. On average, the entire procedure takes approximately 90 minutes. According to the TIGeR-PaC study protocol, intra-arterial treatment is administered through RenovoCath every other week for a maximum of 8 treatments for approximately 16 weeks. Interventional radiologists using the device are typically proctored for their first 2-3 cases only. In addition, platform training for our primary indication should transfer to other indications.
 
RenovoGem for LAPC
 
Disease Overview
 
Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers in the US with very poor outcomes. According to American Cancer Society’s Cancer Facts & Figures 2023, pancreatic cancer has a 5-year combined overall survival rate of 12% (Stages I-IV) and is on track to be the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths before 2030. LAPC is diagnosed when the disease has not spread far beyond pancreas, however, has advanced to the point where it cannot be surgically removed. LAPC is typically associated with patients in stage 3 of the disease as determined by the TNM (tumor, nodes and metastasis) grading system.
Current Treatment Landscape and Limitations
 
Pancreatic cancer has limited treatment options including one or a combination of surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and/or some targeted therapies. Only a small subset of pancreatic cancer patients is eligible for surgery (“Resectable” at the time of presentation (Stage I-II: 15%); the rest are distributed between having tumors with unresectable LAPC (Stage III: 30%) and metastatic pancreatic cancer (Stage IV: 50%).
 
Chemotherapy is at the forefront of systemic therapy for cancer. It can be used in the neoadjuvant (before surgery) setting to attempt to decrease tumor size in resectable or borderline resectable patients, in the adjuvant (after surgery) setting, or first line in the metastatic/advanced setting. The backbone of our first product candidate, gemcitabine, is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor that exhibits antitumor activity by blocking the synthesis of new DNA, which results in cell death. Gemcitabine administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion has an established role in the treatment of both unresectable LAPC and metastatic pancreatic cancer. Since its introduction in the US as Gemzar® (gemcitabine for injection) in 1996 with an FDA approved indication as such, it remains in the guidelines as standard of care. It has been demonstrated to provide clinical benefit for subjects (decreased pain and improved performance status) as well as to improve the time to tumor progression and survival for subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer and LAPC. However, major improvement in the survival curve of all pancreatic cancer subjects has been a clinical challenge, with an average median survival time for LAPC stalled at 12-15 months from time of diagnosis.
 
A key limitation of conventional chemotherapy in these tumors can be attributed to their avascular nature and desmoplasia (fibrosis or the growth of scar tissue) that impedes drug delivery. Pancreatic tumor cells have a thick and poorly perfused stroma, or connective tissue, and high interstitial pressure. This can potentially constrict blood vessels leading to an avascular or hypovascular environment that impedes chemotherapy from reaching tumor cells in high enough volume, rendering them relatively resistant to chemotherapy.

In patients with metastatic disease, two chemotherapy combination regimens have shown superiority to gemcitabine, albeit with increased toxicity. First, the combination of oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFIRINOX) in a relatively young cohort of metastatic pancreatic cancer patients appears superior to gemcitabine by improving survival from 6.8 to 11.1 months. Second, in the Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Clinical Trial (MPACT) trial, the combination of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) demonstrated an OS benefit of 9 weeks versus gemcitabine alone at the cost of increased toxicity.
 
A major focus of clinicians is determining the optimal method to treat patients with LAPC, patients with localized disease who are not surgical candidates, roughly 30% of all pancreatic cancer patients. IV, or systemic, administration of chemotherapy has yielded unsatisfactory results in these patients. Various localized treatments have included high dose local radiation, direct attempts at local injection of drugs, and use of adenoviral vectors to deliver toxic agents. These treatment options demonstrated limited success in the treatment of LAPC. The lack of successful treatment options represents a recognized unmet medical need for these patients.
 
Standard of care chemotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer has historically shifted a couple of times with the addition of erlotinib to gemcitabine 15 years ago resulting in a 14-day survival benefit. In 2013, the addition of Abraxane to gemcitabine was approved, with immediate deep market penetration based on an 8-week survival benefit despite higher systemic drug toxicities.
 
Our Solution
 
We believe that our product candidate, RenovoGem, has the potential to address the recognized unmet medical need. Utilizing our patented RenovoTAMP therapy platform, we believe RenovoGem can enhance local drug concentration, thereby increasing efficacy and decreasing systemic exposure and toxicity to improve patient outcomes. RenovoGem is a drug/device combination product candidate consisting of intra-arterial gemcitabine and our proprietary RenovoCath delivery system which forces the anti-cancer drug into the tumor. RenovoGem is regulated by the FDA as a new oncology drug product. We do not intend to sell RenovoCath alone. Instead, we intend to sell RenovoCath only in combination with intra-arterial gemcitabine (as RenovoGem) or potentially with other therapeutic agents.
 
Based on primary market research and analysis of the US market sponsored by RenovoRx and conducted by third parties, we believe that over 5,000 patients per year would be excellent candidates and undergo RenovoGem treatment once it is approved in the US. The independent oncologists interviewed stated their dissatisfaction with current standard of care and the strong desire for a therapy like ours to extend potential survival while maintaining quality of life. Further, the analysis suggests, based on analogous oncology drugs with only a modest efficacy benefit, a novel drug can expect 50-80%+ penetration in a first line setting. The results of the Key Opinion Leader, or KOL interviews revealed that a majority of oncologists would refer 90%+ of their LAPC patients who are eligible for the procedure for RenovoTAMP if the current Phase III trial demonstrates at least a 4-month survival benefit over systemic chemotherapy. As of March 8, 2023, we announced interim analysis results of the study suggesting a 6-month potential improvement in median overall survival with RenovoGem, pending ongoing clinical investigation. We believe this first-of-two interim analyses indicates that the TIGeR-PaC study is on track to demonstrate increased lifespan for patients being treated with RenovoGem for LAPC.
 
RenovoTAMP Therapy Platform and First Product Candidate, RenovoGem
 

Figure 6: We invented a new therapy platform, RenovoTAMP, that uses pressure to force small molecule chemotherapeutics across the vessel wall into the surrounding tissue using our patented RenovoCath delivery system. Our first product candidate, RenovoGem, is a drug/device combination of intra-arterial gemcitabine and the RenovoCath delivery system, and is under development for LAPC and eCCA. We have secured Orphan Drug Designations for RenovoGem for the treatment of both pancreatic cancer and cholangiocarcinoma.
 
Clinical Development of RenovoGem in LAPC
 
Preclinical Studies and Data
 
Once RenovoCath is introduced via standard interventional technique to the arterial vessel segment next to the targeted tissue, both balloons are inflated, and the vessel segment is isolated from the rest of the circulatory system. With inflation of balloons, the pressure is observed to drop within the vessel. However, with infusion of fluids between the balloons, the intravascular pressure increases beyond 45 mmHg until plateauing, generating a gradient and trans-arterially forcing the infusate across the arterial wall via diffusion or Trans-Arterial Micro-Perfusion (TAMP). A key aspect of this approach is to adjust the distance between the balloons to exclude any side blood vessel branches in the isolated segment to allow the increase in pressure gradient, rather than drug washout via the side branches. Figure 6 shows a comparison, in an animal study, between proper balloon positioning with no side branches, allowing maximum drug to cross the arterial wall, versus improper balloon positioning to include side branches, resulting in drug washing out via the side branches.

Infusion Pressure Achieved When Side Blood Vessel Branches Are Excluded
 

Figure 7: Top panel demonstrates proper balloon positioning with no side branch. Pressure increases with infusion and reaches a plateau of approximately 75 mmHg higher than initial pressure. Bottom panel demonstrates improper balloon positioning with side branch between the balloons. Pressure increases with infusion and reaches a plateau of approximately only 15mmHg higher than initial pressure.
 
With diffusion of fluids across the arterial wall in RenovoTAMP, we expected to be able to deliver small molecules into the surrounding tissue. We performed the following studies to validate this hypothesis:

In explanted (dissected out of the animal and used separately in a saline water bath) pig iliac and aortic artery, with the introduction of RenovoCath and infusion of gemcitabine in the isolated vessel segment, we were able to measure (in a time dependent fashion) the amount of gemcitabine crossing the arterial wall into the surrounding fluid. We isolated the arterial vessel segment using RenovoCath and then delivered 60 mg/minute of gemcitabine into the isolated area over 20 minutes. By the end of the infusion, we measured 1,188 mg of gemcitabine in the surrounding fluid around the vessel and 9 mg in the analyzed tissue of the vessel. This demonstrated that 99% of the drug crosses the arterial wall and only 0.75% is retained in the arterial tissue (Figure 7).

In a Preclinical Study - 99% of Chemotherapy Crosses Arterial Wall with RenovoTAMP Delivery
 

Figure 8: RenovoTAMP: delivery of chemotherapy through the RenovoCath and into the tissue to bathe the tumor in chemotherapy. In a preclinical study using gemcitabine, 99% of the drug crosses the arterial wall and less than 0.75% is retained in the vessel wall tissue.

2) | Infusion of gemcitabine via RenovoTAMP has demonstrated vascular safety with acceptable toxicity in a pig model and does not cause loss of vessel integrity or inflammation. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Six pigs were treated with gemcitabine via RenovoTAMP (6 mL/min for 20 minutes). Target vessels included selection of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and splenic arteries from each animal (either test or saline control). A total of 6 vessels (3 SFA and 3 splenic arteries) were treated with an equal number of control vessels. All animals survived the 7-day in-life period although two of the animals with gemcitabine treatment in the splenic artery experienced atypical pain during the post-operative phase and required additional pain management with eventual complete recovery.
 
Analysis of the vessels demonstrated preserved vessel shape with intact endothelial cells (cells on the inside of the vessels). Minimal to no inflammation was observed. The only vessel toxicity observed was a reduction of smooth muscles cells in the vessel wall, primarily close to the inside of the vessel.
 

3) | In preclinical studies, RenovoTAMP achieved targeted local drug (dye) delivery. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
I. Targeted small molecule delivery (dye) into pancreatic tissue
 
We further validated our approach for tissue drug delivery using acute animal experiments. Using both dye and gemcitabine infusion via the RenovoTAMP therapy, we were able to demonstrate that fully isolating a segment of a vessel (by blocking inflow and outflow in the target vessel as well as side branches with the RenovoCath double balloons) can lead to dye penetration greater than 4.0 cm from the vessel wall and drug tissue concentration (gemcitabine) up to 100-fold greater than systemic administration.
 
In an acute pig experiment, RenovoCath was introduced into the gastro-duodenal artery (GDA), a side branch was excluded (using small implants that block the artery, coils), and then dye was introduced at 6mls/minute over 2 minutes. Analysis demonstrated that the blue dye diffused covered approximately 10.56 cm2 (2.2 cm x 4.8 cm) of the pancreas.

Dye Demonstrates RenovoTAMP Delivery of Agent into Pancreatic Tissue


Figure 9: RenovoCath was introduced into the GDA and a side branch was excluded by coiling. This test was conducted in an acute porcine model and demonstrated a dye coverage area of approximately 10.56 cm2 for a 2-minute dye infusion. All dimensions in above figure are in cm.
 
The study was repeated in 6 other vessel targets to validate the impact of vessel isolation on dye penetration into the surrounding tissue with similar results.
 
II. Small molecule delivery (dye and gemcitabine) locally into lung tissue
 
In another set of acute animal experiments, the pulmonary artery was isolated via access through the internal jugular vein. Six ml of methylene blue dye was injected over 1 min and gemcitabine was subsequently delivered locally at rate of 6 mls/minute for 20 minutes to the lung tissue using the RenovoTAMP procedure.
 
Dense dye staining localized to the area of the isolated vessel segment was observed. Again, analysis established penetration into surrounding tissue (4 cm). Furthermore, RenovoTAMP achieved greater than 100-fold tissue concentration of gemcitabine versus the tissue level achieved by IV (systemic) delivery of gemcitabine at the same infusion rate.
 
Dye Staining Demonstrates RenovoTAMP Delivery of Agent to Lung Tissue
 

Figure 10: Dense dye staining localized to the area of the isolated pulmonary artery segment and penetrating 4 cm into surrounding tissue following 1 minute dye infusion. In addition, gemcitabine was delivered via RenovoTAMP for 20 minutes demonstrating 100-fold increase in tissue concentration of gemcitabine compared to IV delivery of gemcitabine at the same infusion rate.

We concluded that RenovoTAMP can achieve drug penetration into the surrounding tissue and can achieve high dose concentrations in local tissue. The tissue concentration with intravenous infusion and/or distant from RenovoTAMP site (likely after recirculation through systemic system) were two orders of magnitude lower than tissue levels achieved with RenovoTAMP (p<0.02).
 
RenovoTAMP Increases Local Tissue Concentration of Gemcitabine Compared to IV Infusion
 

Figure 11: Local tissue concentration of gemcitabine. control (Blue): Intravenous infusion versus RenovoTAMP (Orange): RenovoTAMP: intra-arterial infusion. The tissue concentration with intravenous infusion and/or distant from RenovoTAMP site (likely after recirculation through systemic system) are 100-fold lower than tissue levels achieved with RenovoTAMP.
 
This animal lung study successfully validated the ability of RenovoCath to deliver small molecules locally and effectively to lung tissue.
 
III. Based on the results of preclinical studies, increase in local tissue delivery of gemcitabine in LAPC may enhance tumor reduction and therapeutic response
 
In relevant mouse models of pancreatic tumors, it has been demonstrated that targeted intra-arterial (IA) infusion of gemcitabine into the pancreas after surgical isolation of arterial blood flow has a superior therapeutic effect with greater reduction in tumor volume compared to the same concentration administered by conventional systemic (intravenous) injection. To achieve a comparable reduction in tumor growth as seen with IA treatment, gemcitabine had to be given intravenously at over 300 times the dose which was associated with increased toxicity.
 
RenovoTAMP and Radiation
 
Traditionally the goal of radiation includes debulking the tumor and/or acting as a chemo-sensitizer. In our RR1 dose escalation safety study and RR2 observational registry study, the benefit of RenovoTAMP appeared to be enhanced in patients with prior radiation. As we were observing this effect months after radiation and although several randomized studies have not demonstrated a benefit of chemotherapy + radiation versus chemotherapy alone, we hypothesized that a direct effect of radiation on the vasculature may be enhancing the effect of RenovoTAMP. One of the side effects of radiation is a decrease in the micro-vasculature in the irradiated tissue including the small blood vessels that exist in the vessel walls themselves. Therefore, we postulated that by eliminating microvasculature in and around the vessel wall, radiation may enhance drug penetration into the tissue via RenovoTAMP (Figure 11). As such, a possible enhancing effect of radiation on RenovoTAMP may involve decreasing washout of the drug as it crosses the arterial wall by preventing draining into the surrounding microvasculature.
 
We completed a pig study where we observed the impact of RenovoTAMP in recruiting the vasa vasorum (small blood vessels within the larger blood vessel walls) around the vessel during drug/dye infusion. It was discovered that the dye drained into the vasa vasorum and other small vessels in the adjacent tissue (Figure 11); as these vessels can directly connect to the adjacent venous system, the microvascular networks can serve as an “escape route” for drugs. Ultimately this direct washout can reduce the amount of drug concentration in the tissue. Radiation pretreatment may enhance the impact of RenovoTAMP by attenuating this escape route.
 
RenovoTAMP Combined with Radiation Reduces Venous Outflow by Decreasing the Microvasculature
 

Figure 12: Mechanism of RenovoTAMP and radiation reduces venous outflow by decreasing the microvasculature networks that could act as an “escape route” for the drugs. The photo on the left illustrates this effect in a dye infusion study in the porcine animal model. The panel on the right demonstrates venous chemotherapy washout without radiation versus less venous escape routes for chemotherapy following radiation.
 
We further advanced this theory by conducting a pig study to directly test whether radiation can enhance tissue uptake by RenovoTAMP. In a single-animal study, we examined the use of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) pre-treatment on one leg followed by RenovoTAMP versus RenovoTAMP without prior radiation therapy on the opposite leg. The leg of the animal that was pre-treated with radiation demonstrated more pronounced tissue staining with methylene blue dye and increased gemcitabine concentration via punch biopsy. Based on these findings, we believe that the benefit of prior radiation on clinical outcomes with RenovoTAMP may be improved by the effect of radiation on microvasculature between the vessel wall and the tumor.

Dye Test Demonstrates that RenovoTAMP Plus Radiation Increases Concentration of Gemcitabine


Figure 13: To demonstrate the effect of radiation pre-treatment, we delivered radiation therapy to the left leg of a pig. After waiting one month for the therapy to fully affect the vasculature, we performed RenovoTAMP on the left and right leg arteries with blue dye and gemcitabine. Dissection revealed better dye penetration into the tissue on the left (irradiated) leg, and punch biopsy demonstrated higher gemcitabine concentration in the left leg.
 
We have demonstrated that the RenovoTAMP therapy allows targeted small molecule drug delivery into the tissue surrounding the vessel wall, without need to identify tumor feeder blood vessels. The mechanism of action is the exclusion of distal (downstream) and side branch vessels in the isolated segment and creating a pressure gradient by infusing the drug over time. The pressure gradient results in a diffusion-mediated delivery of drug into the surrounding tissue. With the use of gemcitabine, the procedure appears safe in terms of local toxicity in the vasculature. Using this approach, we can achieve increased drug delivery into the surrounding tissue in the range of 4 cm-tissue penetration as well as concentration orders of magnitude larger than what can be achieved with IV infusion. Lastly, RenovoTAMP appears to be enhanced by prior radiation of tissue, possibly by decreasing the microvasculature and subsequent potential chemotherapy washout.

LAPC Clinical Development
 
RenovoTAMP has been studied in a Phase I/II dose-ranging study of 20 subjects with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (RR1) and in an observational study that enrolled 25 additional subjects with pancreatic cancer (RR2); two subjects from the RR1 safety study continued to receive treatment in the RR2 observational registry study. We subsequently launched a Phase III registration trial (TIGeR-PaC). As of March 8, 2023, we announced interim analysis results of the study suggesting a 6-month potential improvement in median overall survival with RenovoGem, pending ongoing clinical investigation. We believe this first-of-two interim analyses indicates that the TIGeR-PaC study is on track to demonstrate increased lifespan for patients being treated with RenovoGem for LAPC. Final analysis will be conducted after 86 protocol-specified events have occurred in the SBRT population with two planned interim analyses: this first analysis with 30% of the specified events (deaths) reported and the second analysis when 60% of the events have been reported (expected in 2024).
 
Phase I/II Dose-Ranging Study: RR1
 
Study Design
 
A Phase I/II safety study of our RenovoTAMP therapy has been completed in subjects with LAPC (Phase I/II RenovoCath/Gem RR1). This multicenter, prospective, open label, interventional, nonrandomized, intra-subject dose escalation study evaluated IA gemcitabine delivered locally to the pancreas using RenovoCath in 20 subjects with LAPC. The primary objectives of the study were (1) to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and (2) to study the safety and tolerability of intra-arterial (IA) gemcitabine administered by RenovoCath at doses ranging from 250 mg/m2 to 1000 mg/m2. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, CA 19-9 marker change, change in tumor size based on RECIST 1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria, and pain scores and narcotic use. Adverse events were collected from the first IA gemcitabine infusion until 3 months following the final IA gemcitabine infusion. Subjects were followed for survival.
 
Treatment constituted introducing RenovoCath to target vessel (adjacent to tumor) via catheterization, occluding the targeted segments via the RenovoCath balloons, and infusing gemcitabine in the occluded segment. To minimize ischemia (damage due to cessation of blood flow) the infusion was limited to 20 minutes and an anticoagulant (heparin) was given during the procedure. Tissue markers were followed post procedure to ensure lack of local tissue damage-toxicity (AST, ALT, Lipase and Amylase).
 
Treatment was administered in four 28-day cycles, each of which consisted of two IA doses of gemcitabine, one on day 1 and one on day 15, with a two-week rest period between cycles. The first six subjects received a starting dose of 250 mg/m2, and doses increased by 250 mg/m2 in each subsequent cycle culminating with the full dose of 1,000 mg/m2. After the initial six subjects, the starting dose increased to 500 mg/m2 for one cycle, after which dosing increased to 750 mg/m2 for the second cycle, and then the full 1,000 mg/m2 dose for the remaining 2 cycles. Each subject underwent CT scanning prior to the first procedure for the selection of the optimal target vessel most proximal to the tumor.
 
Study Subjects and RenovoGem Exposure
 
The median age of subjects was 66.7 years with a gender distribution of 9 men and 11 women. Prior treatment included chemotherapy and radiation therapy in 6 (30%), chemotherapy alone in 5 (25%) and no prior therapy in 9 (45%) subjects. Collectively the 20-subject cohort received 101 IA treatments. It is important to note that 9 of the 20 subjects had a biliary stent or drain in place before the first IA procedure.
 
Trial Results
 
Safety
 
There was no evidence of local tissue toxicity in any patients post procedure as measured by liver and pancreatic enzymes. Out of 101 procedures, adverse events were reported in 11 subjects, including catheterization/procedure-related events with arterial dissections at treatment sites (3), pseudoaneurysm in a visceral artery (1), complications away from the treatment site and site complications (2).
 
Serious adverse events were reported in 9 subjects during the study. Overall survival (including deaths that occurred following disease progression) was followed in all study subjects. The number of subjects with serious adverse events is shown in Table 1 below.

This table shows serious adverse events reported in 9 of the 20 subjects during the study. Several subjects had more than one serious adverse event.
 
Efficacy
 
The principal evaluation of efficacy was survival. All subjects were followed for survival after the end of IA gemcitabine treatment. All subjects have died, with the longest having an overall survival of 35.9 months.
Subjects Who Received More Intra-arterial Treatment Cycles Survived Longer
 

Figure 14: This chart shows survival as a function of total number of IA treatment cycles received. Subjects receiving all 4 cycles (n=8) had a median survival time of 21.7 months, compared to a median survival time of 10.9 months for all subjects (n=20).

Subjects Who Received Greater Cumulative Exposure to RenovoGem Survived Longer
 

Figure 15: Splitting the entire cohort into equal tertiles based on total dose received, patients receiving the lowest total dose (<2.5g/m2; n=7) demonstrated the lowest median overall survival (8.1 months) compared to patients in the group receiving the next higher total dose (>2.5g/m2, but <4g/m2; n=6; median OS=10.9 months), and patients in the group receiving the highest total dose (>4g/m2; n=7; median OS=27.5 months).
Subjects Who Had Prior Radiation Exposure Survived Longer Than Those Who Did Not
 
As shown below in Figure 15, fifteen subjects received more than 1 cycle of intra-arterial gemcitabine treatment. The red line represents subjects without any prior treatment or received prior chemotherapy only (n=10; median OS=13.6 months). The dark green line depicts subjects who received prior chemoradiation (n=5; median OS=28.2 months). P < 0.05 for survival between the two subsets. Survival appeared to be longer in subjects who had prior chemoradiation.

Disease Progression Based on RECIST 1.1 Criteria
 
The RECIST 1.1 criteria was used to compare the baseline and follow up CT images submitted by sites. Follow-up CT scans obtained 5 months after initiation of IA gemcitabine therapy were submitted for 17 of the 20 subjects and were compared to the baseline images. Six of the 17 subjects (35.3%) experienced tumor progression, 1 (5.9%) had a partial response, and 10 (58.8%) demonstrated stable disease 5 months post treatment initiation. Two of the 6 subjects with tumor progression received less than 1 cycle (only 1 treatment) of IA gemcitabine. Among 15 subjects who received more than 1 cycle (2 treatments), 26.7% had disease progression, 6.7% had partial response and 66.7% had stable disease 5 months post IA therapy.
CA 19-9 Tumor Marker Change
 
CA19-9 is a protein that can be detected in serum and is a biomarker of pancreatic cancer; its levels can be used to assess tumor response to therapy. Twelve of 20 subjects had measurable CA 19-9 tumor markers. The final CA 19-9 tumor marker levels were lower in 7 of 12 (58%) and greater in 5 of 12 (42%) subjects. It is notable that final tumor marker levels were lower in 4 of 5 subjects with prior chemoradiation and higher in 5 of 7 subjects without prior chemoradiation.
Observational Registry Study RR2
 
We launched the RR2 observational registry study in January 2016 to further explore the clinical utility of the RenovoTAMP procedure. The key inclusion criteria were patients with locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma confirmed by histology or cytology. This was an observational patient registry study with endpoints of safety and survival following intra-arterial gemcitabine treatment with RenovoCath. The study was conducted at 7 sites in the US and subsequently closed on August 2019 except for one US site (that did not participate in the Phase III study). This last site in the study was officially closed in September 2020. Over the 3 years that the trial was open, we enrolled 25 subjects with LAPC. Two of those subjects had participated in our Phase I/II RenovoCath/Gem RR1 trial: each received 8 IA gemcitabine infusions prior to enrollment in the RR2 study. A summary of data updated through January 2021 is presented below.
 
The study initially enrolled LAPC subjects without regard to prior radiation or chemotherapy. In April 2017, after the observation of longer survival of subjects with prior chemoradiation versus subjects who had not had prior radiotherapy, entry into the registry was restricted to subjects with LAPC who had received prior radiation. Of note, one subject who had prior pancreatic cancer surgery (Whipple procedure) would not normally have been enrolled in the study but was included for safety observations as her physician had previously planned IA gemcitabine therapy.
 
Investigators in the study reported all Serious Adverse Events from the first IA gemcitabine infusion to at least 60 days after their last procedure, but reporting of non-serious adverse events was optional. All subjects received gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 every two weeks, except one who received 500 mg/m2, typically for a total of 8 doses. Subjects were followed post-treatment for survival.
 
Study Subjects and RenovoGem Exposure
 
Twenty-five subjects were enrolled at 7 sites. The study enrolled 15 women (60%) and 10 men (40%); with a mean and median age of 73. Of the 25, 10 (40%) had no prior therapy, 8 (32%) had prior radiotherapy and chemotherapy, 6 (24%) had prior chemotherapy alone and 1 (4.5%) had surgery (Whipple procedure).
 
Two subjects were continuations from the previous Phase I/II RenovoCath/Gem RR1 study, and as a result, received more than eight treatments (total in both studies). The treatment received summary is shown in Table 2:
 
Table 2 Dosing Treatments for RR2 Observational Registry Study, for 25 Subjects Enrolled at 7 Sites

>8 | 2/25 (8%) 

 
Twenty-five subjects, 15 women (60%) and 10 men (40%); with a mean and median age of 73 were enrolled at 7 sites. Of 25, 10 (40%) had no prior therapy, 8 (32%) had radiotherapy and chemotherapy, 6 had chemotherapy alone and 1 (4.5%) had surgery (Whipple procedure).
 
In the 25 patients, 109 total IA treatments were administered through one or more of the following arteries:
 

● | Common Hepatic Artery 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Splenic Artery 
● | Celiac Axis 
● | Superior Mesenteric Artery 

Trial Results
 
Safety
 
There were a number of adverse events reported. The most common were nausea (36%), vomiting (28%), abdominal pain (32%), followed by vascular access complications (16%). The less common adverse events reported (< 5%) included rash, allergic reaction, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, sepsis, ischemic bowel, arterial spasm, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, back pain, hypoglycemia, pruritis, and other GI issues. No deaths were noted in the immediate post-treatment period. No deaths were considered related to study treatment. Survival is summarized as an efficacy evaluation.

Summary of Key Safety Observations
 

● | Neither pancreatitis nor local tissue toxicity was reported in LAPC subjects without prior surgery. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | There was no instance of arterial dissection in this study. 
● | The incidence of sepsis was lower in this study (1/25 subjects receiving 94 infusions) compared with the incidence in Phase I/II RenovoCath/Gem RR1 (3/20 subjects receiving 101 infusions). The subject with sepsis did not have a biliary stent or drain and the source of the sepsis was not identified. No sepsis events were noted after 51 infusions in 12 subjects with biliary stents, who received peri-procedure antibiotics. The incidence of sepsis in the RR2 observational registry is like that of pancreatic cancer subjects receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapeutic regiment in other studies. 

Efficacy
 
Excluding the subjects with prior or post pancreatic cancer surgery, median survival (n=22) from the time of first IA gemcitabine treatment was 5.43 months, as illustrated in Figure 16 below, whereas median overall survival (from date of diagnosis) was 13.0 months (Figure 17).

In summary, the results of the RR2 observational registry build on the findings of the Phase I/II RenovoCath/Gem RR1 study. The use of RenovoCath in this patient population can be undertaken with adequate safety, with adequate attention to procedural technique including careful use/manipulation of a guide catheter to prevent arterial dissection, and with the administration of peri-procedure antibiotics in patients with prior biliary stent/drain.

RR1 and RR2 Conclusions
 
Patients with LAPC treated with RenovoTAMP showed efficacy signals:
 

● | Survival of patients with LAPC following RenovoTAMP was similar to that observed in the previous Phase I/II RenovoCath/Gem RR1 study. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Patients with biliary stents or drains who received RenovoTAMP who received prophylactic peri-procedure antibiotics experienced no episodes of sepsis. 
● | LAPC patients who received prior radiation and chemotherapy had longer survival than those without prior radiotherapy. 
● | In the RR2 observational registry study, treatment via the Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA) showed the greatest survival benefit. It is believed that this is a result of the high contact area between the SMA and the tumor tissue. 
● | The registry study (RR2) results combined with the Phase I dose escalation study (RR1) further validates prior radiation and treatment location as predictors of overall survival (in combination, RR1 and RR2 data were statistically significant for these two variables). 

 
Based on the FDA’s safety review of our Phase I/II study and clinical outcome, the FDA allowed us to proceed to evaluate RenovoGem within our Phase III registrational clinical trial.
 
TIGeR-PaC Phase III Trial (RR3)
 
With completion of RR1 and RR2, we obtained FDA approval for Phase III IND study in February 2018 comparing RenovoTAMP with intra-arterial gemcitabine to standard of care. In the FDA pre-IND meeting, the FDA confirmed the study design and endpoints and indicated that this Phase III study should result in New Drug Application approval if successful. In April 2018, we obtained Orphan Drug Designation for the use of RenovoGem in patients with pancreatic cancer. Depending on the progress of the trial and the potential observed benefit of RenovoGem, we will evaluate submitting a request to the FDA for Breakthrough Therapy Designation.
 
The primary endpoint of the study is overall survival, from time of randomization until death. Secondary endpoints include but not limited to progression free survival and quality of life questionnaire results. The study is a multi-center, open-label, randomized active-controlled study of subjects with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma which is unresectable according to NCCN guidelines. The study is currently enrolling patients in the US.
 
The study design is as follows: all patients receive a four-month induction phase of IV chemotherapy and radiation prior to randomizing to 4 cycles (8 treatments) of RenovoTAMP or 4 cycles of continuation of IV chemotherapy. In December 2021, we amended the protocol for our Phase III clinical trial to only allow for Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) radiation during the induction phase of the study. We had previously permitted both SBRT and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Patients receiving IMRT were required to complete 25 treatments prior to being randomized into our study. In comparison, patients receiving SBRT are only required to complete 5 treatments. IMRT is generally less tolerable than SBRT, and we had observed a higher drop out for patients on IMRT. While RenovoTAMP data versus historical controls predicts a much greater survival benefit, the TIGeR-PaC study is powered to detect a 6-month survival benefit.
 
A study flowchart is shown below. Subjects with stable or responding disease after approximately 4 months in induction therapy and who are not surgical candidates will then be randomized 1:1.

TIGeR-PaC Study Flowchart with Chemoradiation Induction Phase
 

Figure 20: TIGeR-PaC Study Flowchart. All subjects undergo a 4-month induction phase that includes IV gemcitabine + Abraxane and radiation therapy. If the subjects are stable with LAPC post-induction, they are randomized 1:1 into control group (IV gemcitabine + Abraxane) versus treatment group (intra-arterial gemcitabine via RenovoTAMP therapy). Subjects are then administered continuation therapy until disease progression and followed through survival.
 
In December 2021 we amended the protocol for this clinical trial to only allow for SBRT during the induction phase of the study (prior to randomization). We had previously permitted both SBRT and IMRT. Patients receiving IMRT must complete 25 radiation treatments in combination with oral chemotherapy during the induction phase of the study, which takes between 35 and 56 days to complete. In comparison, patients receiving SBRT during the induction phase are only required to complete 5 treatments, over 5 consecutive days, and do not receive oral chemotherapy. The decision to modify the study population was based on the observation in the Phase III TIGeR-PaC study that IMRT patients had a higher dropout rate during the induction phase of the study due to the high frequency of hospital visits and side effects from the required concurrent chemotherapy. As part of the pre-randomization, induction phase change made to the protocol, we initiated a review of the statistical considerations for the study and in June 2022, submitted the Modified SAP to FDA. As part of the Modified SAP, we now plan to (i) analyze only patients receiving SBRT, consistent with the protocol change made in December 2021, (ii) include a second interim analysis, (iii) change the total number of SBRT patients randomized in the study to 114 (a reduction from the original 200 patients) with a total of 86 deaths from SBRT patients, including all deaths from SBRT patients enrolled in the study before the submission of the Modified SAP, and (iv) repower the study from 90% to 80%, which is commonly used in clinical trials. We believe these changes will shorten the timeframe needed to complete the study and also significantly decrease our costs. We have not discussed the protocol amendment or the Modified SAP with the FDA, and we cannot provide any assurance that the FDA will agree with these modifications. As of March 8, 2023, we announced interim analysis results of the study suggesting a 6-month potential improvement in median overall survival with RenovoGem, pending ongoing clinical investigation. We believe this first-of-two interim analyses indicates that the TIGeR-PaC study is on track to demonstrate increased lifespan for patients being treated with RenovoGem for LAPC. Final analysis will be conducted after 86 protocol-specified events have occurred in the SBRT population with two planned interim analyses: this first analysis with 30% of the specified events (deaths) reported and the second analysis when 60% of the events have been reported (expected in 2024), with the final study readout in 2025.

In this interim analysis, the control and treatment arms demonstrated divergence in median overall survival for patients. The study is designed to randomize 114 patients (57 in each arm) with all patients receiving upfront induction chemotherapy and SBRT. The TIGeR-PaC DMC met and determined the interim data is promising and warrants continuation of this pivotal trial. As of the date of the analysis, 45 patients from U.S. sites had been randomized in this trial and the survival status of all subjects was used for the analysis.
 

● | 23 patients were randomized to intra-arterial gemcitabine (RenovoGem investigational treatment) arm and 22 to continuation of IV gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (control or standard of care) arm. There were an equal number of primary events, 13 in each arm. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The median overall survival in the IV gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel control arm was 10 months, versus 16 months in the intra-arterial RenovoGem arm. (NOTE: Both arms’ median overall survival calculations do not include 4 to 5-months of life since diagnosis during the induction chemotherapy and radiation phase of the trial). 
● | Observed a positive trend in median overall survival by 24-weeks (6-months); in this interim analysis, the statistical significance was not reached to stop the study early (p=0.051) 

 
Clinical Pharmacokinetic (PK) Data in Patients with LAPC Treated with Gemcitabine via RenovoTAMP
 
We expect intra-arterial gemcitabine delivered via the RenovoTAMP technique to have a pharmacokinetic profile that is distinct from intravenous gemcitabine dosing. Furthermore, with local delivery of gemcitabine into the tissue via RenovoTAMP and drainage into the liver prior to systemic circulation, we anticipate lower systemic levels of gemcitabine.
 
We presented the initial results of this substudy at ASCO-GI 2023 in San Francisco, CA. At the time of the analysis, 13 samples were collected across 5 TIGeR-PaC clinical sites. We demonstrated that the cohort had an average greater than 50% reduction in systemic drug exposure with IA delivery of gemcitabine using RenovoTAMP when compared with IV administration.

Second Solid Tumor Indication
 
eCCA Overview
 
Cholangiocarcinoma is the second most common primary malignant tumor of the liver with over 7,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the US. Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) develops after malignant transformation of the biliary tract mucosa. The global market of CCA was estimated to be $385 million in 2018 and the US accounted for the largest market size of CCA. Furthermore, the market size for global CCA therapeutics is estimated to grow by $83 million during 2019-2023 with a compound annual growth rate of 6%. Advanced age, male gender, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, and cirrhosis are some predisposing factors for development of CCA.
 
Based on the tumor location CCA is defined as intra-hepatic, or within the liver, or extrahepatic, or outside the liver. The eCCA subset of CCA patients is about 3,000 cases per year. eCCA is a disease with an exceptionally poor prognosis.
 
eCCA Current Treatment Landscape and Limitations
 
Most patients with eCCA have localized disease with possible extension of the tumor around the bile duct. Based on local extension of the disease, treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Surgical resection offers the only chance for curative therapy for patients with eCCA; however, the surgery is associated with high mortality and morbidity and most patients are not candidates. Systemic chemotherapy is a primary mode of treatment in these patients as a form of palliation, which is associated with morbidity and limited improvement in survival.
 
Current standard chemotherapy treatment in these patients is based on the ABC-2 Trial: a randomized trial of 410 patients with unresectable CCA (the study included intrahepatic, within the liver, and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients). Patients were treated with gemcitabine plus cisplatin, consisting of a three-week cycle, with treatments on Days 1 and 8 and dosing of gemcitabine at 1000 mg/m2 and cisplatin at 25 mg/m2. Reported median overall survival for patients on such a regimen (11.7 months) was greater than for patients receiving gemcitabine alone (8.1 months). With this standard of care treatment, commonly observed Grade 3-4 toxicities include anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, lethargy, nausea/vomiting, and anorexia. In the ABC-02 trial the efficacy of gemcitabine/cisplatin combination was not significantly different from that of gemcitabine alone in patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. For this reason, a standard of care practice has not been established for extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
 
More recently, the Phase III TOPAZ-1 study was presented at the 2022 ASCO GI in San Francisco, CA and demonstrated that the addition of durvalumab to the previously described gemcitabine/cisplatin regimen increased median overall survival from 11.6 months to 12.8 months in this patient population and subsequently received FDA approval.
 
RenovoGem for the Treatment of eCCA
 
Similar to RenovoGem for LAPC, we believe that RenovoGem may overcome the current treatment limitations of eCCA. In this setting, patients with eCCA have several tumor characteristics that create the potential for RenovoGem to be more effective than systemic chemotherapy. These characteristics include:
 

● | Local disease with possible extension of disease to local vasculature; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Avascular nature of the tumor lends itself to our RenovoTAMP approach, overcoming the limitations in drug delivery by targeting the periductal proper hepatic artery or left or right hepatic artery; 
● | Gemcitabine, used as a target molecule for this tumor type, has already been demonstrated to be safe in terms of local toxicity targeted via our approach to this vasculature and organ; and 
● | The bile duct around the hilum is usually within 1-14 mm (mean of 3.8 mm) of the hepatic artery: a reasonable target for RenovoTAMP therapy given the potential 4 cm tissue penetration of drug. 

 
Clinical Development of RenovoGem in eCCA
 
Rationale
 
In May 2020, the FDA granted us Orphan Drug Designation in May 2020 for RenovoGem for the treatment of CCA. We are planning to evaluate RenovoGem in a second indication in a Phase II/III trial in extrahepatic (or outside the liver) cholangiocarcinoma (or eCCA), cancer that occurs in the bile ducts that lead out of the liver and join with the gallbladder. After significant input from key opinion leaders across the spectrum of relevant medical specialties and feedback from the FDA, we submitted the protocol for a Phase II/III eCCA clinical trial to FDA, and after receiving feedback, we are finalizing the protocol and also including incorporating a recently approved drug, durvalumab into the study protocol with guidance from the Steering Committee. We anticipate launching this study mid this year. We have also secured FDA Orphan Drug Designation for RenovoGem for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma, which would provide us with seven years of orphan exclusivity to market RenovoGem for our eCCA indication upon NDA approval, provided that we are the first sponsor to obtain FDA approval for intra-arterial gemcitabine for the eCCA indication.
Market Opportunity
 
We are currently developing RenovoGem for LAPC. We also intend to develop it for eCCA, and potentially for locally advanced lung cancer, locally advanced uterine cancer and glioblastoma. We estimate that the total annualized addressable market opportunity for RenovoGem for our first market, LAPC, in the United States is approximately $0.5 billion and globally could exceed $1 billion based on a third-party market research analysis. The total cost of care for a patient on the standard of care treatment of gemcitabine + Abraxane is estimated at $67,216, which if applied to 60,000 pancreatic cancer cases per year would total $4 billion per year for the total US pancreatic cancer market.
 
Beyond our initially targeted subset of LAPC patients, we see potential to evaluate RenovoGem in additional settings where it may help to get more patients to surgery, prolong life, enhance systemic therapy or provide local therapy with fewer side effects than alternative treatments. These may include patients with stage 1 or stage 2 pancreatic cancer receiving neoadjuvant as well as in subpopulations of patients with metastases who also have locally advanced disease. Based on third-party market research, several physicians mentioned the role for local therapy as an adjunct for systemic chemotherapy as well as for patients who decline systemic chemotherapy. Among the locally advanced (stage 3) patients diagnosed with the cancers shown in Figure 22, we estimate that ~125,000 could be potentially addressable via RenovoGem.

● | All Pancreatic Cancers compared to Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancers (LAPC) 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | All Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) compared to Extrahepatic CCA 
● | All Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers (NSCLC) compared to Stage 3 NSCLC 
● | All Glioma compared to Glioblastoma 
● | All Uterine cancers versus Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) eligible uterine cancers 

 
We believe RenovoTAMP is broadly applicable to locally advanced tumors: our platform may be used with multiple small molecule chemotherapeutic agents in multiple solid tumor indications.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents and trademarks, maintain trade secret and know-how protection, enforce our proprietary rights against infringers, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. Because of the length of time and expense associated with developing new products and bringing them through the regulatory approval process, the health care industry places considerable emphasis on obtaining patent protection and maintaining trade secret protection for new technologies, products, processes, know-how, and methods.
 
Our intellectual property protection stems from several issued device and method patents on our RenovoCath delivery system that optimizes delivery of the anti-cancer drug and the RenovoTAMP therapy platform. Our issued patents also provide exclusivity as it relates to utilizing RenovoCath with anti-cancer drugs.
 
We have 8 US patents issued, 1 European patent issued, and 8 additional patents pending in the US, EU, and Asia. We continue to explore additional opportunities to further bolster our IP position. Table 3 below describes our issued patents, all of which have been assigned to us.

Orphan drug designation provides seven years post-approval market exclusivity protection. Gemcitabine is generic; however, we have exclusivity for the intra-arterial route of administration. RenovoGem is regulated by the FDA as a new oncology drug product. We intend to make intra-arterial gemcitabine and RenovoCath available as a combined product and not to make either component available separately. Once approved, we will have exclusivity over the use of intra-arterial gemcitabine as it will be approved by the FDA in combination with RenovoCath.
 
When appropriate, we actively pursue protection of our proprietary products, technologies, processes, and methods by filing United States and international patent and trademark applications. We seek to pursue additional patent protection for technology invented through research and development, manufacturing, and clinical use of our technology that will enable us to expand our patent portfolio around advances to our current systems, technology, and methods for our current applications as well as others.
 
There can be no assurance that the pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or provide us with a competitive advantage.
 
To maintain our proprietary position, we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary technological experience to protect proprietary manufacturing processes, technology, and know-how relating to our business. We rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with our marketing partners, employees, advisors, vendors and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. In addition, we also seek to maintain our trade secrets through maintenance of the physical security of the premises where our trade secrets are located. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge.
 
In certain circumstances, United States patent law allows for the extension of a patent’s duration for a period of up to five years after FDA approval. We intend to seek extension for one of our patents after FDA approval if it has not expired prior to the date of approval. In addition to our proprietary protections, the FDA has granted us two orphan drug designations that provide us a seven-year period of exclusive marketing beginning on the date that our NDA is approved by the FDA for the designated orphan drug. While the exclusivity only applies to the indication for which the drug has been approved, we believe that this exclusivity will provide us with added protection once commercialization of an orphan drug designated product begins.

There has been and continues to be substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and medical device areas. If a third party asserts a claim against us, we may be forced to expend significant time and money defending such actions and an adverse determination in any patent litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to redesign our product, require us to seek licenses from third parties, and, if licenses are not available, prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using our system. Additionally, we plan to enforce our intellectual property rights vigorously and may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights or to protect our trade secrets or know-how. Patent litigation can be costly and time consuming and there can be no assurance that the outcome will be favorable to us.
 
Manufacturing and Supply
 
For the catheter component (RenovoCath) of the drug/device combination, we currently rely on a single-source contract manufacturer, Medical Murray, North Barrington, IL. However, we are in early discussions with an additional manufacturer. We are subject to regulatory requirements of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (QSR), for medical devices sold in the United States, and the European Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC, which was replaced by the EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR) in May 2021, following a four-year transition period for medical devices marketed in the European Union. We have an agreement in place with Medical Murray to produce the RenovoCath through October 2024 with automatic annual renewal until termination by either party with 12 months’ notice. While we believe Medical Murray has the capabilities to scale RenovoCath production to peak forecasted commercial volumes, manufacturing can be transferred to additional vendors if needed.
 
The FDA monitors compliance with QSR through periodic inspections of both our facility and the facility of our contact manufacturer. Our European Union Notified Body, British Standards Institute (BSI), monitors compliance with the MDR requirements through both annual scheduled audits and periodic unannounced audits of our facilities as well as our contract manufacturer’s facilities.
 
Our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturer to maintain acceptable quality requirements could result in the shutdown of our manufacturing operations or the recall of products which could be detrimental to our company. If our contract manufacturer fails to maintain acceptable quality requirements, we may have to qualify a new contract manufacturer and could experience a material adverse effect to manufacturing and manufacturing delays as a result.
 
We do not own or operate and do not intend to establish our own gemcitabine manufacturing facilities.
 
Within our TIGeR-PaC Phase III trial, hospitals are sourcing generic gemcitabine labeled for IV use from their respective pharmacies to use in conjunction with the RenovoCath for the RenovoTAMP procedures. In the commercial setting, we expect to rely on contract manufacturing organizations for gemcitabine production, relabeling and co-packaging with the RenovoCath. The formulation of gemcitabine used in the TIGeR-PaC Phase III trial and in the commercial setting will be identical, however, the labeling of gemcitabine will be intra-arterial gemcitabine to be used exclusively in conjunction with RenovoCath.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our products are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation by foreign regulatory agencies and the FDA. Foreign regulatory agencies, the FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions impose extensive requirements upon the clinical development, pre-market clearance and approval, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, advertising and promotion, pricing, storage and distribution of pharmaceutical and medical device products. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory agency or FDA requirements may result in Warning Letters, fines, civil or criminal penalties, suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of a product from the market.
United States Regulatory Environment
 
In the US, the FDA regulates drug and device products, including combination, under the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. RenovoGem is subject to regulation as a combination product, which means it is composed of both a drug component and device component. Each component of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component and if marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and reviewed by different centers within the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a center that will have primary jurisdiction over its pre-market review and regulation based on a determination of its primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. The center that regulates the portion of the product that has the primary mode of action becomes the lead evaluator. When evaluating an application, a lead center may consult other centers but still retain complete reviewing authority, or it may collaborate with another center, by which the center assigns review of a specific section of the application to another center, delegating its review authority for that section. Typically, an applicant submits a single marketing application to the center selected to be the lead evaluator, although separate applications for each constituent part may be submitted to the applicable centers. Combination products where the drug provides the primary mechanism of action are often referred to as “drug-led combination” products.
 
In a drug/device combination product, containing two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, where the primary mode of action is typically a drug mode of action with the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, as the lead Center, CDER would review the NDA in consultation with the Center for Devices and Radiological Health on device-specific issues. For co-packaged or single-entity combination products there are two ways to comply with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements. Manufacturers can either (i) demonstrate compliance with all cGMP regulations applicable to each of the constituent parts in the combination product or (ii) in the case of drug/device combination products, demonstrate compliance with either the drug cGMP regulations or the device Quality System Regulation, or QSR, and also demonstrate compliance with additional provisions from the other of these two sets of cGMP requirements, as specified in the combination products regulations. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning or untitled letters, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of current or future products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, refusal or denial of submissions for new products, or withdrawal of clearance, authorization, or approval.
 
In the case of RenovoGem, the primary mode of action is attributable to the drug component of the product, which means that the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, has primary jurisdiction over its pre-market development and review. The underlying RenovoCath drug delivery device system used in RenovoGem has been separately cleared by the FDA as a Class II medical device (without any prepackaged drug product) for the isolation of blood flow and delivery of fluids, including diagnostic and/or therapeutic agents, to selected sites in the peripheral vascular system. The RenovoCath is also indicated for temporary vessel occlusion in applications including arteriography, preoperative occlusion, and chemotherapeutic drug infusion. The RenovoCath is intended for general intravascular use in the peripheral vasculature in arteries 3mm and larger. The RenovoCath is intended for use in arteries from 3mm in diameter for vessel entry and to occlude vessels ranging between 3mm to 11mm in diameter.
 
The process required by the FDA before drug product candidates, including drug-led combination products, may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated periodically, but at least annually; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


28
--


● | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication; 
● | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 
● | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is produced and tested to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and 
● | FDA review and approval of an NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. 

 
The development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
The results of preclinical tests (which include laboratory evaluation as well as GLP studies to evaluate toxicity in animals) for a particular product candidate, together with related manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. IND submissions may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information. Similar requirements to the United States, IND are required in the EU and other jurisdictions in which we may conduct clinical trials.
 
Clinical Trials
 
For purposes of NDA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap:
 

● | Phase I Clinical Trials. Studies are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, typically in healthy humans, but in some cases in patients. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase II Clinical Trials. Studies are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, explore the initial efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose range or pharmacodynamics. Multiple Phase II clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase III clinical trials. 
● | Phase III Clinical Trials. These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase II evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase III clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial centers. 
● | Phase IV Clinical Trials. The FDA may approve an NDA for a product candidate, but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug after NDA approval under a post-approval commitment. In addition, a sponsor may decide to conduct additional clinical trials after the FDA has approved an NDA. Post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase IV clinical trials. 

 
Sponsors of clinical trials may submit proposals for the design, execution, and analysis for their pivotal trials under a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. A SPA is an evaluation by the FDA of a protocol with the goal of reaching an agreement that the Phase III trial protocol design, clinical endpoints, and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the drug product candidate with respect to effectiveness for the indication studied. Under a SPA, the FDA agrees to not later alter its position with respect to adequacy of the design, execution or analyses of the clinical trial intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim in an NDA, without the sponsor’s agreement, unless the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug after testing begins.
 
Since the COVID-19 public health emergency, FDA has issued various COVID-19 guidance documents, including guidance on conducting clinical trials during the pandemic; resuming normal drug and biologics manufacturing operations; manufacturing, supply chain, and inspections; and statistical considerations for clinical trials during the COVID-19 public health emergency, among others. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations and clinical development plans is highly uncertain and subject to change and will depend on future developments, including new regulatory requirements and changes to existing regulations. If new guidance and policies are promulgated by the FDA that require changes in our clinical protocol or clinical development plans, our anticipated timelines and regulatory approval may be delayed or materially impacted. President Biden announced that the administration intends to end the COVID-19 national and public health emergencies on May 11, 2023. The full impact of the termination of the public health emergencies on FDA and other regulatory policies and operations are unclear.


New Drug Applications (NDAs)
 
The results of drug development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs also must contain extensive chemistry, manufacturing and control information. An NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee, which may be waived in certain circumstances. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review applications within ten months of submission or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months from submission. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. For new oncology products, the FDA will often solicit an opinion from an Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee, or ODAC, a panel of expert authorities knowledgeable in the fields of general oncology, pediatric oncology, hematologic oncology, immunologic oncology, biostatistics, and other related professions. The ODAC panel reviews and evaluates data concerning the safety and effectiveness of marketed and investigational human drug products for use in the treatment of cancer, and makes appropriate recommendations to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee.

Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will generally inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMPs is satisfactory, and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied. After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter, or CRL. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. A CRL may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase III clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data. Approval may be contingent on a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, that limits the labeling, distribution or promotion of a drug product. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety effects of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs or other information.
 
There are three primary regulatory pathways for an NDA under Section 505 of the FDCA: Section 505 (b)(1), Section 505 (b)(2) and Section 505(j). A Section 505 (b)(1) application is used for approval of a new drug (for clinical use) whose active ingredients have not been previously approved. A Section 505 (b)(2) application is used for a new drug that relies on data not developed by the applicant. Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. This statutory provision permits the approval of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits the applicant to rely in part upon the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for previously approved products. Section 505(j) application, also known as an abbreviated NDA, is used for a generic version of a drug that has already been approved.
 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a REMS to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 
The NDA review process for drug-led combination includes a review of the device constituent. In this case, the device constituent for RenovoGem is RenovoCath, which is cleared by the FDA.
 
Orphan Drug Exclusivity
 
Some jurisdictions, including the United States, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Pursuant to the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA grants orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. The orphan designation is granted for a combination of a drug entity and an indication and therefore it can be granted for an existing drug with a new (orphan) indication. Applications are made to the Office of Orphan Products Development at the FDA and a decision or request for more information is rendered in 60 days. NDAs for designated orphan drugs are exempt from user fees, obtain additional clinical protocol assistance, are eligible for tax credits up to 50% of research and development costs, and are granted a seven-year period of exclusivity upon approval. The FDA cannot approve the same drug for the same condition during this period of exclusivity, except in certain circumstances where a new product demonstrates superiority to the original treatment. Exclusivity begins on the date that the marketing application is approved by the FDA for the designated orphan drug, and an orphan designation does not limit the use of that drug in other applications outside the approved designation in either a commercial or investigational setting.
 
We have received orphan drug designations for RenovoGem for pancreatic cancer and cholangiocarcinoma.
 
The granting of orphan drug designations does not mean that the FDA has approved a new drug. Companies must still pursue the rigorous development and approval process that requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product will be granted at all, or on a timely basis.
 
Further, in Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra, 14 F.4th 1299 (11th Cir. 2021), the court disagreed with the FDA’s longstanding position that the orphan drug exclusivity only applies to the approved use or indication within an eligible disease. This decision created uncertainty in the application of the orphan drug exclusivity. On January 24, 2023, the FDA published a notice in the Federal Register to clarify that while the agency complies with the court’s order in Catalyst, the FDA intends to continue to apply its longstanding interpretation of the regulations to matters outside of the scope of the Catalyst order – that is, the agency will continue tying the scope of orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which a drug is approved, which permits other sponsors to obtain approval of a drug for new uses or indications within the same orphan designated disease or condition that have not yet been approved. It is unclear how future litigation, legislation, agency decisions, and administrative actions will impact the scope of the orphan drug exclusivity.


FDA Medical Device Regulation
 
Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified drug delivery medical device that we develop based on the current 510(k)-cleared RenovoCath and which we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, unless addressed as part of a new drug application for a drug/device combination product. New medical devices without an applicable predicate device as well as higher-risk medical devices are subject to premarket approval by the FDA under a PMA or a de novo classification from the FDA. The 510(k) clearance, PMA approval, and de novo classification processes can be resource intensive, expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available.
 
Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes – Class I, Class II or Class III – depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness.
 
Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of FDA regulations, referred to as the general controls for medical devices, which require compliance with the applicable portions of cGMP regulations known as the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful, and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices, also called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.

Class II devices are those that are subject to the general controls and special controls, as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, patient registries, FDA guidance documents, and post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process.
 
Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use or use advanced technology that are not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed predicate device. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the general controls and special controls described above. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (IDE), regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. If the device under evaluation does not present a significant risk to human health, then the device sponsor is not required to submit an IDE application to the FDA before initiating human clinical trials, but must still comply with abbreviated IDE requirements when conducting such trials. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA process, which is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process.
 
The 510(k) Clearance Process
 
Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent,” as defined in the statute, to a legally marketed predicate device. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was previously found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months, but may take longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees and for medical device establishments.
 
If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, the device is automatically classified into Class III. The device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek risk-based reclassification of the device through the de novo process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. A manufacturer can also submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance or de novo classification, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA or de novo classification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications are accomplished by a letter-to-file in which the manufacture documents the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for such change. The FDA can always review these letters to file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until marketing authorization is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
 
Other FDA Regulatory Requirements
 
Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping, annual product quality review and reporting requirements. Adverse event experiences with the product, including both drug-related and device-related adverse events (including device malfunctions and medical device reporting), must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA. Drug and device manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP and QSR, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form 483, Untitled Letters or Warning Letters that could cause us or our third-party manufacturers to modify certain activities. A Form 483 Notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection, list conditions the FDA investigators believe may have violated cGMP, QSR or other FDA regulations or guidelines. In addition to Form 483 Notices and Untitled Letters or Warning Letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations, QSR and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may require us to recall our products from distribution or withdraw any potential approvals of an NDA for that product.
 
The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs and devices may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or device, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA or clearance or approval of the modified device, respectively, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, Warning Letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties.
 
Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties, in particular in oncology. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use.

In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 
Foreign Regulatory Environment
 
If we seek to market RenovoGem in foreign jurisdictions, we could become subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding development, approval, commercial sales, and distribution of our products in addition to regulations in the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods. The review process may take longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, and/or criminal prosecution.
Other United States Healthcare Laws
 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical and medical device products, including drug/device combination products, pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business and may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing authorization. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations related to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. If manufacturers’ operations, including activities engaged by their contractors or agents, are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Affordable Care Act, or ACA, amended the intent element of the federal statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.
 
Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, the ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal False Claims Act. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 
Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the additional federal criminal statutes created by the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 
In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the storage, use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, and often are not preempted by HIPAA.
 
Further, pursuant to the ACA, the CMS has issued a final rule that requires applicable manufacturers of covered products, including prescription drugs and certain medical devices, to collect and annually report information on certain payments or transfers of value made in the previous year to physicians (defined to include doctors of medicine and osteopathy, dentists, podiatrists, optometrists and licensed chiropractors), certain non-physician healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, among others) and teaching hospitals, as well information regarding investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reported data is made available in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities and/or require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases, or prohibit prescription drug price gouging. In addition, certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement a healthcare compliance program or code of conduct. Certain states and local jurisdictions also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Compliance with these federal and state laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws are exposed to liabilities and civil penalties.

Efforts to ensure that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. If a drug company’s operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, it may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other federal or state government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, imprisonment, and reputational harm. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action for an alleged or suspected violation can cause a drug company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business, even if such action is successfully defended.
 
Healthcare Reform
 
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each as amended, collectively known as the ACA, was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contained a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and changes to fraud and abuse laws. Additionally, the ACA:

● | increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; 
● | required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 70 percent point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and 
● | imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs. 

 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, in June 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to challenge the ACA, dismissing the case on procedural grounds without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and healthcare measures promulgated by the Biden administration will impact the ACA, our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional action is taken by Congress. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments can vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester.
 
Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs will be eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than it receives on the sale of products, which could have a material impact on our business. In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes prescription drug provisions that have significant implications for the pharmaceutical industry and Medicare beneficiaries, including allowing the federal government to negotiate a maximum fair price for certain high-priced single source Medicare drugs, imposing penalties and excise tax for manufacturers that fail to comply with the drug price negotiation requirements, requiring inflation rebates for all Medicare Part B and Part D drugs, with limited exceptions, if their drug prices increase faster than inflation, and redesigning Medicare Part D to reduce out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for beneficiaries, among other changes. The impact of these regulations and any future healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by the Biden administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is currently unknown.
 
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, a number of states are considering or have recently enacted state drug price transparency and reporting laws that could substantially increase our compliance burdens and expose us to greater liability under such state laws once we begin commercialization after obtaining regulatory approval for any of our products.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the U.S. will depend, in part, on the availability of sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by third-party payors.
 
The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Additionally, in the U.S. there is no uniform policy among payors for coverage or reimbursement. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only at limited levels, successful commercialization of, and obtaining a satisfactory financial return on, any product we develop may not be possible.

Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for marketing, we may need to conduct expensive studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, which would be in addition to the costs expended to obtain regulatory approvals. Third-party payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development.
 
We are developing a new drug product, RenovoGem, which is intra-arterial gemcitabine delivered via the proprietary RenovoCath delivery system. If the drug is approved, it is expected to be sold together with the catheter used to administer the drug in the National Drug Code (NDC) created when the drug receives FDA approval. The reimbursement pathway involves separate payments for the drug product and for the occlusion procedure to administer it. As to the latter, it is anticipated that the procedure is accurately described by an existing code with existing payment levels. Given the expectation that the drug will be a novel, non-generic drug, a unique code and payment based on pricing information for the product should be established.
 
For the reasons discussed above, we believe there is a clear path to reimbursement for RenovoGem and its related procedure in both the hospital outpatient and physician office settings (which may include freestanding entities such as catheterization laboratories). As is typical for a product still in clinical development, it is difficult to predict whether there would be any Medicare coverage obstacles, which there usually are not for FDA approved drugs being used for on-label use. We believe the most important step we can take to enhance reimbursement for our products is the development of published, peer-reviewed clinical literature supporting their clinical benefit.
 
Competition
 
The oncology biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies and strong competition. While we believe that our knowledge, leadership, experience, scientific resources, intellectual property, regulatory barriers, and the advanced stage of our clinical development provide us with competitive advantages, we may face competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies, worldwide. Many potential competitors have substantially greater scientific, research, financial, technical, and/or human resources than we do.
 
Many companies are active in the oncology market both in terms of commercially marketed products and products in development that could potentially compete with our products and product candidates for the treatment of solid tumors. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete directly with approved and/or new therapies that may be approved in the future. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our product candidates which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position prior to us entering the market. Key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their safety, efficacy, convenience, price, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. Many companies are developing new therapeutics and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidate progresses through clinical development.
 
Currently, there are a number of companies in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of LAPC including Angiodynamics, Bausch Health, Fibrogen, NovoCure, and SynCore Biotechnology. We are aware of a number of companies in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of LAPC including one interventional company, TriSalus Lifesciences.
 
Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, marketing and personnel resources. In addition, some of our competitors have considerable experience in conducting clinical trials, regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities. Our competitors may develop alternative treatment methods, or achieve earlier product development, in which case the likelihood of us achieving meaningful revenues or profitability will be substantially reduced.
 
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, we had nine employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We focus on employee engagement and believe our relationship with our employees is good. We have 14 key consultants in the areas of quality, regulatory, finance, legal, clinical, and marketing.
 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, and incentivizing our existing employees. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
 
Facilities
 
Our administrative headquarters is located at 4546 El Camino Real, Suite B1, Los Altos, CA 94022. The office space is approximately 1,480 square feet, and we rent on a month-to-month basis. We believe that our facility is adequate for our current operations and purposes, and that suitable additional or alternative space will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms, if required.
Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we are engaged in various legal actions, claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which are expected to be material.
