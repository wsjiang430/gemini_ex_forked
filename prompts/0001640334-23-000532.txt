The Company’s Business

Overview

BioAdaptives’ core business is to investigate, market and distribute natural plant- and algal-based products and medical devices that improve health and wellness for humans and animals, with an emphasis on pain relief, anti-viral function, and anti-aging properties.

Effective November 15, 2021, the Company entered into a marketing agreement for an FDA-cleared Class II medical device, the Lung Flute™.  The Company is also exploring agreements with other medical device manufacturers; the owners of intellectual property relating to medical devices and processes; and marketing companies associated with these manufacturers and owners.

The Company’s current products include dietary supplements using natural ingredients and proprietary methods of optimizing the availability of nutrients in foods and beverages. The human products are designed to aid memory, cognition and focus; assist in sleep and fatigue reduction; provide pain relief and healing; and improve overall emotional and physical wellness.  The science behind our human products has proven to be effective for performance enhancement and pain relief for horses and dogs as well as providing improvements in appearance.  

Our current product line for humans includes PluriPain®, PrimiLungs™,SleepEZ™, MindNMemory™, Cell Rejuven™ and ProteinNMore™ .  We also market the Lung Flute™ and PrimiLungs™ product in our Lung Armor™ packaging, emphasizing the anti-viral properties of the nutraceutical and general respiratory health benefits from use of the device. Pluripain® is a fast acting long lasting all natural pain relief formulation. MindnMemory™ is a nootropic formulation that enhances memory, focus, mental clarity and endurance; PrimiSleep™ is a natural soporific that aids relaxation and sleep quality.  Cell Rejuven™ increases Energy and Mobility and resistance to stress, activates primitive cells, improves wound healing and promotes hair and nail growth. ProteinNMore™ aids in Rapidly building lean bulk muscle, promotes muscle contractility and strength as well as helps in improving blood flow. We acquired the licenses for these products during 2021 and 2022, and have commenced marketing activities for these products. 

Our animal products include Canine All-in-One™ and Equine All-in-One products for dogs and horses. These formulations evolved from Canine Regen® and Equine Regen® to trainers, horse owners and boarding stables.  Anecdotal and testimonial reports are that the equine products provide significant relief from exercise induced pulmonary hemorrhaging, as well as improved coat and mane appearance and hoof health.  

Effective February 2, 2022, the Company acquired the exclusive option to purchase U.S. Patent No. 9,783,432B (the “Patent”), covering technology used in enhancing the capability of water to hold significantly larger amounts of oxygen. The Agreement also allows the Company a two-year license to use the technology covered by the Patent, including for further development of oxygenated water products for consumers.  The Agreement was more fully discussed in the Company’s Form 8-K filed on February 6, 2022. As a result The Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, MORO2, Inc. to study the feasibility of this technology.

While we continue to investigate and acquire nutraceutical products for humans and animals, all of our current activities are reliant on marketing and distributing products developed and owned by others. We do not own the formulations for our key products and manufacture and market them under an agreement with the developer that requires payment of a royalty and license agreement

We are reliant on direct and indirect sales of the line of human products and the All-in-One animal products for revenues, along with Lung Armor™, none of which has produced any significant revenue yet.  We have very limited experience in marketing and have yet to develop reliable sales expectations and forecasting.

Market and Marketing

We market our science-based, quality nutraceuticals to a broad base of the population in the U.S., and are exploring marketing prospects in Asia, Australasia, the Middle East, and Europe. The Company’s current target markets also include equine and canine companion animals and equine competitors in the U.S., Australasia and the Middle East.

During 2022, we undertook direct mailing, use of social media, trade advertising and existing connections to create awareness about our human and animal products’ benefits.  We are developing affiliate marketing opportunities and recognize that a broader campaign using direct mail, and traditional advertising along with social media and more contemporary marketing tools is necessary.

We are pursuing scientific surveys and other testing to demonstrate the usefulness of our products.  While we do not anticipate developing testing protocols suitable for FDA approvals, we expect anecdotal and testimonial reports that will be useful in our marketing efforts.  The Company is currently continuing participating in a survey involving the use of PluriPain® by patients suffering from Gadolinium Deposition Disease (“GDD”).  The survey, conducted by a research team resident at Stanford University, is on-going and the early results are promising, with 60% of a small subject population reporting significant relief.  We have undertaken preliminary steps toward developing a survey/research protocol for use of the Lung Flute™ by long-term tobacco smokers and persons regularly exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke. We expect to continue these explorations in 2Q, 2023.

Our products have not changed, except for refinements and improvements, and we will continue to emphasize the unique qualities, use and function of our nutraceuticals.  We intend to create market share in our target demographic by (i) emphasizing the benefits of our proprietary algal-based, all-natural, stimulant-free, non-GMO ingredients that combine with proven Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurvedic botanicals into science-based formulations, (ii) investigating additional products in response to market demand and testing, and (iii) utilizing our marketing operation to act as its sales and distribution arm to seek additional channels for sales coverage.  

As noted above, we entered into licensing agreements for the MindnMemory™ product during 2022.  While the product is all-natural botanical formulations, as our other nutraceutical products, they represent a departure from our existing product lines because they are targeted to specific markets:  MindnMemory is a nootropic, intended to improve memory, enhances focus, mental clarity. endurance and mental acuity; our initial marketing efforts are oriented toward e-gamers and seniors.  

The Lung Flute™, especially when used with PrimiLungs™, shows promise.  The device is an FDA-cleared Class II medical device that employs user-generated acoustic waves to loosen lung secretions for expulsion.  In short, the device helps users clear their lungs.  In conjunction with the anti-viral function of PrimiLungs™, the Lung Defense™ package presents great opportunities in view of current fears of an endemic viral environment. Samples of this device were shipped to Poland for consideration for hospital use.

In addition, we are investigating the use of a formulation of PluriPain® targeted toward the symptoms of pre-menstrual syndrome and menstrual pain.  Anecdotal and testimonial reports have long noted that users obtain relief from these symptoms with use of the PluriPain® product, and we have made adjustments and additions to the formulation to target these symptoms.  Early reports regarding “PluriPain-PMS” are promising, and we expect marketing efforts to emphasize the usefulness of the new products.

With regard to animal products, in 2020, the Company formed the Livestock Impact Division, which entered into a business relationship with Livestock Impact, Inc.  We also entered into a Marketing and Licensing Agreement with the owners of these products providing us with exclusive rights to market these products. The President of the Division is Bruce Colclasure, a National Cutting Horse Association champion who owns and operates the Flying C Bar Ranch, and is the breeder and trainer of over 80 NCHA champion cutting horses.  Mr. Colclasure uses and endorses our Equine All-in-One™, Equine All-in One™ Plus and Equine All-in-One™ Extreme products and provides valuable feedback and testimonials regarding its function.  In addition, a high-performance formulation of our All-in-One product has been and is used by quarter horse trainers at facilities in Oklahoma and New Mexico, with excellent results.  We expect to use these results in our marketing efforts in 2023 and to expand our outreach program.

In 2022 we continued a marketing affiliate outreach program, directly contacting the principals of horse clubs and associations, offering discounts, samples and other inducements, seeking to develop “product champion” and “maven” relationships.  We have contacted principals in organizations with thousands of members and many more thousands of horses.  We have distributed samples and marketing materials to over 40 principals and influencers in regional and breed-specific equine associations and received good feedback from these marketing initiatives. quarter. Our expectation is that the use of the samples by these principals will demonstrate improvements in appearance and performance and that they will, in turn, recommend the product to their members.  We delayed contracting for print and on-line ads with certain of these organizations, as well as traditional magazine and other print placements, pending further results of our sample program, which we expected to learn in 1Q and 2Q 2023.  We have, effective March 3, 2022, arranged for a print ad campaign, which in two publications during Summer 2022. We intend to follow this with a direct mailing campaign in 2023.

The Company believes that the population growth in the seasoned and geriatric demographic cohort presents a unique opportunity. The World Health Organization has stated that the 60 years and over population segment will more than double from 11% to over 22% between 2000 and 2050, with the absolute number of people aged 60 and over expected to increase to 2 billion within the same period. The Company also recognizes the rising buying power and interests of the Millennials in wellness products and their choice of communication medium being social media and internet. It intends to establish a major focus to capture the anticipated growth in this sector. We believe that our social media promotion program will eventually gain traction and generate revenues, and are actively seeking a workable, efficient formula to grow consumer engagement and product sales.

The Company believes that international sales represent a significant future growth opportunity as aging population growth outside North America exceeds 1 billion people. The Company plans to aggressively pursue international sales by adding salespeople to its marketing effort, including use of social media, developing a network in high-growth APAC regions, and continuing its efforts to register products and trademarks in attractive foreign markets.

Manufacturing

All of the Company’s nutraceutical products are considered dietary supplements or natural foods, and we carefully avoid making health, drug or disease cure claims that could trigger regulatory compliance issues and affect our ability to market BioAdaptives products. Our active ingredients are all plant- or algal-based and sourced worldwide from reputable suppliers who employ stringent compliance and sustainable agriculture practices or operate NSF-certified (or equivalent) facilities.  

BioAdaptives actively investigates new products, techniques and novel applications of existing products or technology in our research. The Company’s research work has centered on investigations of all-natural supplement formulations that activate primitive cells, including stem cells and their derivatives, and natural ingredients that encourage stem cell proliferation. In 2022, the Company started a line of products utilizing both Algae and mushrooms.

With regard to medical devices, we purchase the LungFlute™ from a company affiliated with the patent holder.  We do not expect to develop any direct capability to manufacture medical devices for numerous reasons, including a lack of capital and the fact that amortized cost of such facilities, if we were to construct or acquire them, is generally far higher compared to the cost of purchase of a finished product.  

As noted above, it is our intention to operate primarily as a marketing company, developing consumer markets for nutraceutical products and medical devices that we license or market for others.  

Employees

In 2022, The Company has 3 full-time non-executive employees and 4 part-time employees.  We retain hourly labor on an as-needed basis and professional consultants to operate our business.

The management of the Company expects to continue use of outside consultants, attorneys, and accountants, as necessary, so long as it is seeking and evaluating business opportunities.

The need for additional employees, and their availability, will be addressed in connection with the decision whether or not to acquire or participate in specific business opportunities.
