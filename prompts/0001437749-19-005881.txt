Item 1. Business.
 
Description of the Company's Business
 
Gyrodyne, LLC (including its subsidiaries, “Gyrodyne”, the “Company” or the “Registrant”) is a limited liability company formed under the laws of the State of New York whose primary business is the management of a portfolio of medical office and industrial properties and the pursuit of entitlement on such properties located in Suffolk and Westchester Counties, New York.
 
Substantially all of our developed properties are subject to leases in which the tenant reimburses the Company for a portion, all of or substantially all of the costs and/or cost increases for utilities, insurance, repairs, maintenance and real estate taxes. Certain leases provide that the Company is responsible for certain operating expenses.
 
Gyrodyne’s corporate strategy is to enhance the value of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor by pursuing entitlement opportunities and enhancing the value of its leases. The Board believes the aforementioned strategy will improve the chances of increasing the values for such properties. The value of the real estate reported in the consolidated statements of net assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 (predicated on current asset values) does not include the potential value impact that may result from such value enhancement efforts. There can be no assurance that our value enhancement efforts will result in property value increases that exceed the costs we incur in such efforts, or even any increase at all.
 
Our efforts to generate the highest values for Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor may involve in limited circumstances the pursuit of joint venture relationships, entitlements, other investments and/or other strategies to enhance the net value of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor to maximize the returns for our shareholders. The Company does not expect the pursuit of joint ventures, if any, to adversely affect the timing of distributions to our shareholders. Gyrodyne intends to dissolve after it completes the disposition of all of its real property assets, applies the proceeds of such dispositions first to settle any debts and claims, pending or otherwise, against Gyrodyne, and then makes liquidating distributions to holders of Gyrodyne common shares. The liquidation process and the amount and timing of distributions involve risks and uncertainties. As such, it is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate amount of proceeds that will actually be distributed to our shareholders or the timing of such payments. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the distributions will equal or exceed the estimate of net assets in liquidation presented in our Consolidated Statements of Net Assets. The actual nature, amount and timing of all distributions will be determined by Gyrodyne’s Board in its sole discretion and will depend in part upon the Company’s ability to convert our remaining assets into cash in compliance with our obligations under the Stipulation entered into in connection with the class action lawsuit (See Item 3 – Legal Proceedings) and settle and pay our remaining liabilities and obligations. Under Gyrodyne’s Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (the “LLC Agreement”), dissolution of the Company may be effected upon the vote of holders of a majority of Gyrodyne common shares or, in the Board’s discretion and without any separate approval by the holders of the Gyrodyne common shares, at any time the value of Gyrodyne’s assets, as determined by the Board in good faith, is less than $1,000,000.
 
We intend to stay focused on (1) enhancing the net value of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor to maximize the returns for our shareholders. (2) completing the disposition of our assets (3) making timely distributions to our shareholders, (4) managing capital and liquidity, (5) mitigating risks relating to interest rates and real estate cycles and (6) completing the liquidation of the Company.
 
After giving effect to the Company’s dispositions of real property through December 31, 2018, the Company owns the following properties:
 
● | the Cortlandt Manor Medical Center comprising approximately 34,000 square feet residing on approximately 13.8 acres; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 3




● | the Flowerfield Industrial Park comprising approximately 127,000 rentable square feet. The industrial park is multi-tenanted and situated on ten acres of a 68-acre property in St. James, New York, all of which is owned by the Company. Approximately 62 of the 68 acres is included in the subdivision application filed with the Town of Smithtown.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Each of the medical office park in Cortlandt Manor and the Flowerfield Industrial Park (including its undeveloped portion) is individually owned in a single asset limited liability company wholly-owned by the Company.
 
Properties Sold
 
Port Jefferson Professional Park. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company sold one building and three buildings, respectively, (approximately 4,000 square feet each) in the Port Jefferson Professional Park as follows:

Port Jefferson Professional Park Location | Closing Date | Gross Sales Proceeds
-------------------------------------------+-----------------+---------------------
 | | 2018 | 2017 
11 Medical Drive | August 31, 2018 | $800,000 | 
5380 Nesconset Highway and 9 Medical Drive | June 15, 2017 | | $2,000,000
1 Medical Drive | August 4, 2017 | | 800,000 
Total | | $ 800,000 | $2,800,000

 
Following the sales indicated above, the Company no longer owns any buildings in the Port Jefferson Professional Park.
 
Strategic Plan to Enhance Property Values, Liquidate and Dissolve
 
Our corporate strategy is to pursue entitlement opportunities intended to increase the values of our two remaining properties so that they can be sold to one or more developers at higher prices (than those achievable under their current entitlements) that will maximize distributions to our shareholders during the liquidation process. Gyrodyne intends to dissolve after it completes the disposition of all of its real property assets, applies the proceeds of such dispositions first to settle any debts and claims, pending or otherwise, against Gyrodyne, and then makes liquidating distributions to holders of Gyrodyne common shares. We are unable to predict the precise nature, amount or timing of such distributions. To accomplish this, the Company’s plan consists of:

● | managing the real estate portfolio to improve operating cash flow while simultaneously increasing the market values of the underlying properties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | managing the strategic sale of real estate assets;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | pursuing the entitlement efforts of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties, to maximize value;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | focusing use of capital by the Company to preserve or improve the market value of the real estate portfolio; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | balancing working capital and funds available for the entitlement process.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Gyrodyne’s dual strategy is to enhance the value of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor by pursuing entitlement opportunities while simultaneously enhancing the value of its leases. The Board believes the aforementioned dual strategy will improve the chances of increasing the values for such properties. The value of the real estate reported in the statements of net assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 (predicated on current asset values) does not include the potential value impact that may result from such value enhancement efforts. There can be no assurance that our value enhancement efforts will result in property value increases that exceed the costs we incur in such efforts, or even any increase at all. Our efforts to generate the highest values for Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor may involve, in limited circumstances, the pursuit of joint venture relationships, entitlements and other investments and/or other strategies to maximize the returns for our shareholders. The Company does not expect the pursuit of joint ventures, if any, to adversely affect the timing of the distributions to our shareholders.
 
The Company is making tenant improvements at Flowerfield to convert certain existing industrial space into office space pursuant to amended and new leases with Stony Brook University and institutions affiliated with it, respectively, which collectively comprise approximately 34,000 square feet of leases. In addition, the Company renewed and approximately doubled the footprint of a lease with an athletic facility to approximately 16,000 square feet. The planned tenant improvements for such respective leases signed in the year ended December 31, 2018 of approximately $1.80 million is associated with $6.4 million in rent commitments and will be financed with a non-revolving credit line (rather than cash on hand) secured by the Flowerfield industrial buildings and the specific tax lot they reside on. The Company has completed $1.4 million of the $1.8 million in tenant improvements. The balance, attributable to the new leases signed with an institution affiliated with Stony Brook University and an athletic facility in the third quarter of 2018, is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2019. The additional value from leases signed with Stony Brook University and institutions affiliated with it and the athletic facility during the year ended December 31, 2018 and the estimated cost of the related tenant improvements were included in the respective financial statements in the period such values or costs were probable and estimable.

Sales of properties by Gyrodyne could take the form of individual sales of assets, as has been our recent experience in Port Jefferson, sales of groups of assets, a single sale of all or substantially all of the assets or some other form of sale. The assets may be sold to one or more purchasers in one or more transactions over a period of time.
 
A sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company would require shareholder approval under New York law. However, in the event of the sale of individual properties, that do not constitute substantially all of the Company’s assets, it is not required or anticipated that any shareholder votes will be solicited. The prices at which the various assets may be sold depend largely on factors beyond our control, including, without limitation, the condition of financial and real estate markets, the availability of financing to prospective purchasers of the assets, regulatory approvals, public market perceptions, and limitations on transferability of certain assets.
 
We cannot give any assurance on the timing of the ultimate sale of all of the Company’s properties. Assuming the liquidation process continues through June 30, 2020 and giving effect to the estimated cash flows from the operation of our existing properties, we expect that Gyrodyne will have a cash balance of approximately $26.8 million, prior to any future special distributions based on the estimate of net assets in liquidation presented in our Consolidated Statements of Net Assets. Such cash would equate to future liquidating distributions of $18.11 per share based on Gyrodyne having 1,482,680 common shares outstanding. These estimated distributions are based on values at December 31, 2018 and do not include the potential value that may be derived from the entitlement efforts to maximize the value of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor. While the real estate market is dynamic and the economy is volatile, the Company believes that the increase in estimated distributions resulting from these enhancement efforts will exceed the remaining estimated $1.5 million investment in those efforts, although there can be no assurance of such excess or whether any appreciation at all will be realized.
 
The Statement of Net Assets is based on certain estimates.  Uncertainties as to the precise value of our non-cash assets, which exclude the estimated additional value achievable from the costs incurred to pursue the maximum value on Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor through the entitlement efforts (including the pursuit of special permits) and the ultimate amount of our liabilities make it impracticable to predict the aggregate net value ultimately distributable to shareholders in a liquidation. Land entitlement costs, claims, liabilities and expenses from operations, including operating costs, salaries, income taxes, payroll and local taxes, legal, accounting and consulting fees and miscellaneous office expenses, will continue to be incurred during our liquidation process, which includes certain enhancement efforts. Excluding the value that may be achieved from the entitlement efforts, expenses incurred in pursuing the Company’s business plan will reduce the amount of assets available for ultimate distribution to shareholders, and, while a precise estimate of those expenses cannot currently be made, management and our Board believe that available cash and amounts received on the sale of assets will be adequate to provide for our obligations, liabilities, expenses and claims (including contingent liabilities) and to make cash distributions to shareholders. However, no assurances can be given that available cash and amounts received on the sale of the remaining assets will be adequate to provide for our obligations, liabilities, expenses and claims and to make cash distributions to shareholders. If such available cash and amounts received on the sale of assets are not adequate to provide for our obligations, liabilities, expenses and claims, there will be no further distributions of cash and other assets to our shareholders.  The Company intends to maintain reasonably adequate reserves to satisfy known and foreseeable liabilities.  Nevertheless, in the event our shareholders receive distributions from Gyrodyne and such reserves are insufficient to pay any creditors who seek payment of claims against Gyrodyne, shareholders could be held liable for payments made to them and could be required to return all or a part of the distributions made to them.
 
Property Value Enhancement
 
The Company is pursuing entitlements to maximize the value of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred approximately $1,261,000 of land entitlement costs, mainly engineering costs to support the Company’s respective entitlement efforts. We estimate that the Company may incur approximately $1.5 million in additional land entitlement costs through June 30, 2020 in pursuit of entitlements (approximately $465,000 in Cortlandt Manor and $1 million in Flowerfield).
 
The Company is focusing its resources on positioning the properties to be sold with all entitlements necessary to achieve maximum pre-construction values in the shortest period of time with the least amount of risk to the Company. During the process of pursuing such entitlements, the Company may entertain offers from potential buyers who may be willing to pay prices for the properties that the Company finds more attractive from a timing or value perspective than values we believe may be reasonably achievable through completing the entitlement process ourselves. While the real estate market is dynamic, the economy is uncertain and there can be no assurances, we anticipate that these expenditures will result in higher sale prices of the properties and larger liquidating distributions to our shareholders than could otherwise be achievable.
 
Cortlandt Manor. On March 15, 2016, the Town of Cortlandt Manor (the “Town”) adopted a 2016 Sustainable Comprehensive Plan (the “Plan”) of which one key strategy was the simultaneous creation of a Medical Oriented District. The purpose of the proposed Medical Oriented District (“MOD”) is to expand the Town’s existing medical infrastructure and encourage economic development, including capital investment, job creation and housing options. The MOD would allow for a continuum of care, i.e., independent living, assisted living and nursing/hospital care, within or in neighboring facilities by centralizing medical services and related activities. As a designated zoning district, the MOD could include hospital, ambulatory surgery, primary and urgent care, hospice, laboratories, social services, boutique hotels, retail and a wide range of housing.

The Company’s existing 33,871 square foot Cortlandt Medical Center and its approximate 13.8 acres are located directly opposite New York Presbyterian’s Hudson Valley Hospital Center and within the boundaries of the MOD. The Company has committed resources toward both market research and feasibility studies in support of achieving entitlements to maximize the value of the property. For approximately three years the Company along with its planner and engineers have been working closely with the Town to identify issues and solutions involved in creating the Plan and more specifically, the MOD.
 
On April 20, 2017, the Company closed on the purchase of an approximate 0.3-acre property at a cost of $353,000, inclusive of closing costs.  The property is located adjacent to the Cortlandt Medical Center and is within the boundary of the MOD.  Although there can be no assurances, the property may provide additional vehicular access to the site from Buttonwood Drive and State Route 202 and additional parking which the Company believes will further increase the yield in a manner that is cost effective and provide a significant return on investment to the shareholders.
 
On March 31, 2017, The Company filed an application with the Town to develop the Cortlandt Manor property, as follows:
 

SUBDIVISION LOT # | BUILDING SIZE/YIELD
------------------------+--------------------
Medical office | 100,000 sft 
Multi-family apartments | 200 units 
Retail | 4,000 sft 

 
The Company has been working with Town officials on entitlement complexity, environmental impact studies, traffic mitigation, effluent mitigation, financial impact and other variables to conform our application with the Town’s vision on the MOD. 
 
The entitlement costs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 associated with the ownership and development of this property consisted of architectural and engineering costs, legal expenses, economic analysis, soil management, surveys and land acquisitions were $414,982 and $736,867, respectively. Total entitlement costs from the 2013 appraisal date were $1,717,265.
 
As a property owner with eligible parcels in this district, Gyrodyne submitted an Environmental Assessment Form to the Town of Cortlandt Planning Department in December 2017 to support its application to receive a MOD campus designation. Once designated, the parcels would be governed by the use, dimensional and other provisions of the MOD zoning regulations and MOD zoning would replace the existing zoning. While the MOD zoning has not been formally adopted, Gyrodyne is proposing medical office and residential use with limited retail and has designed the site to function as part of a future "hamlet center” with mixed use, streetscape improvements, a hamlet green and public plaza, and significant open space around Orchard Lake.
 
The Town of Cortlandt Planning Department hosted two public hearing community outreach meetings in June and August 2018 where the Company presented its development plan for the Cortlandt Manor property. As anticipated, on August 7, 2018, the Town Planning Board formally issued a “positive declaration” under the State Environmental Quality Review Act (“SEQRA”), i.e., a declaration that the project may result in one or more significant environmental impacts and will require the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”), the scope of which was also adopted. On August 28, 2018, the Town filed the Scope for a Draft Generic Environmental Impact Statement (“GEIS”) with input from Gyrodyne for both the MOD zoning and the proposed uses so that upon adoption, minimal further SEQRA review should be required to develop the property. The Company anticipates the Town will complete its SEQRA process in the fourth quarter of 2019. It is noted that the Town planning consultant has been performing the traffic/transportation study over the past nine months, including extensive coordination with NYSDOT, which will comprise a substantial portion of the GEIS. The Company does not plan on developing the property but rather positioning the properties to be sold with all entitlements necessary to achieve maximum pre-construction value for the Company in the shortest period of time with the least amount of risk to the Company.
 
Flowerfield. Following market research and related feasibility studies, we identified the entitlements that we believe will maximize the value of Flowerfield in the shortest amount of time with the lowest amount of risk. The Company has been in discussions with the Town of Smithtown on the potential real estate development projects identified by the market research and feasibility studies, all of which currently fall within our “as of right to build” zoning. We are also exploring with the Town of Smithtown whether it would be amenable to certain entitlements, special permits, or other concessions that would allow for the identified development projects.

In March 2017, the Company filed a pre-subdivision application with the Town of Smithtown (the “Pre-application”) for the Flowerfield property along with the previously sold (2002) catering hall facility for an eight-lot subdivision which the Town of Smithtown has determined must be processed as a nine-lot subdivision in response to certain comments received from the planning department. In June 2017, the Company filed a subdivision application with the Town of Smithtown based on feedback provided by the Town of Smithtown staff in the pre-application process. Because of the property’s location within 500 feet of a municipal boundary and a state road, the Town of Smithtown referred the Company’s subdivision application to the Suffolk County Planning Commission as required by the Suffolk County Administrative Code and the New York State General Municipal Law.
 
On August 2, 2017, the Suffolk County Planning Commission voted 11-0 to approve Gyrodyne’s subdivision application without conditions. Although the approval by the Suffolk County Planning Commission is not binding on the Town of Smithtown, the approval without conditions means that the requisite vote threshold for the application at the Town of Smithtown’s Planning Board is a simple majority.
 
On November 15, 2017, the Town of Smithtown Planning Board conducted a public hearing where the Company presented its subdivision plan of the Flowerfield property. On April 11, 2018, the Planning Board determined that the subdivision plan may result in one or more significant environmental impacts which will require the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement. As a result, at the April 11, 2018 Planning Board meeting, the Planning Board issued a SEQRA Positive Declaration, which was rescinded and re-issued by Planning Board Resolution dated May 9, 2018 to include a public scoping process. The then current Town Planning Board Chairman communicated that a Positive Declaration will require up to one year to complete the SEQRA process. The Town issued the Final Scope on July 7, 2018. On August 15, 2018, the Company submitted the EIS to the Town of Smithtown Planning Department prior to the public hearing. The Company received comments on its EIS at the end of the third quarter of 2018 and submitted its response to the Town of Smithtown Planning Department on February 15, 2019.
 
The entitlement costs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 associated with the ownership and development of this property consisted of architectural and engineering costs, legal expenses, economic analysis, soil management and surveys were $846,066 and $981,253, respectively. Total entitlement costs from the 2013 appraisal date were $2,769,807. The Company owns an additional 5.2 acres bordering the industrial park that are currently zoned residential and are not part of the subdivision application.
 
While we cannot predict the outcome of the subdivision application, we have undertaken to subdivide the Flowerfield property in a manner that we believe will result in maximum pre-construction values in the shortest amount of time and limited risk.
 
Flowerfield Industrial Park Value Enhancement Strategy. The Company’s strategy is to: a) pursue entitlements to maximize the pre-construction value of Flowerfield and b) enhance the value of the Flowerfield Industrial Park’s current buildings even further by expanding our relationship with our largest tenant, Stony Brook University and institutions affiliated with it.
 
The Company’s strategy to maximize the value of the Flowerfield Industrial Park includes repositioning the park’s industrial buildings to service Stony Brook University and institutions affiliated with it, inclusive of Stony Brook University Hospital, while also making it a cultural destination (arts, health and wellness center) for the community. The Company believes this strategy will enhance the value of the entitlements while also increasing the cashflow and market value of the industrial buildings.
 
Our business relationship with Stony Brook University and institutions affiliated with it is expanding. Effective October 24, 2017, the Company and the State of New York acting through Stony Brook University Hospital (“SBU Hospital”) entered into an amendment to the existing lease with SBU Hospital (approved by the New York State Controller’s Office on January 19, 2018) for the expansion of the existing space currently occupied by SBU Hospital from approximately 13,747 square feet at a rate of $24.76 per square foot to 26,573 square feet at rate of $19.00 (plus annual escalations) per square foot. The total lease commitment from the amendment net of the existing lease is approximately $3.5 million and extends through 2025. The lease amendment obligated the Company, at its sole cost and expense, to build out the additional 12,826 square feet (the “Additional Space”) and provide a "turnkey" facility in accordance with an agreed-upon work letter. The tenant took possession in the third quarter of 2018.
 
In addition, in September 2018, we entered into a new seven-year lease with an institution affiliated with SBU Hospital for approximately 4,800 square feet. The total lease commitment is approximately $600,000. The lease obligated the Company, at its sole cost and expense, to build out the 4,800 square feet and provide a "turnkey" facility in accordance with an agreed-upon work letter.
 
To finance the capital improvements, most of which relate to leasing activity, the Company secured a non-revolving credit line for up to $3,000,000 (the “Original Line”) with a bank, which closed on March 21, 2018.  There is an interest only phase for the first eight months of the loan (“Interest-Only Phase”) after which it automatically converts to a permanent loan maturing on November 30, 2025 (84 months after conversion to a permanent loan) (the “Permanent Phase”).  The interest rate during the Interest-Only Phase shall be a variable rate equal to the daily highest prime rate published by the Wall Street Journal plus 100 basis points (1% rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent).  During the Permanent Phase, the Company will pay interest at a fixed rate based on the Federal Home Loan Bank rate for a 7-year maturity as made available by the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York plus a margin of 200 basis points (2%) rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent but in no event less than 4.25%, plus principal based on a 20-year amortization period.  Permanent Phase interest rate currently would be 5.125%. 
 
 7



On January 24, 2019, the Company amended and extended the Original Line which included extending the maturity date of the interest only phase to the earlier of January 20, 2020 or upon drawing down a total of $3,000,000 after which it automatically converts to a permanent loan maturing the earlier of January 20, 2027 or 84 months after conversion to a permanent loan (the “Permanent Phase”). The interest rate during the Interest-Only Phase shall be a variable rate equal to the daily highest prime rate published by the Wall Street Journal plus 100 basis points (1% rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent), but in no event less than the initial interest rate in effect on the closing date (6.5%). During the Permanent Phase, the Company will pay interest at a fixed rate based on the Federal Home Loan Bank rate for a 7-year maturity as made available by the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York plus a margin of 200 basis points (2%) rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent, plus principal based on a 20-year amortization period. Permanent Phase interest rate currently would be 5.125%.
 
The tenant improvements pursuant to above leasing activity with SBU Hospital and institutions affiliated with it are expected to cost approximately $1.48 million and are associated with rent commitments of approximately $4.1 million.  The first advance of $1.1 million was used to finance the work required for the lease amendment. The balance of the loan can be drawn upon for improvements to be completed by the Company, as landlord, pursuant to the new lease above and future leases with Stony Brook University or institutions affiliated with it (or other tenants subject to the bank’s approval) anytime during the Interest-Only Phase. 
 
The Company intends to draw an additional $1.1 million in 2019 to fund additional tenant improvements related to leases signed through December 31, 2018.
 
The loan is secured by approximately 31.8 acres of the Flowerfield Industrial Park including he related buildings and leases. The Company is in compliance with the loan covenants. 
 
Health Care Industry

Our tenants in our Cortlandt Manor property are healthcare service providers. Furthermore, the Company is repositioning the industrial buildings, in the Flowerfield Industrial Park, to expand and support Stony Brook University and Stony Brook University Hospital. The healthcare industry is subject to substantial regulation and faces increased regulation particularly relating to fraud, waste and abuse, cost control and healthcare management. The healthcare industry may experience a significant expansion of applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations, previously enacted or future healthcare reform, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or changes in enforcement priorities, all of which could materially impact the business and operations of our tenants and therefore the marketability of our properties.
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “ACA”) impacted the healthcare marketplace by decreasing the number of uninsured individuals in the United States through the establishment of health insurance exchanges to facilitate the purchase of health insurance, expanded Medicaid eligibility, subsidized insurance premiums and included requirements and incentives for businesses to provide healthcare benefits. The ACA remains subject to continuing and increasing legislative and administrative scrutiny, including current efforts by Congress and the current presidential administration to repeal, alter and replace the ACA in total or in part. In 2017, Congress unsuccessfully sought to replace substantial parts of the ACA with different mechanisms for facilitating insurance coverage in the commercial and Medicaid markets, but was able to enact legislation eliminating the tax penalty for individuals who do not purchase insurance. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) discontinued providing cost-sharing reduction subsidies to insurance providers, which is expected to have the result of increasing the cost of insurance premiums. Further, CMS has begun approving waivers permitting states to alter state Medicaid programs by, among other things, requiring individuals to meet certain requirements, such as work requirements, in order to maintain eligibility for Medicaid. These and other actions may impact the insurance markets and reduce the number of individuals purchasing insurance or qualifying for Medicaid and may negatively impact the operations and financial condition of our medical office tenants, which in turn may adversely impact us. Congress may revisit ACA or Medicaid reform legislation in 2019. If the ACA is repealed or further substantially modified, or if implementation of certain aspects of the ACA are suspended, such actions could negatively impact the operations and financial condition of our medical office tenants, which in turn may adversely impact us.
 
Our tenants are subject to extensive federal, state, and local licensure laws, regulations and industry standards governing business operations, the physical plant and structure, patient rights and privacy and security of health information. Our tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of licensure, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines or other penalties, suspension or exclusion from the government sponsored Medicare and Medicaid programs, loss of accreditation or certification, or closure of the facility. In addition, efforts by third-party payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private insurance carriers, including health maintenance organizations and other health plans, impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls upon healthcare provider operations (through changes in reimbursement rates and methodologies, discounted fee structures, the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk or otherwise). Our tenants may also face significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees, all of which could impact their ability to pay rent or other obligations to us.

The Company is pursuing entitlements on the Cortlandt Manor and Flowerfield properties, the value of which may be adversely affected by the aforementioned factors.
 
Real Estate
 
The Company owns properties in St. James and Cortlandt Manor, New York.
 
St. James, New York.  In St. James, New York, the Company owns a 68-acre site called Flowerfield, primarily zoned for light industry, which is located approximately 50 miles east of New York City on the North Shore of Long Island in the Town of Smithtown. Flowerfield's location places it in Hydrogeologic Zone VIII, one of the most liberal with respect to effluent discharge rates. Gyrodyne currently has 127,573 square feet of rentable space located on approximately 10 acres of developed property at Flowerfield. As of December 31, 2018, there were 30 tenants, inclusive of 4 tenants under month-to-month commitments, comprising 36 leases. The annual base rent at Flowerfield based on the rates in effect as of December 2018 is approximately $1,251,000 which included month-to-month annualized base rent of approximately $17,000 on 2,028 square feet. The occupancy rate was 72% as of December 31, 2018. Upon completion of the respective tenant improvements associated with leases signed late in 2018, the occupancy rate will rise to 82% and reflect annualized revenue of approximately $1,374,000. 
 
As discussed under Property Value Enhancements, new additions to the Flowerfield campus would be focused on uses supportive and beneficial to SBU. Furthermore, the connection with SBU via the existing LIRR crossing, which we are actively negotiating the re-opening of, will help to foster synergies between Flowerfield and SBU.  Consistent with this strategy, the Company is repositioning the industrial buildings to expand and support Stony Brook University. The Company expanded its leasing relationship with SBU and its affiliates from 16,420 square feet to 34,440 square feet or approximately 27% of the Flowerfield Industrial buildings rentable square feet. Furthermore, the company is actively discussing with SBU how Flowerfield could further support their needs.
 
Cortlandt Manor, New York. In Cortlandt Manor, New York, the Company owns 13.8 acres inclusive of the 33,871 square foot Cortlandt Medical Center. The property is located directly opposite New York Presbyterian’s Hudson Valley Hospital Center and within the boundaries of the MOD. The property consists of six office buildings. As of December 31, 2018, there were 10 tenants, comprising 11 leases. The annual base rent based on the rates in effect as of December 2018, is approximately $887,000. The property was 96% occupied as of December 31, 2018. The Company is actively repositioning the Cortlandt Manor property toward short-term leases to allow for a more timely and efficient transition into a development property. During early 2019, the Company terminated a long-term lease for 3,943 square feet and annual revenue of $115,380. The Company is converting the leases for all of its Cortlandt Manor tenants upon lease expiration to short term leases to allow prospective buyers the maximum flexibility to begin development following receipt of site approvals.
 
On April 20, 2017, the Company closed on the purchase of an approximate 0.3 acres in Cortlandt Manor, New York.  The purchase price, inclusive of closing costs, was approximately $353,000. The property adjoins the Cortlandt Medical Center and is within the boundary of the MOD. Although no assurances can be made, the property may provide additional vehicular access to the site from Buttonwood Drive and State Route 202 and additional parking which the Company believes will further increase the yield in a manner that is cost effective and should provide a significant return on investment to the shareholders.
 
As discussed under Property Value Enhancements, each of the parcels are located within the boundaries of the MOD.  Gyrodyne submitted an Environmental Assessment Form to the Town of Cortlandt Planning Department in December 2017 to support its application to receive a MOD campus designation. Once designated, the parcels would be governed by the use, dimensional and other provisions of the MOD zoning regulations and MOD zoning would replace the existing zoning. While the MOD zoning has not been formally adopted, Gyrodyne is proposing medical office and residential use with limited retail and has designed the site to function as part of a future "hamlet center” with mixed use, streetscape improvements, a hamlet green and public plaza, and significant open space around Orchard Lake.

Tax Status
 
Gyrodyne is structured as a limited liability company. As a limited liability company, Gyrodyne is not subject to an entity level income tax but rather is treated as a partnership for tax purposes, with its items of income, gain, deduction, loss and credit being reported on the Company’s information return, on Form 1065, and allocated annually on Schedule K-1 to its members pro rata.
 
Prior to January 1, 2018, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) would determine adjustments of income and deductions at the partnership level when auditing partnership tax returns, but was required to collect any additional taxes, interest and penalties from each of the partners.
 
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the “2015 Act”) changed this procedure for partnership tax audits and audit adjustments for partnership returns of large partnerships for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017. Pursuant to the 2015 Act, if any audit by the IRS of our income tax returns for any fiscal year beginning after December 31, 2017 results in any adjustments, the IRS may collect any resulting taxes, including any applicable penalties and interest, directly from Gyrodyne. IRS tax audit assessments on tax years beginning January 1, 2018 will require Gyrodyne to a) bear any tax liability resulting from such audit, or b) elect to push out the tax audit adjustments to the respective shareholders once it has been calculated at the company level.
 
Competition
 
Our properties are located in St. James and Cortlandt Manor, New York. The Company competes in the leasing of medical, professional and general office space and engineering, manufacturing and warehouse space with a considerable number of other real estate companies, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than the Company and may generally be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risk with respect to creditworthiness of tenants.  These entities and others may be prospective buyers, as well as competitors, with respect to both properties when we expect to sell such properties, which would be following the receipt of entitlements. Principal factors of competition in the Company’s rental property business are the quality of properties, leasing terms (including rent and other charges and allowances for tenant improvements), attractiveness and convenience of location, financial strength of its competitors, the quality and breadth of tenant services provided and reputation as an owner and operator of quality office properties in its relevant market. Additionally, the Company’s ability to compete depends upon, among other factors, trends in the national and local economies, investment alternatives, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends. 
 
In pursuit of its business plan, and the sale of properties, the Company competes with other real estate investors, including pension funds, insurance companies, foreign investors, real estate partnerships, public and private real estate investment trusts, private individuals and other domestic real estate companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources than the Company. With respect to properties presently owned by the Company, it competes with other owners of like properties for tenants. 
 
Internal Growth and Effective Asset Management
 
Tenant Relations and Lease Compliance. We strive to maintain strong contacts with our tenants in order to understand their current and future real estate rental and development needs. We directly monitor each of our rental properties to ensure they are properly maintained and meet the needs of our tenants.
Extending Lease Maturities. We seek to extend leases at the Flowerfield Industrial Park in advance of expirations to achieve high occupancy levels. Additionally, our strategy includes expanding our leasing relationship with Stony Brook University which we believe will enhance the value of the existing buildings as well as the entitlements being pursued.
 
We are seeking to covert the Cortlandt Manor leases to predominantly short-term leases to allow prospective buyers the maximum flexibility to begin development following receipt of site approvals. The entitlements being pursued, if secured, would allow for a 100,000 square foot medical building and a 200-unit multitenant residential building.
 
Financing Strategy
 
The Company believes it is currently well capitalized with adequate cash levels to operate our business and complete our strategic plan of positioning our remaining properties for sale at enhanced values and making liquidating distributions to our shareholders. The Company focuses its available capital to operate the Company and pursue the entitlements strategy.

To finance the capital improvements, most of which relate to leasing activity, the Company secured a non-revolving credit line for up to $3,000,000 (the “Original Line”) with a bank, which closed on March 21, 2018. There was an interest only phase for the first eight months of the loan (“Interest-Only Phase”) after which it automatically converts to a permanent loan maturing on November 30, 2025 (84 months after conversion to a permanent loan) (the “Permanent Phase”). The interest rate during the Interest-Only Phase shall be a variable rate equal to the daily highest prime rate published by the Wall Street Journal plus 100 basis points (1% rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent).  During the Permanent Phase, the Company will pay interest at a fixed rate based on the Federal Home Loan Bank rate for a 7-year maturity as made available by the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York plus a margin of 200 basis points (2%) rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent but in no event less than 4.25%, plus principal based on a 20-year amortization period. The Permanent Phase interest rate currently would be 5.125%. 
 
On January 24, 2019, the Company amended and extended the Original Line which included extending the maturity date of the interest only phase to the earlier of January 20, 2020 or upon drawing down a total of $3,000,000 after which it automatically converts to a permanent loan maturing on the earlier of January 20, 2027 or 84 months after conversion to a permanent loan (the “Permanent Phase”).  The interest rate during the Interest-Only Phase shall be a variable rate equal to the daily highest prime rate published by the Wall Street Journal plus 100 basis points (1% rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent), but in no event less than the initial interest rate in effect on the closing date (6.5%).  During the Permanent Phase, the Company will pay interest at a fixed rate based on the Federal Home Loan Bank rate for a 7-year maturity as made available by the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York plus a margin of 200 basis points (2%) rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent, plus principal based on a 20-year amortization period.  The Permanent Phase interest rate currently would be 5.125%.  The first advance, drawn in March 2018, of $1.1 million was used to finance the work required for the lease amendment with Stony Brook University Hospital. The Company intends to draw an additional $1.1 million in 2019 to fund additional tenant improvements related to leases signed through December 31, 2018.
 
To secure access to additional working capital, if needed, through the final sale date of the Flowerfield industrial buildings, the Company secured a second loan evidenced by a secured non-revolving business line of credit agreement and promissory note with a bank for up to $3,000,000, which closed on January 24, 2019. There is an interest only phase for the first twenty-four months of the loan (“Interest-Only Phase”) after which it automatically converts to a permanent loan maturing on January 20, 2028 (84 months after conversion to a permanent loan) (the “Permanent Phase”). The interest rate during the Interest-Only Phase shall be a variable rate equal to the daily highest prime rate published by the Wall Street Journal plus 100 basis points (1% rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent), but in no event less than the initial interest rate in effect on the closing date (6.5%). During the Permanent Phase, the Company will pay interest at a fixed rate based on the Federal Home Loan Bank rate for a 7-year maturity as made available by the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York plus a margin of 200 basis points (2%) rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent, plus principal based on a 20-year amortization period. The Permanent Phase interest rate currently would be 5.125%. The balance of $2,919,932 net of closing costs of $80,068, is available to be drawn down.
 
Both are secured by approximately 31.8 acres of the Flowerfield Industrial Park including the related buildings and leases. The only significant financial covenant associated with the loan is a debt service ratio on GSD Flowerfield, LLC of 1.35 to 1. The Company is in compliance with the loan covenants. The Company anticipates modifying the terms of the loan following the completion of its subdivision.   
 
Special Distributions. On June 16, 2017, the Company declared a Special cash distribution on the Company’s shares of limited liability company interests of $1.00 per share, or $1,482,680 in the aggregate, paid on July 7, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 27, 2017.
Environmental Matters
 
We may order, on any of our properties, a Phase 1 environmental report and, when necessary, a Phase 2 environmental report. Based on a review of such reports, and our ongoing review of each of our properties, as of the date of this report, we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of the properties which we believe would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or results of operations. There can be no assurance that (i) changes in law, (ii) the conduct of tenants, (iii) activities related to properties in the surrounding area, (iv) contamination through the water table due to the low elevation and immediate proximity of the industrial park to the Long Island Sound or (v) the discovery of environmental conditions the extent or severity of which were unknown, will not expose us to material liability in the future.
 
The Company believes that each of its properties is in compliance, in all material respects, with federal, state and local regulations regarding hazardous waste and other environmental matters and is not aware of any environmental contamination at any of its properties that would require any material capital expenditure for the remediation thereof. No assurance can be given, however, that environmental regulations will not in the future have a materially adverse effect on the properties.
 
Insurance
 
The Company carries comprehensive liability, property, terrorism and umbrella insurance coverage which includes fire, flood, earthquakes and business interruption insurance on all our properties. The Company annually reviews its policies with regard to both risk management and the underlying premiums and believes the policy specifications, insurance limits and deductibles are appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice and, in the opinion of the Company’s management, all its properties are adequately insured.

Major Tenants
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, pro forma rental income (excluding revenue related to assets sold on or prior to December 31, 2018) from the three largest tenants represented approximately 21%, 21% and 6% of total rental income.
 
The three largest tenants by revenue as of December 31, 2018, consist of Stony Brook University Hospital, located in the industrial park and two medical tenants in the Cortlandt Manor Medical Center.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2017, pro forma rental income (excluding revenue related to assets sold on or prior to December 31, 2018) from the three largest tenants represented approximately 16%, 11% and 7% of total rental income.
 
The three largest tenants by revenue as of December 31, 2017, consisted of a state agency located in the industrial park, another tenant in the industrial park (which vacated in August 2017) and a medical tenant in the Cortlandt Manor Medical Center.
 
The current economic challenges facing state and local budgets impacted all 3 of the Company’s largest tenants. During 2018, one of these tenants signed an amendment to its existing lease with us, including a seven-year extension of lease term and a 93% expansion of the existing space with a 23.3% reduction in rental rate per square foot. There can be no assurance that the remaining leases will renew for the same square footage, at favorable rates net of tenant improvements, if at all.
 
Fiscal Year 2018 Transaction Summary
 
The following summarizes our significant transactions and other activity during the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
Financing Activity.  To finance capital improvements, most of which relate to leasing activity, the Company secured a non-revolving credit line for up to $3,000,000 (the “Original Line”) with a bank, which closed on March 21, 2018.  There was an interest only phase for the first eight months of the loan (“Interest-Only Phase”) after which it automatically converts to a permanent loan maturing on November 30, 2025 (84 months after conversion to a permanent loan) (the “Permanent Phase”).  The interest rate during the Interest-Only Phase shall be a variable rate equal to the daily highest prime rate published by the Wall Street Journal plus 100 basis points (1% rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent).  During the Permanent Phase, the Company will pay interest at a fixed rate based on the Federal Home Loan Bank rate for a 7-year maturity as made available by the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York plus a margin of 200 basis points (2%) rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent but in no event less than 4.25%, plus principal based on a 20-year amortization period.  The Permanent Phase interest rate currently would be 5.125%. 
 
On January 24, 2019, the Company amended and extended the Original Line which included extending the maturity date of the interest only phase to the earlier of January 20, 2020 or upon drawing down a total of $3,000,000 after which it automatically converts to a permanent loan maturing on the earlier of January 20, 2027 or 84 months after conversion to a permanent loan (the “Permanent Phase).  The interest rate during the Interest-Only Phase shall be a variable rate equal to the daily highest prime rate published by the Wall Street Journal plus 100 basis points (1% rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent), but in no event less than the initial interest rate in effect on the closing date (6.5%).  During the Permanent Phase, the Company will pay interest at a fixed rate based on the Federal Home Loan Bank rate for a 7-year maturity as made available by the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York plus a margin of 200 basis points (2%) rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent, plus principal based on a 20-year amortization period.  The Permanent Phase interest rate currently would be 5.125%.  The first advance, drawn in March 2018, of $1.1 million was used to finance the work required for the lease amendment with Stony Brook University Hospital. The Company intends to draw an additional $1.1 million in 2019 to fund additional tenant improvements related to leases signed through December 31, 2018.
 
The line is secured by approximately 31.8 acres of the Flowerfield Industrial Park including the related buildings and leases. The only significant financial covenant associated with the loan is a debt service ratio on GSD Flowerfield, LLC of 1.35 to 1. The Company is in compliance with the loan covenants. The Company anticipates modifying the terms of the loan following the completion of its subdivision.  
 
Disposition Activity. On August 31, 2018, the Company sold the final building located in the Port Jefferson Professional Park, 11 Medical Drive, for $800,000. 
 
Leasing Activity. During 2018, the Company signed six new leases comprising 9,565 square feet, annual base rent of approximately $142,900 and total lease commitments of approximately $867,500, excluding tenant reimbursements, at an average rate per square foot of $14.94, which were offset by five terminations comprising 3,350 square feet, approximately $39,400 in annual revenue, excluding tenant reimbursements at an average rate per square foot of $11.77. The net impact was an increase in annual lease commitments and rented square footage of approximately $103,500 and 6,200 square feet, respectively. A total of nineteen lease renewals were signed during 2018 comprising approximately 31,400 square feet, $366,500 in annual revenue and $535,500 in total commitments. In addition, there were a total of five expansion/downsizing signed in 2018 with a net increase of approximately 17,500 square feet, $118,900 in annual revenue and $5,112,000 in total commitments. The aforementioned leasing activity was all related to the Industrial Park; none of the 2018 leasing activity relate to buildings sold during 2018. As a result, the aforementioned activity is the same on a proforma basis to exclude assets sold. The Company provided approximately $1,737,000 in incentives in the form of tenant improvements and lease concessions in the form of rent abatement of approximately $46,000. The Company also paid commissions of approximately $348,000.

Retention Bonus Plan
 
In May 2014, the Board of Directors approved a retention bonus plan (as amended, the “Plan”) designed to recognize the nature and scope of the responsibilities of our directors, executives and employees related to the Company’s strategic plan to enhance the property values, liquidate and dissolve, to reward and incent performance in connection therewith, to align the interests of directors, executives and employees with our shareholders and to retain such persons during the term of such plan.  The Plan provides for bonuses to directors, officers and employees determined by the gross sales proceeds from the sale of each property and the date of sale. 
 
The Plan provides for a bonus pool that would be funded with an amount equal to 5% of the specified Adjusted Appraised Value of such properties (set forth in the Plan), so long as the gross selling price of the property is equal to or greater than 100% of its 2013 Adjusted Appraised Value as designated in the bonus plan.  The aggregate amount of the 2013 appraisals for the Company’s properties was utilized by the Company to help set the aggregate valuation of the real estate that was included in the non-cash dividend distributed on December 30, 2013.  Additional funding of the bonus pool would occur on a property-by-property basis when the gross sales price of a property exceeds the Adjusted Appraised Value defined as the sum of (i) its 2013 appraised value and (ii) land development costs incurred on a property since the date of the 2013 appraisal, as follows: 10% on the first 10% of appreciation, 15% on the next 10% of appreciation and 20% on appreciation greater than 20%.
 
The bonus pool is distributable in the following proportions to the named participants in the bonus plan for so long as they are directors or employees of the Company:
 

Board Members/Employees | Bonus Pool Percentage
---------------------------------+----------------------
Board Members (a) | 65.000% 
Chief Executive Officer | 15.474% 
Chief Operations Officer | 13.926% 
Officer Discretionary Amount (b) | 1.750% 
Other Employees | 3.850% 
Total | 100.000% 


(a) | 15% for the Chairman and 50% for the directors other than the Chairman (10% for each of the other five directors). 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | The officer discretionary amount of 1.75% is vested but not allocated and will be allocated to the officers within the discretion of the Board.

 
Such shares of the bonus pool are earned only upon the completion of the sale of a property at a gross selling price equal to or greater than its Adjusted Appraised Value and is paid to the named beneficiaries of the Plan or their designees within 60 days of the completion of such sale or, if later, within 60 days of receipt of any subsequent post-completion installment payment related to such sale.
 
The Plan provides for vesting of benefits upon the sale of each individual post-subdivision lot at Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor. It also provides for entitlement to a future benefit in the event of death, voluntary termination following substantial reduction in compensation or board fees, mutually agreed separation to right-size the board or involuntary termination without cause, except that a participant will only be eligible to receive a benefit to the extent that a property is sold within three years following the separation event and the sale produces an internal rate of return equal to at least four percent of the property’s value as of December 31 immediately preceding such event and that the sale exceeded the Adjusted Appraised Value.
 
There have been three amendments to the Plan, the first two of which were approved on May 24, 2016 and January 26, 2018, respectively.  On October 30, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company approved Amendment No. 3 to the Plan (“Amendment No. 3”).  Amendment No. 3 amends the Plan to provide that no benefits are to be paid to participants from the sale of any individual post-subdivided lot from either of the Company’s Flowerfield or Cortlandt Manor properties until aggregate sale proceeds from all sales of post-subdivided lots from such property exceed a designated aggregate floor for such property.  The aggregate floor for each of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties is defined in Amendment No. 3 as the 2013 appraisal of such property plus land development costs incurred for such property since such appraisal.

Payments made during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 under the Plan relating to the sale of one building in the Port Jefferson Professional Park were as follows:
 

RETENTION BONUS PLAN PARTICIPANTS | Total 
----------------------------------+---------
Board of Directors | $56,497 
Chief Executive Officer | 14,250 
Chief Operating Officer | 12,824 
Other Employees | 3,346

Subsequent Business Events
 
Leasing Activity. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, the Company signed three lease extensions comprising approximately 3,200 square feet, $45,000 in annual revenue and $89,000 in total lease commitments. Additionally, the Company signed one expansion and one reduction comprising no change in leased square footage but an increase in annual revenue of approximately $2,700 and $4,700 in total lease commitments.   
 
Subsequent to December 31, 2018, the Company has experienced three lease terminations comprising approximately 6,200 square feet with approximately $153,000 in annual revenue.
 
Credit Facility. On January 24, 2019, the Company amended and extended the non-revolving credit line with a bank which included extending the maturity date of the interest only phase to the earlier of January 20, 2020 (originally November 30, 2018) or upon drawing down a total of $3,000,000 after which it automatically converts to a permanent loan maturing 84 months after conversion to a permanent loan (the “Permanent Phase”). The interest rate during the Interest-Only Phase shall be a variable rate equal to the daily highest prime rate published by the Wall Street Journal plus 100 basis points (1% rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent), but in no event less than the initial interest rate in effect on the closing date (6.5%).  During the Permanent Phase, the Company will pay interest at a fixed rate based on the Federal Home Loan Bank rate for a 7-year maturity as made available by the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York plus a margin of 200 basis points (2%) rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent, plus principal based on a 20-year amortization period.  The Permanent Phase interest rate currently would be 5.125%.  The first advance, drawn in March 2018, of $1.1 million was used to finance the work required for the lease amendment with Stony Brook University Hospital. The Company intends to draw an additional $1.1 million in 2019 to fund additional tenant improvements related to leases signed through December 31, 2018.
 
To secure access to additional working capital, if needed, through the final sale date of the Flowerfield industrial buildings, the Company secured a second loan evidenced by a secured non-revolving Business Line of Credit Agreement and Promissory Note with a bank for up to $3,000,000, which closed on January 24, 2019. There is an interest only phase for the first twenty-four months of the loan (“Interest-Only Phase”) after which it automatically converts to a permanent loan maturing on January 20, 2028 (84 months after conversion to a permanent loan) (the “Permanent Phase”). The interest rate during the Interest-Only Phase shall be a variable rate equal to the daily highest prime rate published by the Wall Street Journal plus 100 basis points (1% rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent), but in no event less than the initial interest rate in effect on the closing date (6.5%). During the Permanent Phase, the Company will pay interest at a fixed rate based on the Federal Home Loan Bank rate for a 7-year maturity as made available by the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York plus a margin of 200 basis points (2%) rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent, plus principal based on a 20-year amortization period. The Permanent Phase interest rate currently would be 5.125%. The balance of $2,919,932 net of closing costs of $80,068, is available to be drawn down.
 
Both loans are secured by approximately 31.8 acres of the Flowerfield Industrial Park including the respective buildings and related leases. The only significant financial covenant associated with the loan is a debt service ratio on GSD Flowerfield, LLC of 1.35 to 1. The Company is in compliance with the loan covenants. The Company anticipates modifying the terms of the loan following the completion of its subdivision.
