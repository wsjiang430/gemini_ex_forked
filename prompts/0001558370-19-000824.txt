 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 WHO ARE WE AND WHAT DO WE DO
 Aptar is a leading global supplier of a broad range of innovative dispensing, sealing and active packaging solutions for the beauty, personal care, home care, prescription drug, consumer health care, injectables, food and beverage markets. Aptar uses insights, design, engineering and science to create innovative packaging technologies that build brand value for its customers, and, in turn, make a meaningful difference in the lives, looks, health and homes of people around the world. Aptar is headquartered in Crystal Lake, Illinois and has over 14,000 dedicated employees in 18 different countries. For more information, visit www.aptar.com.
 Our business was started in the late 1940’s, manufacturing and selling aerosol valves in the United States, and has grown primarily through acquisitions and internal expansion. We were incorporated in Delaware in 1992. In this report, we may refer to AptarGroup, Inc. and its subsidiaries as “AptarGroup”, “Aptar” or the “Company”.
 We have manufacturing facilities located throughout the world including North America, Europe, Asia and South America. We have approximately 5,000 customers with no single customer or group of affiliated customers accounting for greater than 6% of our 2018 Net Sales. 
 Consumers’ preference for convenience and product differentiation through packaging design and function are important to our customers and they have converted many of their packages from non-dispensing formats to dispensing systems that offer enhanced shelf appeal, convenience, cleanliness and accuracy of dosage. 
 While we offer a wide variety of dispensing, sealing and active packaging solutions, our primary products are dispensing pumps, closures, aerosol valves and elastomeric primary packaging components.
 Dispensing pumps are finger‑actuated dispensing systems that dispense a spray or lotion from non‑pressurized containers. The style of pump used depends largely on the nature of the product being dispensed, from small, fine mist pumps used with perfume and pharmaceutical products to lotion pumps for more viscous formulas.
 Closures are primarily dispensing closures but to a lesser degree can include non‑dispensing closures. Dispensing closures are plastic caps that allow a product to be dispensed without removing the cap.
 Aerosol valves dispense product from pressurized containers. The majority of the aerosol valves that we sell are continuous spray valves, with the balance being metered dose valves.
 We also manufacture and sell elastomeric primary packaging components. These components are used in the injectables market. Products include stoppers for infusion, antibiotic, lyophilization and diagnostic vials. Our elastomeric components also include pre‑filled syringe components, such as plungers, needle shields, tip caps and cartridges, as well as dropper bulbs and syringe plungers.
 On August 27, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition (the “CSP Technologies Acquisition”) of all of the outstanding capital stock of CSP Technologies S.à r.l. (“CSP Technologies”). CSP Technologies is a leader in active packaging technology based on proprietary material science expertise for the pharma and food service markets. The active packaging technologies protect and enhance the performance of our customers’ products. On May 1, 2018, we acquired 100% of the common stock of Reboul SAS (“Reboul”).  Reboul is a French manufacturer specializing in stamping, decorating and assembling metal and plastic packaging for the cosmetics and luxury markets.

 DESCRIPTION OF OUR REPORTING SEGMENTS
 INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS
 Our organizational structure consists of three market‑focused business segments: Beauty + Home, Pharma and Food + Beverage. This is a strategic structure which allows us to be more closely aligned with our customers and the markets in which they operate. We primarily sell our products through our own sales force to beauty, personal care, pharmaceutical, home care, food and beverage marketers. To a limited extent, we use independent representatives and distributors to increase our reach to smaller customers and export markets.  
 Operations that sell dispensing systems and sealing solutions primarily to the beauty, personal care and home care markets form the Beauty + Home segment. Operations that sell dispensing systems and sealing solutions to the prescription drug, consumer health care, injectables and active packaging markets form the Pharma segment. Operations that sell dispensing systems and sealing solutions to the food and beverage markets form the Food + Beverage segment. Each of these three business segments is described more fully below.
 BEAUTY + HOME
 The Beauty + Home segment is our largest segment in terms of net sales and total assets representing 52% and 41% of our Net Sales and Total Assets, respectively, in 2018. The Beauty + Home segment primarily sells pumps, closures, aerosol valves, accessories and sealing solutions to the personal care and home care markets and pumps and decorative components to the beauty market. We believe we are a leading supplier for the majority of the products we sell primarily to the beauty and personal care markets.
 Beauty. Sales to the beauty market accounted for approximately 49% of the segment’s total net sales in 2018. The beauty market requires a broad range of spray and lotion pumps, closures, elastomeric flow-control components and sampling dispensing systems to meet functional as well as aesthetic requirements. A considerable amount of research, time and coordination with our customers is required to qualify a pump for use with their products. Within the market, we expect the use of pumps to continue to increase, particularly in the cosmetics and sampling sectors. In the cosmetic sector, packaging for certain products such as natural and organic cosmetics and anti‑aging lotions continue to provide us with growth opportunities. We are a leading provider of packaging solutions for prestige and mass market fragrance products. Our cosmetic lotion pumps, airless dispensing systems, lotion sampling devices and decorative capabilities along with our focus on color cosmetics including lip stick and lip gloss products will also provide growth opportunities. We see continued growth opportunities in Latin America and significant opportunities for growth in the sale of our products for cosmetic applications in Asia.

 Personal Care. Sales to the personal care market accounted for approximately 44% of the segment’s total net sales in 2018 and primarily included sales of fine mist spray pumps, lotion pumps, closures, elastomeric flow-control components and continuous spray aerosol valves. Personal care spray pump applications include hair care, body care and sun care products. Typical lotion pump applications include skin moisturizers, hand sanitizers and soap. Personal care closures applications include shampoos and conditioners. Personal care continuous spray aerosol valve applications include hair care products, deodorants, shaving creams and sun care products. Our research and development teams continue to design unique accessories that increase the value of our continuous spray aerosol valve offerings.
 Home Care. Sales to the home care market accounted for approximately 7% of the segment’s total net sales in 2018 and primarily included sales of continuous or metered dose spray aerosol valves, closures and to a lesser degree spray and lotion pumps. Applications for continuous spray valves include disinfectants, spray paints, insecticides and automotive products. Metered dose valves are used for air fresheners. Closure applications include liquid detergents, automotive products and household cleansers. Spray and lotion pump applications primarily include household, insect repellant and industrial cleaners. 
 PHARMA
 The Pharma segment is our second largest segment in terms of net sales and total assets, accounting for 34% and 40% of our Net Sales and Total Assets, respectively, in 2018. We believe we are a leading supplier of pumps and metered dose inhaler valves (“MDIs”) to the pharmaceutical market worldwide and we are an important supplier of elastomer for injectable primary packaging components worldwide. Characteristics of this market include (i) governmental regulation of our pharmaceutical customers, (ii) contaminant‑controlled manufacturing environments and (iii) a significant amount of time and research from initially working with pharmaceutical companies at the molecular development stage of a medication through the eventual distribution to the market. We have clean‑room manufacturing facilities in Argentina, China, France, Germany, India, Switzerland and the United States. We believe that providing an alternative to traditional medication forms such as pills with value‑added, convenient dispensing systems will continue to offer opportunities for our business. In addition, we believe there are opportunities for growth in the over-the-counter and generic pharmaceutical categories.
 Prescription Drug. Sales to the prescription drug market accounted for approximately 52% of the segment’s total net sales in 2018. Pumps sold to the prescription drug market deliver medications nasally, orally or topically. Currently the majority of our pumps sold are for nasal allergy treatments. Recently, there is a trend of nasal allergy products moving from prescription‑only to being sold over-the-counter without a prescription. This trend could provide us with growth opportunities as this movement could allow consumers easier access to these types of treatments. Our nasal pumps and unit dose devices are also used to deliver pain management products. Potential opportunities for providing alternatives to traditional pill and injectable dosage forms of medication include pump dispensing systems for vaccines, cold and flu treatments, central nervous systems applications and hormone replacement therapies.
 MDIs are used for dispensing precise amounts of aerosolized medication. This technology allows medication to be broken up into very fine particles, which enables the drug to be delivered typically via the pulmonary system. Currently the majority of our MDIs sold are used for respiratory ailments such as asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
 We continue to develop new dispensing systems and accessories in this segment.  For example, we provide single dose delivery devices suitable for central nervous system applications. While we expect that these types of new products will come to market in the future, it is difficult to estimate when, as the rigors of pharmaceutical regulations affect the timing of product introductions by our pharmaceutical customers that use our dispensing systems.
 Consumer Health Care. Sales to the consumer health care market accounted for approximately 27% of the segment’s total net sales in 2018. Applications for this market are similar to the prescription market; however, these applications are sold over-the-counter without a prescription. Typical consumer health care spray pump applications include nasal decongestants, nasal salines and cough and cold applications. Typical consumer health care valve applications include nasal saline using our bag‑on valve technology. We have developed a multi dose ophthalmic dispensing device suitable for unpreserved formulations. This technology is successfully marketed in Europe, North America and Latin America and is under development for other markets both for over-the-counter and prescription applications. Other products sold to this market include airless pump systems for dermal drug delivery applications. We have recently seen a trend to more child resistant and senior‑friendly packaging solutions and have developed products to meet these market needs.
 Injectables. Sales to the injectables market accounted for approximately 17% of the segment’s total net sales in 2018. Injectables are elastomeric primary packaging components for injectable drug delivery. Injectable products offered include stoppers for vials and pre‑filled syringe components, such as plungers, needle shields, tip caps and components for cartridges. Our recent investment in this business allows us to market coated stoppers which better preserve the contents of the vial and adds value to our customers and the consumer. Pharmaceutical applications for this market include vaccines, anti‑thrombotic, small molecules and biologics.

 Active Packaging. Active packaging is a new technology for Aptar since the CSP Technologies Acquisition in the third quarter of 2018.  Sales of active packaging products accounted for approximately 4% of the segment’s total net sales in 2018 since acquisition. Through proprietary material science expertise, we deliver active packaging solutions such as desiccant material to enhance the shelf life and effectiveness of diagnostic and solid dose products.
 FOOD + BEVERAGE
 The Food + Beverage segment is our smallest segment in terms of net sales and total assets representing 14% of our Net Sales and Total Assets in 2018, but has been experiencing strong product growth over recent years. We primarily sell dispensing closures and, to a lesser degree, non‑dispensing closures, elastomeric flow control components, spray pumps and aerosol valves.
 Sales of dispensing closures have grown as consumers worldwide have demonstrated a preference for a package utilizing the convenience of a dispensing closure. At the same time, consumer marketers are trying to differentiate their products by incorporating performance enhancing features such as bonded aluminum liners to plastic, flow‑control and no‑drip dispensing, inverted packaging and directional flow to make packages simpler to use, cleaner and more appealing to consumers.  We also have a number of product solutions that address the increased use of flexible packaging formats.
 Food. Sales to the food market accounted for approximately 64% of the segment’s total net sales in 2018 and primarily include sales of dispensing closures and elastomeric flow‑control components. To a lesser degree we also sell non‑dispensing closures, continuous spray aerosol valves and spray pumps to this market. Applications for dispensing closures include sauces, condiments, infant nutrition and other food products. Applications for continuous spray aerosol valves include cooking sprays. Spray pump applications primarily include butter or salad dressing sprays. With the completion of the CSP Technologies Acquisition in the third quarter of 2018, we have started to sell and further develop packaging solutions to the food service market to enhance the shelf life of those products.
 Beverage. Sales to the beverage market accounted for approximately 36% of the segment’s total net sales in 2018 and primarily include sales of dispensing closures and elastomeric flow‑control components. Sales of dispensing closures to the beverage market have increased significantly over the last several years as we continue to see an increase of interest from marketers using dispensing closures for their products. Examples of beverage products currently utilizing dispensing closures include bottled water, sport and energy drinks, juices and concentrated water flavorings.
 GENERAL BUSINESS INFORMATION
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 Our commitment to innovation, one of our competitive strengths, has resulted in an emphasis on research and development directed toward developing affordable, new, innovative packaging delivery solutions and adapting existing products for new markets or customer requirements. In certain cases, our customers share in the research and development expenses of customer initiated projects. Occasionally, we acquire or license from third parties technologies or products that are in various stages of development. PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
 We customarily seek patent and trademark protection for our products and brands. We own and currently have numerous applications pending for patents and trademarks in many regions of the world. In addition, certain of our products are produced under patent licenses granted by third parties. We believe that we possess certain technical capabilities in making our products that make it difficult for a competitor to duplicate. While valuable to our overall product portfolio, sales of any one individually patented product are not considered material to any specific segment or to our consolidated results. TECHNOLOGY
 We have technical expertise regarding injection molding, robotics, clean-room facilities and high‑speed assembly. We also have expertise regarding the formulation and finishing of elastomer and silicone components. In addition, we offer a variety of sterilization options for elastomeric components and active packaging technology based on proprietary material science expertise. Pumps and aerosol valves require the assembly of several different plastic, metal and rubber components using high‑speed equipment. When molding dispensing closures, or plastic components to be used in pump or aerosol valve products, we use advanced plastic injection molding technology, including large cavitation plastic injection molds. We are able to mold within tolerances as small as one one‑thousandth of an inch and we assemble products in a high‑speed, cost‑effective manner. We are experts in molding liquid silicone that is used in certain dispensing closures as well as rubber gasket formulation and production primarily for the prescription drug and consumer health care markets. 
4/ATR | 2018 Form 10-K

 MANUFACTURING AND SOURCING
 The majority of our worldwide production is located outside of the United States. Our philosophy is to produce as much as possible in the region where it will be sold. In order to augment capacity and to maximize internal capacity utilization (particularly for plastic injection molding), we use subcontractors to supply certain plastic, metal and rubber components. Certain suppliers of these components have unique technical abilities that make us dependent on them, particularly for aerosol valve and pump production. The principal raw materials used in our production are plastic resins, silicone, rubber and certain metal products. We believe an adequate supply of such raw materials is available from existing and alternative sources. We attempt to offset cost increases through improving productivity and developing new, higher margin solutions and increasing selling prices, as allowed by market conditions or contractual commitments. We source certain materials, especially some resins and rubber components for our pharmaceutical segment, from a single source. Significant delays in receiving these components or discontinuance of an approved raw material would require us to seek alternative sources, which could result in higher costs as well as impact our ability to supply products in the short-term. BACKLOG
 Our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products. While most orders placed with us are ready for delivery within 120 days, we continue to experience a trend towards shorter lead times requested by our customers. Some customers place blanket orders, which extend beyond this delivery period. However, deliveries against purchase orders are subject to change, and only a small portion of the order backlog is noncancelable. The dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not material. Therefore, we do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is an accurate indicator of future results. CUSTOMERS
 We have approximately 5,000 customers with no single customer or group of affiliated customers accounting for greater than 6% of 2018 Net Sales. A consolidation of our customer base has been occurring and this trend is expected to continue. A concentration of customers presents opportunities for increasing sales due to the breadth of our product line, our international presence and our long‑term relationships with certain customers. However, consolidation of our customers could lead to pricing pressures, concentration of credit risk and fewer opportunities to introduce new products to the market. INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
 We are geographically diverse with manufacturing and sales operations in Asia, Europe, Latin America (including Mexico) and North America.  Europe is our largest region in terms of sales, where sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were approximately 59%, 58% and 57%, respectively, of our consolidated sales. Asia and Latin America when aggregated represented approximately 15%, 16% and 16% of our consolidated sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Export sales from the United States were $171.7 million, $152.8 million and $165.1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We are a net exporter of goods from the U.S. and Europe and a net importer of goods to the Asian and Latin American regions. FOREIGN CURRENCY
 Because of our international presence, movements in exchange rates have a significant impact on the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries. Our primary foreign exchange exposure is to the euro, but we have foreign exchange exposure to the Chinese yuan, Brazilian real, Mexican peso, Swiss franc and other Asian, European and South American currencies. A weakening U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies has an additive translation effect on our financial statements. Conversely, a strengthening U.S. dollar has a dilutive effect. We manage our exposures to foreign exchange principally with forward exchange contracts to economically hedge recorded transactions and firm purchase and sales commitments denominated in foreign currencies. 
 During the quarter ended June 30, 2018, we concluded that Argentina has become a highly inflationary economy primarily based on published estimates, which indicate that Argentina's three-year cumulative inflation rate has exceeded 100%. Beginning July 1, 2018, we applied highly inflationary accounting for our Argentinian subsidiaries. We have changed the functional currency from the Argentinian peso to the U.S. dollar.
 WORKING CAPITAL PRACTICES
 Collection and payment periods tend to be longer for our operations located outside the United States due to local business practices. We have also seen an increasing trend in pressure from certain customers to lengthen their payment terms. As the majority of our products are made to order, we have not needed to keep significant amounts of finished goods inventory to meet customer requirements.  However, some of our contracts specify an amount of finished goods safety stock we are required to maintain.
5/ATR | 2018 Form 10-K

 

 

 To the extent our financial position allows and there is a clear financial benefit, we from time-to-time benefit from early payment discounts with some suppliers.
 EMPLOYEE AND LABOR RELATIONS
 AptarGroup has approximately 14,100 full‑time employees. Of the full‑time employees, approximately 8,700 are located in Europe, 3,000 are located in Asia and South America and the remaining 2,400 are located in North America. The majority of our European and Latin American employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements made at either the local or national level in their respective countries and approximately 130 of the North American employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Termination of employees at certain of our international operations could be costly due to local regulations regarding severance benefits. There were no material work stoppages in 2018 and management considers our employee relations to be satisfactory. COMPETITION
 All of the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we continue to experience price competition in all product lines and markets. Competitors include privately and publicly held entities that range from regional to international companies. We expect the market for our products to remain competitive. We believe our competitive advantages are consistent high levels of innovation, quality and service, geographic diversity, financial strength and stability and breadth of products. Our manufacturing strength lies in the ability to mold complex plastic components and formulate and finish elastomer and silicone components in a cost‑effective manner and to assemble products at high speeds. Our business is somewhat capital intensive and it is becoming more important to our customers that we have global manufacturing capabilities. Both of these serve as barriers to entry for new competitors wanting to enter our business.
 While we have experienced some competition in Europe, Latin America and the United States from low cost Asian suppliers, particularly in the low‑end beauty and personal care market, this has not been significant. Although using low cost Asian suppliers may have a cost advantage, some customers prefer local suppliers citing better quality, better customer service and shorter lead times.  
 ENVIRONMENT
 Our manufacturing operations primarily involve plastic injection molding, automated assembly processes, elastomer and silicone formulation and finishing and, to a limited degree, metal anodization and vacuum metallization of plastic components. Historically, the environmental impact of these processes has been minimal, and we believe we meet current environmental standards in all material respects. To date, our manufacturing operations have not been significantly affected by environmental laws and regulations relating to the environment.
 Recently there is increased interest and awareness from consumers, and from our customers, in environmentally sustainable products, especially through the sourcing of sustainable materials. We are focused on reducing our environmental impacts through product life cycle assessments, sustainable material trials, operational eco-efficiency initiatives and renewable energy sourcing. We have teams dedicated to designing for sustainability by providing products that improve recyclability and use less material.  Aptar has launched products and components in North America and Europe made with post-consumer recycled resins (PCR) and continues to explore additional opportunities for alternative resins and recyclable products. 
 Connecting with other companies through organizations like Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) provides an invaluable opportunity to share best practices and work on larger projects with aligned objectives.
 Future regulations on environmental matters regarding recycling or material inputs could impact our business.
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 Certain of our products are indirectly affected by government regulation. The European Union has passed regulations aimed to reduce marine litter and increase plastic recycling rates. These regulations include the ban of single-use plastics by 2021 and the collection and recycling of more plastics post-consumer use. In some of the United States, regulations oblige food and beverage companies to tether plastic caps to ensure the caps stay with the package, thus improving the likelihood the caps will enter the recycling stream. The potential exists for these types of regulations to expand worldwide. We have established an innovation team that focuses on designing for and converting into more sustainable options like post-consumer recycled resin and Food and Drug Administration approved resin alternatives. We are designing for sustainability by providing products that improve recyclability and use less material, and we offer multiple tethered options. We are also partnering with global and regional thought leaders to drive a more circular economy.
6/ATR | 2018 Form 10-K

 

 

 Demand for aerosol and pump packaging is also affected by government regulations regarding the release of volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) into the atmosphere. Europe and the United States have regulations that require the reduction in the amount of VOCs that can be released into the atmosphere and the potential exists for this type of regulation to expand worldwide. These regulations required certain of our customers to reformulate certain aerosol and pump products, which may have affected the demand for such products. We own patents and have developed systems to function with alternative propellant and product formulations.
 Future government regulations could include healthcare cost containment policies. For example, reviews by various governments to determine the number of drugs, or prices thereof, that will be paid by their insurance systems could affect future sales of our pharmaceutical customers’ products and thus adversely impact our sales to these customers. Such regulation could adversely affect prices of and demand for our pharmaceutical products. We believe that the focus on the cost effectiveness of the use of medications as compared to surgery and hospitalization provides us with an opportunity to expand sales to the pharmaceutical market.
