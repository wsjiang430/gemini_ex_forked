Item 1. Business
Background
 
We have developed transparent electricity-generating liquid coatings (the “SolarWindow™ Coatings”) that can be applied to glass and plastic surfaces to generate electricity. These coatings generate electricity when exposed to natural sun or artificial light; and when exposed to low, shaded, or reflected light.
 
When these electricity-generating coatings are applied to glass and fabricated into a window, these windows could become electricity-generating windows, which could potentially be used on any of the estimated 5.6 million commercial buildings, in the United States alone, which consume almost $150 billion in electricity annually.
 
Over the years, we have achieved numerous important milestones and overcome major technical challenges in the development of our SolarWindow™ technology, including the ability to generate electricity on glass while remaining transparent. In September 2014, we demonstrated SolarWindow™ Coatings to members of the U.S. Congress during the first ever National Lab Day, which was cosponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy.

We have scaled-up the SolarWindow™ technology from a single solar cell – only one-quarter the size of a grain of rice – to a working array of solar cells which form a one-foot by one-foot working prototype – our largest-ever SolarWindow™ module.
 
In early 2017, our SolarWindow™ transparent electricity-generating coatings on glass were successfully processed through the rigorous autoclave system for window glass lamination at a commercial window fabricator. Layered with SolarWindow™ electricity-generating liquid coatings, glass modules were subjected to the extremely high heat and pressure of autoclave equipment located at the fabricator’s facility. Despite the SolarWindow™ modules being subjected to the harsh pressure and temperature conditions, subsequent performance testing confirmed that the modules continued to produce power. This validated that our SolarWindow™ Coatings can be processed in an industrial window fabrication autoclave manufacturing process.
 
Our technological advancements over the past two years now enable us to fabricate a pane of glass coated with our SolarWindow™ technology by simply applying our transparent, electricity-generating coatings onto glass surfaces at room temperature and pressure; this process represents a significant technical achievement which may provide a manufacturing advantage over expensive and cumbersome high temperature and high positive or negative pressure-sensitive manufacturing methods common to conventional solar photovoltaic (“PV”) manufacturing.
 
Our current focus is on the commercialization of products derived from our SolarWindow™ technology. We continue to develop our SolarWindow™ technology and products with the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (the “Alliance”) under the Stevenson-Wydler Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (“CRADA”). The Alliance is the Manager and Operator of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (“NREL”) under the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”).
 
In March 2018 the Company was awarded its first-ever Advanced Materials Manufacturing Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (“AMM CRADA”) from the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s (“EERE”) Advanced Manufacturing Office (“AMO”). The purpose of this project is to develop and demonstrate a unique high-throughput process methodology for semitransparent organic photovoltaic (“OPV”) modules compatible with high process speeds for many different advanced material manufacturing process systems.
 
On August 2, 2017, we entered into a Process Integration and Production Agreement (the “PIPA Agreement”) with Triview Glass Industries, LLC (“Triview”). On September 27, 2019, the Company was notified that Triview, effective on September 27, 2019, would cease operations and would not be able to fulfill its commitment to support SolarWindow and meet its obligations to integrate SolarWindow™ processes into its manufacturing operations and build electricity-generating glass products under the PIPA Agreement. The Company does not believe that the termination of its relationship with Triview will result in any material adverse effect on the Company’s operations. The Company remains focused and continues to:
 

• | Pursue commercial manufacturing partnerships to establish and integrate SolarWindow™ coatings and processes into glass fabrication processes, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop manufacturing lines for the full-scale fabrication of specific SolarWindow™ electricity-generating products.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
To advance the technical and product development, and subsequent commercialization of SolarWindow™ technologies and products, we are seeking technology and product licensing and joint venture arrangements with additional research institutions, commercial partners, glass manufacturing and fabrication facilities, and organizations with established technical competencies, market reach, and mature distribution networks in the building development, solar PV, building-integrated PV, and alternative and renewable energy market industries.

Our Important Business and Technology Development Milestones and Achievements
 
We have been researching, developing, designing and testing our SolarWindow™ technology, as well as developing prototype fabrications of our SolarWindow™ modules, for commercial application of flat and insulated electricity-generating glass products for tall towers and other commercial buildings since November 2006.
 
To date we have achieved a number of important milestones in the development of our technology, including:
 

• | awarded its first-ever advanced materials manufacturing CRADA by the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s (EERE) Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO). The Company was awarded the CRADA after submitting a proposal outlining its process technologies and fabrication methods to the DOE’s Roll-to-Roll Advanced Materials Manufacturing Consortium, led by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and partnering with Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The CRADA will be carried out with the DOE by SolarWindow, ANL, and NREL. We refer to this CRADA as our Advanced Manufacturing Materials or “AMM CRADA” which focuses on high-speed roll-to-roll manufacturing processes of our SolarWindow™ technology.

On September 16, 2010, we publicly unveiled a working four-inch by four-inch prototype of our proprietary SolarWindow™ technology. Scientists at the event powered lights on a scale-model house by exposing our transparent SolarWindow™ to artificial light from fluorescent lamps, mimicking lighting typically installed inside offices.
 
Researchers also repeatedly opened and closed window shades, successfully powering LED lights each time SolarWindow™ was exposed to natural light. This demonstration mimicked outdoor exposure such as sunlight on the exterior façade of commercial buildings – our initial target market and, we believe, a promising early application of the technology.
 
Scientists at the debut event not only demonstrated the ability to generate “voltage” to power lighting, but also revealed the capability of SolarWindowTM to produce “current” needed to power mechanical devices and appliances. Researchers successfully powered the mechanical rotor blades of a small helicopter using only a single, small-scale SolarWindow™ prototype exposed to a solar simulator.
 
In February 2012, we successfully developed the largest OPV device fabricated at NREL at that time, measuring 170cm2, approximately 14 times larger than previous devices of the same type device and structure ever produced at NREL. In March 2012, we, in collaboration with NREL researchers, successfully collected and transported electricity using a virtually 'invisible' conductive wiring system developed for SolarWindow™. The ability to transport electricity on glass windows while remaining transparent is especially important to the eventual deployment of an aesthetically pleasing commercial product. 
 
On March 8, 2014, we made public never-before-seen images of our largest area, high-performance SolarWindow™ arrays. These SolarWindow™ arrays measure over 232 cm² – a significant achievement for size, improving upon our previous achievements at NREL, and produced with highly-uniform, colored tints preferred by commercial window manufacturers for installation on skyscrapers, worldwide. Among the most important criteria for developing SolarWindow™ coating applications for today's skyscrapers is providing a set of neutral colors that remain see-through and are uniform in fabrication. We revealed the Company’s largest-area transparent, OPV SolarWindow™ array that addresses tall-tower and commercial building glass requirements and that also bears the promise of scale-up and manufacturability at large commercial sizes. This SolarWindow™ array is over 35% larger than our previously-fabricated, 170 cm² working module achievement. That prior module was already 14 times larger than the then-previous largest-area OPV module for the same type device structure ever fabricated at the NREL.

In September 2014, we demonstrated SolarWindow™ electricity-generating coatings to Congress during the first ever National Lab Day on Capitol Hill. National Lab Day was cosponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy. On April 8, 2015, Engineers and research scientists at the University of North Carolina Charlotte Energy Production and Infrastructure Center (“UNCC-EPIC”) have independently reviewed and validated our proprietary Power & Economic Model. The Model calculates a financial payback of less than one year for our transparent electricity-generating SolarWindow™ Technology. The UNCC-EPIC team of engineering and science experts independently validated the modeling assumptions, reference data, and technical basis important to calculating our one-year financial payback for SolarWindow™ systems. UNCC-EPIC validation also confirmed our methodology for modeling the performance of competing PV technologies.
 
In May 2015 we announced plans to replace traditional electrical wiring connections with a simplified next-generation system for collecting the power produced by its transparent electricity-generating windows. In addition to reducing costs, ease of electrical installation will be important to window fabricators, glass installers (i.e., glaziers), electricians, and maintenance personnel. The replacement of today's cumbersome methods with our easy power connection system ('module interconnects') is also important for new construction and retrofit applications of SolarWindow™ electricity-generating window modules on skyscrapers and tall towers.
 
On August 20, 2015, we featured a first-ever demonstration of our working, electricity-generating window unit, during our webcast. Webcast participants witnessed clean electricity being generated on a demonstration window unit. Its glass is tinted in a high-demand, high transparency, very light green modules framed in aluminum, popular with architects and developers of commercial towers – our target market. Participants also heard us explain exactly how we plan to: generate revenue, work towards product development and getting SolarWindow ™ ready for commercial manufacturing, build shareholder value, expand our name recognition and branding plans, increase investor outreach, engage media, and outlined important next steps for commercialization and bring SolarWindow™ products to market.
 
On May 17, 2017, we announced the successful processing of our SolarWindow™ transparent electricity-generating coatings on glass through the rigorous autoclave system for window glass lamination at a commercial window fabricator. Layered with SolarWindow™ electricity-generating liquid coatings, glass modules were subjected to the extremely high heat and pressure of autoclave equipment located at the fabricator’s facility. Despite the SolarWindow™ modules being subjected to the harsh pressure and temperature conditions, subsequent performance testing confirmed that the modules continued to produce power.
 
Product Development Utilizing our SolarWindowTM Technology
 
We are currently developing seven (7) products (collectively, the “SolarWindow™ Products”) based on our SolarWindow™ technology:
 

• | SolarWindow™ – Commercial – A flat glass product for installation in new commercial towers under construction and replacement windows;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SolarWindow™ – Structural Glass – Structural glass walls and curtains for tall structures;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SolarWindow™ – Architectural Glass – Textured and decorative interior glass walls, room dividers, etc.;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SolarWindow™ – Residential – A window glass for installation in new residential homes under construction and replacement windows;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SolarWindow™ – Flex – Flexible glass and plastic films which may be applied directly to different surfaces;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SolarWindow™ - PowerWrap™ - A proprietary product under development that plans to feature multiple colors and high-power production; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SolarWindow™ Retrofit Veneer - Transparent, tinted, and flexible veneers that installers can apply directly on to existing, previously installed, window glass.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, we are concentrating on the development and deployment of SolarWindow™-Commercial, Structural, Architectural, and Retrofit Veneer glass products.
 
The SolarWindow™ Retrofit Veneer products are transparent, tinted, flexible and rigid veneers that installers can apply directly over the inside of existing windows. This expanded product line broadens our market reach beyond new and replacement installations, to include windows currently installed on the estimated five million commercial buildings constructed in the U.S. alone. The SolarWindow™ Retrofit Veneer products will be developed concurrently with the other SolarWindow™ products currently under development.
 
Although our efforts have already produced the basis for these prototype applications, commercialization of the SolarWindowTM technology will require significant further product development, fabrication, testing, and validation, much of which will be supported by our technology development CRADA and our AMM CRADA grant. This and additional work should enable us to ascertain whether the SolarWindowTM technology can serve as the basis for a commercially viable technology or product, and, ultimately, be manufactured.
 
Our Industry and Market Opportunity
 
Overview
 
From a total glass market perspective, global production of flat glass is forecast to rise 4 percent per year through 2021 to 11 billion square meters.
 
According to the International Energy Outlook 2017 (IEO2017) released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), world energy consumption is projected to increase by 28% by 2040.
 
The United States is the world’s largest consumer of electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, with nearly 70% of the nation’s electricity generated by coal and natural gas; 50% of the total U.S. electrical generation relies on coal, a fossil fuel. The environmental impact and rising costs of these non-renewable fuels, along with the potential doubling of global electricity consumption in the coming years, illustrate the need for more creative, sustainable methods for generating electrical power. A forecast of U.S. electricity demand shows an expected increase is usage of 40% by 2032.
 
We believe that the SolarWindow™ Products will uniquely address a growing market opportunity for technologies able to generate sustainable electricity, without taking up the large amount of land needed for utility scale solar farms or requiring large roof-top area that simply doesn’t exist on a skyscraper. Rising energy costs, increasing electricity consumption, and the need for a cleaner alternative to today’s non-renewable energy sources, all contribute to the growing demand for clean, renewable alternative energy sources. Renewable energy, especially solar and wind has reached a key tipping point whereby many renewable energy projects can compete directly with fossil fuel power plants without subsidies. Legislation or fiscal support may no longer be needed to drive the growth and commercialization of renewable energy including PV solar power. Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) allows solar modules to be added to a building at marginal extra costs. Our goal is that integrating SolarWindow™ products into buildings may present an opportunity of a marginal cost above a regular commercial window cost because the cost of installing windows is already factored into the building or renovation costs.
 
The Market Opportunity for our SolarWindow™ Technology and Products
 
Based on our initial market research, there are no commercially marketed OPV transparent glass window products similar to our SolarWindow™ device technology capable of generating electricity available for sale in the United States. We believe our SolarWindow™ technology, as well as the products that may be derived from our SolarWindow™ technology, could be uniquely positioned as first-to-market, if our commercial launch is timely.

Unprecedented levels of government initiatives, heightened residential demand for green construction, and improvements in sustainable materials are driving green building. Although percentages vary from country to country, buildings are responsible for about 30–45% of the global energy demand in developed countries. Governments (both locally at e.g. State level and nationally) are putting increased focus on legislation and policies to improve their energy efficiency, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. In North America, initiatives such as the environmental building rating system (LEED) run by the U.S. Green Building Council are helping to transform the market for added-value glazing, and this trend is expected to continue. We anticipate similar opportunities in Europe, through the development of a European Union-wide energy labeling system for windows.
 
Our SolarWindow™ Products are under development for building window glass application, often referred to as “architectural flat glass” and “fabricated glass products.” In 2010, an industry report on flat glass by Pilkington, a major global glass manufacturer, noted that the ten largest cities in the United States had more than 444 million square feet of architectural flat glass. We believe that this market is growing in volume, with global growth reported to be approximately 4-5% annually, with Europe, China and North America accounting for over 70% of global demand, according to the same report. Market research reports estimate the flat glass market was valued at USD 108.51 billion in 2018, and it is expected to reach a value of USD 180.79 billion by 2024, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.33%, over the forecast period, 2019 - 2024.

Competition for SolarWindow™ Technology and Products
 
The solar PV industry is highly competitive and such competition is increasing as the number of participants in the industry continues to grow. Although we are not aware of other products utilizing technology substantially similar to our SolarWindow™ technology, numerous solar cell technologies have been developed, or are being developed, by a number of companies, from which products may be derived and ultimately compete with the SolarWindow™ Products.
 
Such technologies include, but are not necessarily limited to, the use of organic materials, advanced crystalline silicon thin film concepts, amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride, copper-indium-gallium-selenide, titanium dioxide, and copper indium di-selenide, and others to generate electricity from sun light. Given sufficient time, investment and advances in manufacturing technologies, any of these competing technologies may achieve lower manufacturing costs, superior performance, or greater market acceptance than our SolarWindow™ Products, currently under development.
 
We face competition from many companies, major universities and research institutions in the United States and abroad. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources, experience in conducting research, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for their products, operating experience, research and development and marketing capabilities name recognition and production capabilities. We will face competition from companies marketing existing products or developing new products which may render our technologies (and hence future products) obsolete.
 
The descriptions of the products and technologies being developed or marketed by our competitors listed below have been taken from publicly available documents or reports filed by these companies:
 

• | Ubiquitous Energy is a company that began at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is initially moving toward the electronics (tablet & E-reader, cell phone) market. Their first product seems to be a very clear, high visible light transmission (“VLT”), low efficiency charging system for the electronics market;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Solarmer is developing organic photovoltaic or OPV technology, targeting portable power, off-grid power, and building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) markets. Solarmer will utilize its materials, devices, and roll-to-roll process technology to manufacture OPV modules with strategic partners throughout the world. Solarmer sells and provides OPV modules to product developers and system integrators who will integrate them into various products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ONYX Solar is a new type of solar company, while they are not an OPV material company, the company is considered a competitor in the space for generating power under low light conditions. Their current technology is mixture of semitransparent amorphous Si, Crystalline Si and possibly Copper, Indium, Gallium, Selenide (CIS or CIGS) and is also working on OPV. They are currently in production, and are generating revenue; and

These companies may have numerous competitive advantages, including:
 

• | significantly greater name recognition;
--+----------------------------------------


• | established distribution networks;
--+-----------------------------------


• | more advanced technologies and product development;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates, higher discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | processes that are operational and manufacturing prototype or final products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, obtaining regulatory approval for products, and marketing approved products; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | significantly greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing, and patent litigation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If our competitors were to succeed in developing products that are more effective in producing electrical energy at a lower cost than our SolarWindow™ technology, some or all of our SolarWindow™ Products or our technology could be rendered obsolete and non-competitive. Accordingly, in addition to our research and development efforts, we have undertaken a public relations, advertising, and market access outreach programs designed to establish our “brand” name recognition early on in our corporate development; we intend to continue to develop and market our brand name pending commercialization of products, if any, we may derive from our research and development efforts. We believe our strategy ultimately will facilitate the marketing, distribution and public acceptance of any products we may derive from our research and development efforts, if and when any applicable regulatory approval is received.
 
Our commercial success will depend on our ability and the ability of our licensee or sub-licensees, if any, to compete effectively in product development areas such as, but not limited to: safety, reliability, availability, price, marketing, distribution and patent position.
 
Our competitive position in the market will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, to obtain patent protection, develop proprietary products and processes, and to secure sufficient capital resources for the often substantial period between technology development and commercial sales.
 
An important factor will be the timing of market introduction of any SolarWindowTM products we develop. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop our SolarWindow™ products, complete safety approvals processes and ultimately supply commercial quantities of any products we develop to the market is expected to be an important competitive factor.
