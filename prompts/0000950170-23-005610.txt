 Item 1. Business
 On February 28, 2023, we completed the acquisition of certain assets relating to the flow cytometry and imaging business of Luminex Corporation. The information set forth under this “Business” section relates primarily to our business of developing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our full spectrum flow cytometers and related reagents, software and services. For information relating to the acquisition, please refer to the subsections entitled "Recent Developments—FCI Acquisition.”
Overview
 We are a leading cell analysis solutions company advancing the next generation of cell analysis tools by leveraging novel technical approaches. Our goal is to become the premier cell analysis company through continued innovation that facilitates scientific advances in biomedical research and clinical applications. We believe our core instruments, the Aurora and Northern Lights systems, are the first full spectrum flow cytometers able to deliver high-resolution, high-content and high-sensitivity cell analysis by utilizing the full spectrum of fluorescence signatures from multiple lasers to distinguish fluorescent tags on single cells (“Full Spectrum Profiling” or “FSP”). Our novel approach harnesses the power of information within the entire spectrum of a fluorescent signal to achieve a higher level of multiplexing with exquisite sensitivity. Our patented FSP technology optimizes sensitivity and accuracy through its novel optical and electronic designs that utilize an innovative method of light detection and distribution. Our FSP platform includes instruments, reagents, software and services to provide a comprehensive and integrated suite of solutions for our customers. Since our first U.S. commercial launch in mid-2017 through December 31, 2022, we have sold and deployed over 1,670 instruments— primarily comprised of our Aurora and Northern Lights systems—to customers around the world, including the largest pharmaceutical companies, over 200 biopharma companies, leading academic research centers, and clinical research organizations (“CROs”). In June 2021, we commercially launched the Aurora cell sorter (“Aurora CS”), which leverages our FSP technology to further broaden our potential applications across cell analysis.
 Biological systems are highly complex, and scientists are challenged by the multitude of questions that remain unanswered. Analysis at the single-cell level is essential to understand these complex systems. Identifying the correct cell in the context of a given biological question can have profound implications for drug development and health care decisions. It is essential to correlate information derived from multiple cell analysis approaches and to translate what is known at the gene level to the actual cell function. There is growing demand for deep content through high dimensional cell analysis and for solutions that can provide a complete picture of cellular biological processes and interactions. To achieve this, scientists need to phenotype and isolate rare events or unique populations down to the single-cell through highly resolvable multi-dimensional cell analysis. While flow cytometry is a widely used tool for single-cell analysis, conventional flow cytometry, mass cytometry and early approaches to spectral flow cytometry technologies have historically been challenged due to limited dimensionality, sub-optimal resolution, low throughput, high cost for performance and/or significant technical expertise required to operate systems.
 Our FSP platform addresses the inherent limitations of other technologies by providing a higher density of information with greater sensitivity, more flexibility and increased efficiency, all at a lower cost for performance. Our patented FSP technology is designed to optimize sensitivity and accuracy through its novel optical and electronic designs that utilize an innovative method of light detection and distribution to a specifically selected number and type of detectors. This patented optics design enables researchers to effectively collect the full range of light emissions in an extremely compact space, resulting in higher resolution. Our platform also provides higher content by enabling development of highly complex assays with more than 40 different colors (individual fluorochromes) and thus supporting more than 40 biomarkers, all accessible within just a single tube.
 Our solutions have enabled researchers to make significant scientific advances in key areas of medical discovery (such as oncology, immunology and infectious diseases) in addition to empowering improved downstream cell analysis with complementary cell analysis technologies (such as next-generation sequencing (“NGS”)). We believe that our innovative FSP and targeted cell isolation technology has the potential to accelerate scientific discovery and have a profound impact on the understanding of cell biology, immunotherapy, and targeted therapeutic approaches (personalized medicine). Further, there has been a meaningful acceleration in the rate of publications generated to showcase our technology, with over 1000 peer-reviewed articles published, including many prominent journals, across a wide range of applications including oncology, infectious diseases, immunology, immunotherapy and immuno-oncology.
 Our FSP platform was purpose-built to advance the next generation of cell analysis by delivering deep insights, high-throughputs and ease-of-use. Our FSP platform is designed to offer the following key benefits:
 •Ultra-sensitive: resolve the most challenging cell populations (such as cells with high autofluorescence or low levels of expression of key biomarkers) by providing high-resolution data at the single-cell level with an optimized signal-to-noise ratio.
 •Deep, high integrity content: allow development of highly complex assays through access to more than 40 different colors and thus, supporting more than 40 biomarkers in a single tube without sacrificing precision and throughput to gain a deeper understanding of biological systems and arrive at faster and more accurate diagnoses in clinical settings.


•Flexible and compatible: enable a single configuration across a wide range of reagents and applications, full backwards compatibility across panels, and greater leverage for downstream analysis with complementary technologies, including NGS.
 •Efficient and compact: improve costs and save time while maintaining industry-leading performance and efficient workflows that limit consumables usage and reduce labor costs—all within a highly compact footprint minimizing space requirements for laboratories.
 •Integrated and intuitive: provide fully-integrated workflows through a suite of solutions that include instruments, reagents and kits, software and services. Our proprietary tools and the intuitive functionality of our proprietary SpectroFlo® software coupled with a user-friendly interface allow for enhanced ease-of-use and minimal operator training.
 Our core instruments, the Aurora and Northern Lights systems, are full spectrum flow cytometers founded on our FSP platform technology. The Aurora system—our most advanced and comprehensive offering—is available with three to five lasers and is suitable for customers seeking to access more than 24 colors (with the ability to access more than 40 different colors and support more than 40 biomarkers), while our Northern Lights system—our entry-level offering—is available with one to three lasers and suitable for customers seeking to access a few colors to more than 24 colors. Both instruments are upgradeable based on the desired number of lasers. In June 2021, we commercially launched the Aurora CS, which leverages our FSP technology to rapidly isolate living cell populations from lower-to-higher complexity panels beyond 40 biomarkers. We believe the Aurora CS is the only cell sorter able to accommodate the same number of parameters with the same sensitivity as the Aurora cell analyzer system. Each system is supported by our highly intuitive, proprietary embedded SpectroFlo® software, our reagents, and our service offerings to provide a comprehensive, end-to-end platform of solutions for our customers.
 Within the life sciences technology market, flow cytometry technologies currently provide solutions largely within cell proliferation, cell counting, cell identification, cell quality control and single-cell applications, representing an initial total addressable market of nearly $12 billion. However, we believe that, driven by enhanced capabilities, our FSP platform has the potential to capture an increasingly greater share of the broader cell analysis market, which according to industry sources is expected to grow from roughly $17 billion in 2022 to approximately $28 billion by 2027. Further, we believe our differentiated platform will enable us to expand the use of cell analysis into new markets, well beyond current applications addressed by prior flow cytometry technologies and other cell analysis technologies. Thus, we believe our potential total addressable market is larger than the current cell analysis market, which excludes new and existing markets addressable by our platform, such as clinical research applications within immunotherapy, immuno-oncology, bio-processing, infectious diseases, and immuno-deficiencies. In addition, the combination of our platform with complementary, downstream cell analysis technologies is expected to provide additional areas for new clinical research applications—for example, combining FSP technology with NGS has demonstrated an improved ability to predict leukemia relapse after therapy (such as minimal residual disease (“MRD”) testing) and served to support the use of our technology within personalized medicine. As our FSP platform is further validated through the continued acceleration of peer-reviewed publications in new applications, we expect our total addressable market to expand.
 We believe the combination of our people and our global reach across the United States, Europe and Asia will enable us to continue to execute on our growth strategies, stay ahead of competition and remain at the forefront of innovation in cell analysis. Our leadership team has extensive track records in the life sciences and technology sectors. Our multidisciplinary group of over 580 employees includes employees with expertise across optics, electronics, fluidics, computer sciences, chemistry, biology, and medical sciences. Our worldwide commercial team of more than 130 employees and our research and development team of more than 160 employees have significant expertise, industry experience and collaborative relationships with key opinion leaders (“KOLs”), industry leaders, innovators and potential customers.
 We have a long history of providing high-quality and efficient customer service and our product development efforts reflect our deep understanding of our customers’ needs. One of our key differentiators is our customer-facing technical team, which collaborates closely with our customers to identify and find solutions for unmet needs across the market. We collaborate closely with KOLs, generating relevant data and publications to demonstrate not only the feasibility, but also the quality of our FSP approach. We plan to continue executing on our strategy to accelerate our growth by driving adoption of our FSP solutions, inspiring innovation, investing in integrated workflow solutions, and driving application development and adoption in clinical markets.
 We believe our financial results reflect the significant market demand for our offerings and adoption of our FSP technology: our strong financial profile is differentiated by the combination of our scaled revenue base, high revenue growth and profitability. Our revenue for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $164.0 million, $128.0 million, and $92.8 million, respectively. We generated net income of $2.5 million $3.0 million, and $19.4 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

We can provide insights to clinicians to facilitate personalized medicine for patients, as well as facilitate biopharma’s research and development efforts to develop the next-generation of targeted therapies. Our Northern Lights CLC system has been registered or approved for clinical use in the European Union and China and we plan to continue generating supporting publications and data, as well as pursue any required regulatory approvals for clinical use in the United States.
Our Market Opportunity and Industry Background
 Our market opportunity. Within the life sciences technology market, flow cytometry technologies currently provide solutions, including cell proliferation, cell counting, cell identification, cell quality control and single- cell applications, largely within the global cell analysis market. However, we believe that the enhanced capabilities of our FSP platform relative to conventional flow cytometry (“CFCs”), mass cytometry and early approaches to spectral flow cytometry enable us to capture an increasingly greater share of the total addressable market by accessing the entire cell analysis market, which according to industry sources is expected to grow from roughly $17 billion in 2022 to approximately $28 billion by 2027. Further, we believe our differentiated platform will enable us to expand the use of cell analysis into new markets, well beyond current applications addressed by prior flow cytometry technologies and other cell analysis technologies. Thus, we believe our potential total addressable market is larger than the current cell analysis market, which excludes new and existing markets addressable by our platform, such as clinical research applications within immunotherapy, immuno-oncology, bio-processing, infectious diseases and immuno-deficiencies. In addition, the combination of our platform with complementary, downstream cell analysis technologies is expected to provide additional areas for new applications—for example, combining FSP technology with NGS has demonstrated an improved ability to predict leukemia relapse after therapy (such as MRD testing) and served to support the use of our technology within personalized medicine. As our FSP platform is further validated through the continued acceleration of peer-reviewed publications in new applications, we expect our total addressable market to expand.
 Complementary technologies to FSP and multi-omics applications. Since our FSP platform provides highly complex data down to single-cell resolution at a rapid speed, it is inherently well-suited to drive more targeted and efficient downstream analyses for other single-cell technologies, such as NGS, single-cell capture and sample preparation, high-resolution microscopy (such as mass imaging cytometry, super resolution microscopy, confocal microscopy and high-throughput screening platforms), and micro and optofluidic

systems. FSP is highly complementary to single-cell genomics applications utilizing NGS as it can be used earlier in workflows to rapidly phenotype and isolate living cell populations to the single-cell level with highly multiplexed proteomic data. These cells can then be transferred from our instrument into NGS systems to correlate proteomic and genomic expression, which in turn enables researchers to develop novel drug targets for therapeutics and clinicians to drive outcomes for patients through more informed treatment decision-making. For example, a peer-reviewed article published in the Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation journal recognized that combining multiparameter flow cytometry with NGS resulted in an improved ability to predict leukemia relapse after therapy, demonstrating strong potential utility in the large and growing market for MRD testing. With MRD, end users require high sensitivity and standardization, which makes our FSP technology ideal in addressing these challenges. According to a global MRD testing market report by BIS Research in December 2020, flow cytometry technology has the largest market share in MRD testing among relevant technologies, including NGS, polymerase chain reaction and others.
 Importance of cell analysis at the single-cell level. Due to the heterogeneity within tissues, understanding cellular biology, particularly at the single-cell level, is necessary to unravel mechanisms that might otherwise not be detectable in bulk assays. Deep cellular analysis is a key application that we expect to enable a new age of healthcare delivery, and in particular, personalized medicine. The global healthcare market requires advanced cell analysis technologies to research therapeutic and diagnostic solutions to address emerging and chronic infectious diseases, an aging population with a myriad of chronic diseases, and the need for more effective and targeted therapeutics. These primary market forces, among others, will drive the direction for cell analysis applications that provide new possibilities for novel drug development and improved patient outcomes through enhanced disease detection, diagnosis, and treatment monitoring.
 OUR PRODUCTS
 We are a leading cell analysis solutions provider that develops compact, cost-effective full spectrum profiling instruments with high multiplexing capability, and we offer a wide range of services to support scientists and clinicians. Our products are used in the world’s most renowned pharmaceutical and clinical research organizations, as well as premier academic and research institutions.
Aurora and Northern Lights Systems
 Our Aurora and Northern Lights systems were commercially launched in June 2017 and October 2018, respectively. Both instruments are highly flexible, intuitive, and ultra-sensitive full spectrum flow cytometers, utilizing state-of-the-art optics and low-noise electronics to provide excellent sensitivity and resolution, allowing researchers to resolve rare cell populations that were previously challenging to resolve. The optics and electronics designs, combined with flat-top beam profiles and a unique vacuum fluidics system, translate to outstanding performance from low to high sample flow rate, analyzing up to 35,000 events per second with certain configurations. Additionally, our optical design and unmixing algorithm make the instrument amenable to a wide array of applications and fluorochrome options, all without needing to reconfigure the instrument hardware as would otherwise be required on a CFC.
 The Aurora system is available with three to five lasers and can detect more than 40 biomarkers in one sample tube. The Northern Lights system is available with one to three lasers and can detect more than 24 biomarkers in one sample tube. Both instruments are upgradeable based on the desired number of lasers, which drives greater or less access to biomarkers. In addition, both instruments incorporate our SpectroFlo® software, which offers an intuitive workflow from quality control to sample acquisition to data analysis, with technology- enabling tools that simplify running applications.
 Our Aurora and Northern Lights systems are used in the study of infectious diseases, immunology, immunotherapy, immuno-oncology, oncology, inflammation, and drug discovery.
 The Northern Lights CLC system was certified under the European Union In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive ("IVDD") in September 2020 and is registered as an in vitro diagnostic medical device under Northern Lights Clinical Flow Cytometer. The certification enables the Northern Lights CLC system to be sold into in vitro diagnostic laboratories in the European Union and in other countries around the world that accept this specific certification. The Northern Lights CLC system is also certified for in vitro diagnostic use as a Class II device in China.
 Aurora CS System
 Key to the discovery of unraveling cellular complexity is the ability to perform additional downstream genomic and proteomic studies on the specific subsets identified using high dimensional phenotyping approaches. Our Aurora CS was commercially launched in June 2021 and is the first highly flexible, intuitive and ultra-sensitive cell sorter that leverages the detection and sensitivity capabilities of our FSP technology to isolate living cell populations from lower to higher complexity panels beyond 40 biomarkers. Our FSP technology enables the processing of a tremendous amount of highly complex information to provide real- time unmixing and sorting capabilities at the field-programmable gate array level. The implications are significant in terms of flexibility and user experience, including experiment workflow transportability and assay reproducibility, enabling a 40-biomarker assay to be run in both the Aurora and the Aurora CS systems, with similar results. With our technology, users can first identify cell populations and then isolate the live cells for downstream studies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, proteomics, and cell biology. We believe this new technology will enable users to gain a deeper level of cell classification, take advantage of key trends and scientific expansion, and allow for greater clinical research applications, such as with MRD, cell analysis and disease discovery.


Unlike other high-capacity sorters, we believe the Aurora CS is the only cell sorter that can accommodate the same number of parameters with the same sensitivity as the Aurora system and isolate living cell populations of interest using the same panel and without having to alter the optical configuration, while also being able to sort panels designed for conventional analyzers.
 Reagents and Kits
 We also have launched our reagent products to provide additional options for researchers and clinical laboratories when choosing which biomarkers to run together in a panel, particularly since our Aurora, Northern Lights and Aurora CS systems allow for more fluorochromes to be run together than was previously commercially available. Our technology was able to inform our fluorochrome development through the identification of areas within the spectrum for which there were currently no available fluorochrome options. Our cFluor® reagents are fluorochrome conjugated antibodies used to identify cells of interest for analysis on our instruments. We offer and continue to develop cFluor® immunoprofiling kits, which include the cFluor reagents and tools necessary to simplify the workflow from sample preparation to data analysis.
We launched our 14-color immunoprofiling kit in December 2020, which is designed to distinguish different subsets of T, B and natural killer (“TBNK”) cells, and our 25-color immunoprofiling assay in October 2021 to provide a turnkey solution for identifying major human immune subpopulations for TBNK cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, and basophils – all of which play important roles in the innate and adaptive immune response in various diseases. We released a 13-color human B cell monitoring kit in December 2022 to provide a turnkey solution for identifying and enumerating B cell subsets in human whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and in January 2023, we introduced the single-tube 20-color panel for identifying and characterizing normal and aberrant cells and evaluating MRD in acute myeloid leukemia samples. Most recently, in February 2022, we released our pan leukocyte kit, a lyse-no-wash assay designed to help researchers fully enumerate the complete set of major leukocyte subsets in drug discovery and development. These research use only (“RUO”) products are optimized for use with our Aurora and Northern Lights systems and designed to simplify the workflow and improve operational efficiency for our customers.
 Our single-color reagents are registered as Class 1 with the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) and in the European Union under the IVDD. We are seeking Class 3 registration with the NMPA of our 6-color reagent cocktails that identify and determine the percentages and absolute counts of TBNK cells in peripheral blood. We expect these recent and planned reagent and application solutions to be a significant driver of our future reagent revenue and pull-through as our installed base of instruments grows.
 To help accelerate our overarching goal to become a comprehensive solutions provider to our customers, we acquired the reagents business of Tonbo Biotechnologies Corporation in November 2021.
 Automated Micro-Sampling System and Automated Sample Loader System
Our Automated Micro-Sampling (“AMS”) system and Automated Sample Loader (“ASL”) system were commercially launched in 2018 and 2021, respectively. The AMS and ASL systems are automated loaders designed to integrate seamlessly into the Aurora and Northern Lights systems, increasing sample throughput and adding automation capabilities to our FSP systems. The systems offer preset settings for ease of use, but also allow researchers to customize and fine-tune the systems for their unique experimental requirements. Their reliable 96-well plate acquisition solution increases productivity. The ASL adds additional compatibility with 96 deep-well plates 40-tube racks. Both systems have three throughput modes (high-throughput, default, low carryover) to meet changing customer priorities.
 SpectroFlo® Software
 Our proprietary SpectroFlo software is integrated into our systems and is unique in that it offers intuitive workflows for handling full spectrum flow cytometry data, from quality control to data analysis. The software was developed specifically for our Aurora and Northern Lights systems to streamline instrument setup, automated quality control, data analysis and experiment exports. With the ability to import a previously designed experiment template, users are able to quickly set up their experiments and there is no need to re-enter the panel design, acquisition criteria, reagent information or data analysis worksheets. With our SpectroFlo software, users can conveniently and efficiently collect both raw and unmixed FCS 3.1 files, which can be used to live unmix samples and extract autofluorescence that would otherwise negative impact data resolution.
 Customer Support Tools
 We strive to continually innovate by developing new quantitative tools, which are integrated into our software or available to our customers on our website, to enable users to independently create high- color panels for use with our systems, to support efficient workflow solutions and to provide an intuitive user experience. As fluorochrome (color) selection is a key component of assay development and optimization, our full spectrum viewer is a unique tool capable of displaying the full emission spectrum of a fluorochrome (emission at different wavelengths post-excitation with multiple lasers). Our FSP technology provides an in-depth understanding of the fluorescence emission characteristics of nearly every color available in the market and our full spectrum viewer provides users with comprehensive information regarding emission characteristics of the fluorochromes to optimize fluorochrome selection for assay development. As a complementary tool to our full spectrum viewer, we have developed the Similarity and the Complexity indices, which provide unique metrics for assessing fluorochrome compatibility within a panel. The Similarity index compares the emission spectrum of two dyes, identifying whether the dyes have unique characteristics or if the dyes are identical, which

determines whether they can be used together to analyze a sample in a flow cytometry assay. The Complexity index is a metric that predicts how well a panel of colors will work in combination to minimize loss of resolution and sensitivity. Additionally, we recently launched Cytek Cloud, a digital ecosystem that supports full spectrum flow cytometry research from panel design to data acquisition, seamlessly integrating with our SpectroFlo software. Cytek Cloud features two integrated online tools, Panel Builder and Experiment Builder, to streamline experiment workflow on our Aurora, Northern Lights and Aurora CS systems. Panel Builder enables users to quickly visualize, compare, and optimize their fluorochrome selections with multiple spectral panel design tools, allowing them to build their panels in a simple and organized interface. Experiment Builder allows users to set up their experiments in advance to make efficient use of their time on the instrument.
 DxP Athena
 Our DxP Athena conventional flow cytometry system commercially launched in 2016 and is currently available for sale only in China. It is certified for clinical use by China NMPA. The DxP Athena system incorporates DxP technology with efficient PMTs to enable high sensitivity and high resolution and our proprietary QbSure software to ensure optimal daily instrument performance. The system is available in multiple configurations with one to three lasers and up to 13 fluorescence detection channels. The automated monthly clean bleach cycle minimizes downtime, streamlines maintenance and encourages compliance.
 SALES AND MARKETING
 We distribute our products through our direct sales force and support organizations located in North America, Europe, China and several countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and through distributors or sales agents in several countries in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. Our sales and marketing efforts are targeted at academic and governmental institutions, CROs, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and clinical laboratories focused on single-cell analysis.
 Our sales process often involves interactions and demonstrations with multiple people within an organization. Some potential customers conduct in-depth evaluations of the system, including running experiments on our system and competing systems. In addition, in many countries outside of North America, sales to academic or governmental institutions require participation in a tender process involving preparation of extensive documentation and a lengthy review process. As a result of these factors and the budget cycles of our customers, the sales cycle on our instrument, the time from initial contact with a customer to our receipt of a purchase order, can be six months or longer.
 MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY
 Our manufacturing operations are located in Fremont and San Diego, California and Wuxi, China. We commenced manufacturing operations in Fremont, California in 2015. Our Fremont facility maintains ISO 9001 certification and manufactures our Aurora and Aurora CS systems, as well as our reagents and spare parts. Our Wuxi manufacturing facility commenced operations in 2017 and maintains ISO 9001 and ISO 13485 certification. Our Wuxi facility manufactures our Northern Lights and Athena instruments, reagents and spare parts and delivers certain instruments to our Fremont facilities for final assembly and testing. Our instruments and reagents for clinical use are currently manufactured only in our Wuxi facility.
 We established the manufacturing facility in Wuxi, China to take advantage of the skilled workforce, supplier and partner network, lower operating costs and available government support. We are able to hire skilled employees from China’s existing in vitro diagnostic and optical product industry. China also has a broad network of potential suppliers and partners for our manufacturing operations and we are able to locally source a large portion of the raw materials required for our manufacturing processes. We have received incentive grants from the local Wuxi government for research, development, and manufacturing.
 We believe that having dual sources for our core products would help mitigate the potential impact of a production disruption at any one of our facilities to ensure a reliable and stable supply chain and product availability for our customers. We relocated our Fremont headquarters and manufacturing facility in October 2021 to provide us with capacity expansion capability that would be sufficient to support our growth. We expect that our existing manufacturing capacity for instrumentation and reagents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for at least the next several years.
 We rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain components and materials used in our systems. Key components in our products that are supplied by sole or limited source suppliers include certain lasers, semiconductors and mechanical components that are used in our optical, electrical and fluidic subassemblies. While we are in the process of qualifying additional sources of supply, qualifications can take 12 to 24 months and, in some cases, longer. If we were to lose one or more of our sole or limited source suppliers, it would take significant time and effort to qualify alternative suppliers. With respect to many of our suppliers, we are neither a major customer, nor do we have long term supply contracts. These suppliers may therefore give other customers’ needs higher priority than ours, and we may not be able to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms.
 COMPETITION
 We face significant competition from within the cell analysis and life sciences tools market. We currently compete with established and early stage life sciences and in vitro diagnostics (“IVD”) companies developing or commercializing flow cytometry instruments and consumables, as well as other companies that design, manufacture and market instruments, consumables, reagent kits and software

for, among other applications, cell analysis, immunophenotyping, cell sorting and/or provide services related to the same. Our direct competitors include Agilent Technologies, Beckman Coulter (Danaher Corporation), Becton, Dickinson and Company, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Standard BioTools, Miltenyi Biotec, Sony Biotechnology (Sony Corporation) and Thermo Fisher Scientific. Our target customers may also elect to develop their workflows on CFCs, or using traditional methods, rather than implementing our platform or existing customers may decide to stop using our platform. In addition, there are many large, established companies in the life sciences tools market that we do not currently compete with but that could develop instruments, tools or other products that will compete with us in the future. These companies have substantially greater financial and other resources than us, including larger research and development, quality and regulatory staff or more established marketing and sales forces.
 For further discussion of the risks we face relating to competition, see the section titled “Risk factors— Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy—The market for cell analysis technologies and life sciences tools, including flow cytometry, is highly competitive, and if we cannot compete successfully with our competitors, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue, or achieve and sustain profitability.”
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our commercially important technology, inventions and know-how; to defend and enforce our parents; to operate without infringing, misappropriating or violating our proprietary rights. We have developed our own portfolio of issued patents and patent applications directed at our core and system level technology, including claims directed to methods and apparatus of flow cytometers and cell sorters with excitation, fluidics, emission, mechanical, magnetic, electronics, bio-safety and temperature control technology in configurations of our Aurora, Aurora CS, Northern Lights and Northern Lights CLC systems. We generally seek patent protection in the United States, Japan, China and selected countries of the European Union, such as France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Notwithstanding these efforts, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we have filed or may license or file in the future, and we cannot be sure that any patents we own or license or patents that may be licensed or granted to us in the future will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that such patents will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 As of December 31, 2022, we own 12 issued U.S. utility patents, two issued Japan utility patents, one issued European utility patent and one issued China utility patent. We have 42 pending utility patent applications, including 25 utility patent applications in the United States, five utility patent applications in the European Union, five utility patent applications in China and three utility patent applications in Japan. Assuming all maintenance fees are paid, the U.S. issued patents are expected to naturally expire between years 2023 and 2038. Patents covering intellectual property relating to design specific technologies invented by our researchers in Shanghai and Wuxi, China are filed in China and owned by our China subsidiaries, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, our Shanghai subsidiary owns 15 issued utility patents and one issued invention patent and has ten pending invention patent applications and one pending utility patent application, and our Wuxi subsidiary owns 36 issued patents and has eight pending patent applications, including nine pending utility patent applications and seven pending invention patent applications.
 To our knowledge, there are no third party claims or contested proceedings with the issued patents or pending patent applications other than the ordinary course proceedings with pending patent applications before the respective patent offices. However, the patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our patents may not enable us to obtain or keep any competitive advantage. Our pending U.S. and foreign patent applications may not issue as patents or may not issue in a form that will be advantageous to us. Any patents we have obtained or do obtain may be challenged by re-examination, opposition or other administrative proceeding, or may be challenged in litigation, and such challenges could result in a determination that the patent is invalid. In addition, competitors may be able to design alternative methods or devices that avoid infringement of our patents. Furthermore, numerous U.S. and foreign-issued patents and patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which our products compete. Because patent applications can take many years to publish, there may be applications unknown to us, which may result in issued patents that our existing or future products or technologies may be alleged to infringe. To the extent our intellectual property protection offers inadequate protection, or is found to be invalid, we are exposed to a greater risk of direct competition. If our intellectual property does not provide adequate protection against our competitors’ products, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business. Both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.
 In addition to pursuing patents on our technology, we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, corporate partners and, when needed, our advisors. Such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements, and we may not be able to prevent such unauthorized disclosure. Monitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate.


Our commercial success may depend in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties have asserted and may assert in the future that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. Competitors may assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into those markets and there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. In addition, our competitors and others may have patents or may in the future obtain patents and claim that use of our products infringes these patents. We could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending any of these claims. Parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief, which could block our ability to develop, commercialize and sell products, and could result in the award of substantial damages against us. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay damages, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, or be prohibited from selling certain products. We may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, if at all.
 KEY AGREEMENTS, LICENSES AND COLLABORATIONS
 Biotium, Inc. Supply and License Agreement
 On September 1, 2020, we entered into a Supply and License Agreement with Biotium, Inc. (“Biotium”) pursuant to which Biotium agreed to supply, and we obtained a worldwide, non-exclusive license to market and resell to our customers and distributors, certain Biotium products to conjugate proteins and/or antibodies and to use such conjugates as a component in our cFluor reagent products, for research and analyte specific reagents (as defined by 21 CFR 864.4020) use only (the “Field of Use”) (the “Biotium Agreement”). In consideration for such rights, we paid Biotium an upfront fee of $20,000 and will pay Biotium royalties at a mid-to-high single digit percentage rate on worldwide net sales on licensed products within the Field of Use. The Biotium Agreement terminates on the expiration of the last to expire of the valid claims of the Biotium patents subject to the Biotium Agreement. Either party may terminate the Biotium Agreement for the other party’s bankruptcy or uncured material breach or if no Biotium product is purchased for an extended period; however, if such termination is by Biotium, we will have the opportunity to make a purchase following written notice from Biotium to avoid such termination. Our license under the Biotium Agreement does not include diagnostic use, which may be added through an amendment and additional payment to Biotium.
Becton, Dickinson and Company Settlement, License and Equity Issuance Agreement

The Coherent Agreement may be terminated prior to the end of its term upon the occurrence of certain specified events.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
 We are focused on developing innovative products to meet unmet market needs and maintaining a diverse and inclusive work environment where employees are respected and encouraged to share their unique perspectives and ideas. As of December 31, 2022, we had 583 employees, including 162 employees in research and development, 134 employees in sales and marketing, 223 employees in manufacturing and operations, and 64 employees in general and administrative. We believe that the success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Our employees are neither represented by a labor union nor party to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that we have strong employee relations.
Culture and Values
 We seek to maintain high ethical standards and a culture that values honesty, integrity, accountability and transparency in all that we do. We are committed to our employees and to the communities we serve worldwide. It is our philosophy to foster open communication and our employees are encouraged to provide input on ways to improve our business strategy and tactics, work

environment and organization. We believe that our ability to provide employees with a dynamic environment and professional growth opportunities drives a culture embedded in our values.
 Business Ethics
 We are committed to conducting our business activities with employees, consultants, vendors, customers, communities and stockholders with integrity and fairness and in accordance with the highest ethical standards. We believe that our conduct has a direct impact on our reputation, our brand and our stakeholders. We are focused on ensuring that our legal, compliance and risk mitigation protocols further enhance our ability to comport ourselves with the highest levels of ethical standards.
Talent Attraction, Retention and Engagement
 By focusing on individual performance, as well as teamwork and collaboration, we believe that we foster an environment that helps employees excel as individuals and as team members. To further engage and incentivize our workforce, we offer programs and avenues for support, motivation and professional development. For example, we utilize both instructor-led training and online learning to deliver proprietary, targeted training courses designed to position our commercial organization as the leading cell analysis solutions provider. For our talent pipeline development, we work closely with individual business functions to provide training and hands-on support for managers and leaders.
Compensation Philosophy
 We strive to provide comprehensive compensation, including cash, equity, benefits and services that attract, motivate and retain exceptional employees. Compensation is driven by local market conditions, internal equity and employee performance.
Health and Wellness
 We offer a comprehensive package including: 401(k) plan with a company-match component, medical, dental and vision insurance, life insurance, short-and long-term disability insurance, 18 paid vacation days per year or flexible time off (depending on employee level), paid days for illness and family emergencies, and health savings and flexible spending accounts.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRODUCT APPROVAL
 Our Northern Lights CLC system has been approved for clinical use in the European Union and China and we plan to continue generating supporting publications and data, as well as pursue any required regulatory approvals for clinical use in the United States. In the United States, our products are currently labeled and promoted, and are, and in the near-future are expected to continue to be, sold primarily to academic and research institutions and biopharmaceutical companies as RUO products, and are not currently designed, or intended to be used, for clinical diagnostic tests. However, as we continue to expand our product lines and the applications and uses of our existing products into new fields, certain of our current or future products could become subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) or comparable international agencies, including requirements for regulatory clearance, authorization or approval of such products before they can be marketed. Also, even if our products are labeled, promoted and intended as RUO, the FDA or comparable international agencies could disagree with our conclusion that our products are intended for research use only or deem our sales, marketing and promotional efforts as being inconsistent with RUO products. For example, our customers may independently elect to use our RUO labeled products in their own laboratory-developed tests (“LDT”) for clinical diagnostic use, which could subject our products to government regulation, even if clinical uses of our RUO products by our customers were done without our consent.
 FDA Regulation of Medical Devices
The FDA and other U.S. and foreign governmental agencies regulate, among other things, with respect to medical devices:
•design, development and manufacturing; 
 •testing, labeling, content and language of instructions for use and storage; 
 •clinical trials; 
 •product safety; 
 •marketing, sales and distribution; 
 •pre-market clearance and approval; 
 •record keeping procedures; 
 •advertising and promotion; 
 •recalls and field safety corrective actions; 


•post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury; 
 •post-market approval studies; and 
 •product import and export. 
In the United States, numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices are brought to market and marketed. These include the FDCA and the FDA’s implementing regulations, among others. 
FDA Pre-market Clearance and Approval Requirements
Each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States must first receive 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or approval of a pre-market approval (PMA) application, from the FDA, unless specifically exempted. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be resource intensive, expensive and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available. 
The FDA classifies all medical devices into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation(“QSR”), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and additional conditions set forth in FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) pre-market notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) pre-market notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA application. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to the FDA’s pre-market notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed.
 Our products are expected to be classified as Class II devices.
 510(k) Clearance Process
 To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre-market notification to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously-cleared 510(k) device, a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of PMA applications, or is a device that has been reclassified from Class III to either Class II or I. In rare cases, Class III devices may be cleared through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months from the date the application is submitted and filed with the FDA, but may take significantly longer, particularly for a novel type of product. Although many 510(k) pre-market notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a pre-market notification submission, the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process.
 If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo classification process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. Once a de novo application is reviewed and approved, it results in the device having a Class II status and future devices from the company or a competitor may use the company’s de novo-classified device as a 510(k) predicate.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any subsequent modification of the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA may review any such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA is obtained. Under these circumstances, the FDA may also subject a manufacturer to significant regulatory fines or other penalties.
 Legislative or regulatory reforms in the United States or the EU may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our products or to manufacture, market or distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained.


De Novo Classification Process
 Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II, or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.
Pre-Market Approval Process
 A PMA application must be submitted if the medical device is in Class III (although the FDA has the discretion to continue to allow certain pre- amendment Class III devices to use the 510(k) process) or cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. A PMA application must be supported by, among other things, extensive technical, preclinical, and clinical trials, as well as manufacturing and labeling data to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device.
Research Use Only
 Our products and operations may be subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, or local authorities, as well as foreign regulatory authorities. Certain of our products are currently marketed as RUO. An RUO product is one that is not intended for clinical diagnostic use and must be labeled “For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.” RUO products cannot make any claims related to safety, effectiveness or diagnostic utility and they cannot be intended for human clinical diagnostic use. Products that are intended for research use only and are properly labeled as RUO are exempt from compliance with the FDA requirements discussed above, including the approval or clearance and most QSR requirements. A product labeled RUO but intended to be used diagnostically may be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and misbranded under the FDC Act and is subject to FDA enforcement activities. The FDA may consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding distribution and use of an RUO product, including how the product is marketed, when determining its intended use. In November 2013 the FDA issued a guidance document entitled “Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only” (RUO Guidance) which highlights the FDA’s interpretation that distribution of RUO products with any labeling, advertising or promotion that suggests that clinical laboratories can validate the test through their own procedures and subsequently offer it for clinical diagnostic use as a laboratory developed test is in conflict with RUO status. The RUO Guidance further articulates the FDA’s position that any assistance offered in performing clinical validation or verification, or similar specialized technical support, to clinical laboratories, conflicts with RUO status. If the FDA were to determine, based on the totality of circumstances, that our products labeled and marketed for RUO are intended for diagnostic purposes, they would be considered medical products that will require clearance or approval prior to commercialization.
Laboratory-developed tests (LDTs)
 LDTs have generally been considered to be tests that are designed, developed, validated and used within a single laboratory. The FDA takes the position that it has the authority to regulate such tests as medical devices under the FDC Act. The FDA has historically exercised enforcement discretion and has not required clearance or approval of LDTs prior to marketing.
 On October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents regarding oversight of LDTs. These draft guidance documents proposed more active review of LDTs. The draft guidance documents have been the subject of considerable controversy, and in November 2016, the FDA announced that it would not be finalizing the 2014 draft guidance documents. On January 13, 2017, the FDA issued a discussion paper which laid out elements of a possible revised future LDT regulatory framework, but did not establish any regulatory requirements.
 The FDA’s efforts to regulate LDTs have prompted the drafting of legislation governing diagnostic products and services that sought to substantially revamp the regulation of both LDTs and IVDs. Congress may act to provide further direction to the FDA on the regulation of LDTs.
Pervasive and Continuing U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation
 After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous FDA regulatory requirements apply, including, but not limited to the following:
•the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; 


•establishment registration, which requires establishments involved in the production and distribution of medical devices, intended for commercial distribution in the United States, to register with the FDA; 
 •medical device listing, which requires manufacturers to list the devices they have in commercial distribution with the FDA; 
 •clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices; 
 •medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur; 
 •correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; 
 •complying with the new federal law and regulations requiring Unique Device Identifiers (UDI) on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database; 
 •the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; 
 •labeling regulations, which prohibit “misbranded” devices from entering the market, as well as prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and 
 •post-market surveillance including Medical Device Reporting, which requires manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.
 The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include one or more of the following sanctions:
•untitled letters or warning letters; 
 •customer notifications for repair, replacement or refunds; 
 •fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
 •mandatory recall or seizure of our products; 
 •administrative detention or banning of our products; 
 •operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
 •refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or PMA of new product versions; 
 •revocation of 510(k) clearance or PMAs previously granted; and 
 •criminal prosecution and penalties.
 Foreign Government Regulation
 The regulatory review process for medical devices varies from country to country, and many countries also impose product standards, packaging requirements, environmental requirements, labeling requirements and import restrictions on devices. Each country has its own tariff regulations, duties, and tax requirements. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements may subject a company to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, criminal prosecution or other consequences.
European Union
 The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation.
 The Medical Devices Regulation will among other things:
•strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available; 
 •establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market; 
 •improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end user or patient through a unique identification number; 
 •set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and 
 •strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
 To the extent that our products have already been certified under the existing regulatory framework, the MDR allows us to market them provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. In particular, the certificate in question must still be valid. Under article 120(2) MDR, certificates issued by notified bodies before May 25, 2017 will remain valid until their indicated expiry dates. By contrast, certificates issued after May 25, 2017 will be void at the latest by May 27, 2024. Accordingly, before that date, we will need to obtain new CE Certificates of Conformity. Furthermore, the regulation introduces UDI, a bar code that must be placed on the label of the device or on its packaging and manufacturers will be obligated to file adverse effects reports via the Eudamed platform in case there is an increase in the frequency or severity of incidents related to the medical device.
 Other Healthcare Laws
 Our current and future business activities are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims and physician sunshine laws and regulations.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.
 Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the U.S. government. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government intervenes and is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter, or if the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government’s involvement, then the plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of life sciences companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will

continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
 HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.
 The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our future operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment.
 U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from directly or indirectly offering, promising, authorizing or making corrupt payments, gifts or transfers to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business. The scope of the FCPA would include interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
 Our research and development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including flammables, toxics, corrosives and biologics. Our research operations produce hazardous biological and chemical waste products. We seek to comply with applicable laws regarding the handling and disposal of such materials. Given the small volume of such materials used or generated at our facilities, we do not expect our compliance efforts to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position. However, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. We do not currently maintain separate environmental liability coverage and any such contamination or discharge could result in significant cost to us in penalties, damages and suspension of our operations.
