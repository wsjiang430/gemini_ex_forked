Our Company
We are a rapidly-growing specialty distributor and select manufacturer of disposable foodservice products and related items. We are a nimble supplier of a wide range of products for the foodservice industry, including food and take-out containers, bags, tableware, cups, lids, cutlery, straws, specialty beverage ingredients, equipment, gloves and other products. Our products are available in plastic, paper, biopolymer-based and other compostable forms. Our Karat Earth® line provides environmentally friendly options to our customers, who are increasingly focused on sustainability. We also offer customized solutions to our customers, including new product development, design, printing and logistics services.
While a majority of our revenue is generated from the distribution of our vendors’ products, we have select manufacturing capabilities in the U.S., which allows us to provide customers with broad product choices and customized offerings with short lead times. For the year ended December 31, 2022, distribution accounted for approximately 74% of our net sales, while manufacturing accounted for approximately 26% of our net sales. We expect manufacturing to remain a relatively small portion of our sales mix in fiscal year 2023, but believe it provides us with the flexibility to provide customized products with short lead times to complement our global sourcing capabilities. To that end, we operate our business strategically and with broad flexibility to provide both our large and small customers with the wide spectrum of products they need to successfully run and grow their businesses. We believe our ability to source products quickly on a cost-effective basis via a global supplier network, complemented by our own manufacturing capabilities for select products, has established us as a differentiated provider of high-quality products relative to our competitors.
Our customers include a wide variety of national and regional distributors, restaurant chains, retail establishments and online customers. Our products are well suited to address our customers’ increased focus on take-out and delivery capabilities. Our diverse and growing blue chip customer base includes well-known fast casual chains such as Applebee’s Neighborhood Grill + Bar, Chili’s Grill & Bar, PF Chang's, Texas Roadhouse, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Corner Bakery Cafe and TGI Fridays, as well as fast food chains including The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, El Pollo Loco, In-N-Out Burger, Jack in The Box, Popeyes, Panda Express, Raising Cane’s Chicken Fingers and Torchy’s Tacos. As our capabilities, product offering and footprint expand, we are also beginning to supply products to national and regional supermarket chains, airlines, sports and entertainment venues and other non-restaurant customers. Our strong brand recognition in the foodservice industry, nimble operations and rapidly increasing size and scope of our distribution and logistics network provide us with a significant advantage that enables us to acquire new customers as well as increase our business with existing customers. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, no single customer represented more than 10% of our revenue. 
We are an omni-channel provider and have recently made significant investments in e-commerce, technology, supply chain, distribution center layout remodels, and customer initiatives, such as online ordering and same day pickup. We operate our e-commerce channel through our company website, www.lollicupstore.com, and also through third-party storefronts such as Amazon and Walmart. Our e-commerce channel offers the entire range of our products for online procurement, and we believe it will continue to be a key growth driver for our business going forward. Additionally, the e-commerce channel enables us to cross market other products to our customers.
We classify our customers into four categories: distributors, national and regional chains, retail and online.
•    Distributors: national and regional distributors across the U.S. that purchase our products and provide a channel to offer our products to restaurants, offices, schools, government entities and other end users.
•    National and regional chains: typically fast casual and fast food restaurants with locations across multiple states to which we supply specified products. We enter into sales contracts with a subset of our national and regional chains customers, providing visibility into future revenue.
•    Retail: primarily regional bubble tea shops, boutique coffee shops and frozen yogurt shops that often purchase our specialty beverage ingredients and related items.
•    Online: small businesses, often with less than two locations, such as small restaurants, bubble tea shops, coffee shops, juice bars, smoothie shops and some customers who purchase for personal use.
In addition to product sales, we also generate revenue from logistics services which is the transportation and delivery of shipping containers from ports to customers, primarily to retail customers. The diversity of our customer types provides us with the ability to source products efficiently while maintaining a broad product offering, as we are able to sell many products 
across multiple customer segments. We expect a large proportion of our growth to come from national and regional chains and our higher margin online customers.
We have generated significant growth through the continued expansion of our customer base and increasing penetration into existing customers across all channels. In addition, we have been able to grow our wallet share with many customers, in particular our national and regional chains, by supplying them a broader range of our foodservice disposables and related products. We believe that the current industry environment and regulatory landscape has accelerated the shift in consumer preferences towards food delivery, take-out ordering and eco-friendly sustainable products, which we expect to continue in the foreseeable future.
We currently operate manufacturing facilities and distribution and fulfillment centers in Chino, California, Rockwall, Texas and Kapolei, Hawaii. In addition, we operate other distribution centers located in Rockwall, Texas, Branchburg, New Jersey, Sumner, Washington, Summerville, South Carolina, Kapolei, Hawaii and City of Industry, California. The distribution and fulfillment centers are strategically located in proximity to major population centers, including the Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, Atlanta and Honolulu metro areas. 
Competitive Strengths 
We believe the following strengths fundamentally differentiate us from our competitors and drive our success:
One-stop shop with a diverse product offering for the foodservice market and highly nimble sourcing capabilities
We leverage our diversified global supplier network and offer customers a wide selection of single-use disposable foodservice products, with over 8,600 SKUs across a broad range of product categories. We have significantly grown our inventory sourcing network from only a handful of vendors initially to over 70 active vendors by the end of 2022. Key offerings include food and take-out containers, bags, tableware, cups, lids, cutlery and straws primarily sourced through our diverse supplier base. Our strong relationships with our suppliers allow us to offer customers products that both preserve the highest possible food quality and meet the unique needs of their business. Furthermore, these supplier relationships allow us to offer custom-branded and custom-designed products with fast turnaround times and at competitive prices. With increasing regulations around single use plastics, our Karat Earth® line provides environmentally friendly options that include food and take-out containers, bags, tableware, cups, lids, cutlery and straws. This special catalog of sustainable products are made from renewable resources that are ethically sourced. We intend to invest further in research and development for our Karat Earth® line to significantly expand our product offering to meet the needs of our customers and the evolving regulatory landscape.
We often are a key supply chain partner integral to the daily operations of our customers. Our ability to quickly provide premium products at competitive prices has typically allowed us to become a trusted supplier to our customers. Through an ongoing feedback loop, as customer demand varies and new needs emerge, we are able to act nimbly and qualify new suppliers quickly to augment our product offering. These capabilities make us a key partner to our customers. 
Focus on distribution and advanced logistics network, complemented by flexible manufacturing capabilities
We consider our increasingly sophisticated distribution capabilities and related strength in logistics to be an important core competency and key differentiator from our competitors. We own a fleet of 31 trucks, 41 trailers, 9 bobtails, one yard goat and 24 chassis, and as of December 31, 2022, employ 43 drivers in our logistics division. 
This model has resulted in more efficient distribution to customers, reducing the need for reliance on third-party logistics providers such as FedEx and United Parcel Service. Our strategically located facilities give us a strong national footprint, which positions us well to serve regions across the U.S. in a timely fashion. We intend to continue to add to our capabilities via further distribution center openings and expansions, the purchase of additional vehicles, the hiring of additional drivers and additional logistics service offerings.
Our California, Texas and Hawaii facilities have a portion of operational capacity dedicated to manufacturing capabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 26% of our revenues were generated from the sale of products manufactured in-house. We view distribution as our primary focus and growth driver while utilizing our manufacturing capabilities as a complement to the base distribution business. This approach allows us to procure products at competitive prices by being able to compare procurement costs versus domestic manufacturing costs to help determine whether it is more efficient to produce ourselves versus relying on suppliers.
Diverse and growing blue-chip customer base
We sell and distribute a broad portfolio of single-use disposable foodservice products to customers nationwide including leading chain restaurants, distributors, convenience stores, retail establishments and online customers. Our blue-chip customers include leading fast casual chains such as Chili’s Grill & Bar and Chipotle Mexican Grill, as well as fast food chains such as In-N-Out Burger, El Pollo Loco and Panda Express, among others. We intend to further expand our customer base by selling our products to non-traditional foodservice customers, including regional and national supermarket chains, airlines, sports and entertainment venues and other non-restaurant customers. Plans for such expansion are already underway and beginning to yield positive results and a diversification of our customer base.
Leader in eco-friendly products to address sustainability
We are committed to pursuing environmental sustainability and this is exhibited in every aspect of our business. We are amongst the leading companies in the supply of eco-friendly disposal foodservice products in the United States. Since our inception, we have made the conscious choice to never use Styrofoam in any of our products. In 2008, we established Karat Earth® as an eco-friendly line of foodservice products, including food and takeout containers, bags, tableware, cups, lids, cutlery and straws. In April 2022, we announced a definitive joint venture agreement to establish a new corporation to build a factory in Taiwan for the production of compostable bagasse foodservice products which have a low carbon footprint. The new factory is expected to produce approximately 7,500 tons of products annually, with the first shipment of products to customers expected in June 2023. We have consistently grown eco-friendly products as a percentage of our total product sales, and continued to invest in research and development to expand our eco-friendly product line to meet the needs of our customers and the evolving regulatory landscape. 
Customized solutions offering new product development, design, printing and logistics services
In recent years, we are seeing a growing trend towards takeout and at-home dining, and as a result the restaurant industry is becoming increasingly focused on receiving a customized, value-add, and customer oriented-experience when it comes to the packaging of their products. In order to promote brand familiarity and loyalty, we collaborate closely with our customers to develop and deliver custom products that meet the unique branding, color and schematics requirements of their businesses. Our in house domestic printing capability allows for fast turnaround times at competitive costs.
Experienced and growth-oriented management team
We have assembled a strong executive management team to lead our company in its next phase of growth, supported by a deep bench of functional area leads across the organization. Our co-founders Alan Yu and Marvin Cheng have worked together over the last 20 years to aggressively drive growth across the business. Joanne Wang joined us in 2003 and was appointed Chief Operating Officer in 2018, helping to drive our pricing structure and sales training programs and overseeing general operational functions. Our Chief Financial Officer, Jian Guo, joined us in 2022, bringing years of public company experience to further bolster our finance and accounting functions.
Growth Strategy 
Our goal is to become a leading single-source provider to a broad set of customers for all of their disposable foodservice products and related needs. We plan to continue to grow our business and increase our profitability through the following key initiatives:
Continue to build our e-commerce distribution channel
We believe there is an opportunity to significantly grow our higher margin e-commerce business to a more meaningful percent of revenue by continuing our investments in people, software and technology. By committing additional resources and upgrading our e-commerce platform and online advertising efforts, we expect to enhance our e-commerce experience to better support the needs of our customers. Our e-commerce retail channel is our highest margin channel of distribution. By offering our entire range of products online and bolstering our logistics capabilities, our customers can conveniently order products themselves on an ad hoc basis. 
Disrupt the traditional foodservice supply chain
The traditional foodservice supply chain consists of manufacturers selling through a multi-layer distribution and logistics network before the product reaches the end customer. As a full service distributor ourselves, we are able to provide products directly to the end user, eliminating the need for the traditional multi-layer supply chain. Environmental pressure on single-use disposable plastics is already causing a need for new sources of supply. The Karat Earth® brand is a plant-based line of compostable products that meets the growing demand for renewable and ethically-sourced products. Our nimble operating model can serve customers more quickly than the traditional supply chain, which allows us to react rapidly to customers’ changes in demand.
Grow our base business with incremental revenue from existing customers
We intend to continue to increase penetration within our existing customer base. We believe there is an opportunity to offer additional product lines allowing us to become a true “one-stop” supplier. Our unique ability to serve customers as a reliable supplier with strong customer service at competitive prices has positioned us to be a frequent recipient of requests for proposals from our existing customers as they look for new sources of supply. For the year ended December 31, 2022, net sales to distributors and national and regional chains, our two largest channels, grew 21.2% and 11.4%, respectively, from the year ended December 31, 2021, as we grew our business with existing customers and added new customers. Offering a larger range of products, coupled with our ability to provide custom specifications and configurations to existing products, will allow us to better serve the needs of our customers and increase retention further. We have historically experienced consistently high 
customer retention rates as a result of our dedication to our customers and our hands-on approach. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our major customer retention rate, defined as year over year retention of our top 100 customers, was 100%. 
Expand our customer base via new capabilities, geographies, products, services and end markets
We believe our addressable market continues to grow as emerging businesses like Grubhub, Uber Eats, DoorDash and others expand the need for foodservice disposable products and takeout and at-home dining remain a constant even as the pandemic started to recede. We plan to continue to add new experienced sales team members to broaden our reach and more efficiently provide customer service as we grow. We have made solid strides towards expanding our distribution footprint and capabilities in the United States by adding two distribution centers in 2022, and intend to continue our expansion efforts. In addition, we have continuously evaluated and expanded our product and service offerings to respond to customer demand and enter new end markets, including sports venues, supermarket chains, airlines and other non-traditional foodservice markets. We see substantial opportunity to further expand our customer base with many individual customers through our select food and drink offerings (i.e. bubble tea, coffee, sauces and syrups) available via our e-commerce channel. In addition, we see significant opportunity with supermarket chains to gain wallet share by providing fruit trays, vegetable containers, compostable meat trays and other related items, all of which are higher margin products than some of our other products.
Pursue strategic acquisitions
We have the opportunity to capitalize on our existing infrastructure and expertise by continuing to selectively pursue opportunistic acquisitions in order to expand the breadth of our distribution and logistics network, increase our operating efficiency and add additional products and capabilities. In April 2022, we announced a definitive joint venture agreement with Happiness Moon, Co. Ltd to establish a new corporation, Bio Earth Technology ("Bio Earth"), to build a new 180,000 square-foot factory in Taiwan for the production of compostable bagasse foodservice products. We continue to consider and evaluate certain acquisition opportunities across the United States that we expect would enhance our national footprint. Additionally, the potential to acquire existing and new suppliers, particularly in the U.S., may further reduce our reliance on the Asian supply chain, creating more diversified sourcing options for our customers.
Our Industry
The disposable foodservice products industry is large and growing. The primary categories of disposable foodservice products include food packaging, containers, tableware, cups, lids, cutlery, straws, napkins and bags. The large breadth and scope of products is reflected in the diverse nature of the industry participants, which range from large international conglomerates to smaller regional and niche companies. As a result, the industry is represented by a large number of companies and remains highly fragmented. Similarly, end customers of the disposable foodservice products industry are equally diverse in composition. The restaurant and foodservice categories that are the primary purchasers of our products include quick service restaurants, fast casual, convenience stores, specialty drink establishments, casual dining and increasingly, premium casual and family dining restaurants. We estimate our growth to significantly outpace the industry average given our increase in sales of high demand items like take-out containers and bags, our ability to continuously augment our product offering to address customer needs and our avoidance of product categories in decline, including materials in the process of being banned under various governmental regulations.
The industry is currently experiencing a period of both growth and transition as a result of several key factors that have emerged in recent years and have accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. These include the growing market for food delivery and take-out dining; new governmental regulations primarily resulting from an increasingly environmentally-conscious public; and growing consolidation within the disposable foodservice products industry. We believe that we will benefit from a continuation of these market trends due to our diverse product offering, customer-centric approach, commitment to environmentally-friendly products and the flexibility of our business model.
Food delivery and take-out
With the growing trend towards at-home dining and mobility-oriented e-commerce, food delivery and take-out dining are currently experiencing rapid growth. As consumer preferences have evolved, foodservice establishments have realized that the at-home dining experience is closely linked to the quality of the packaging utilized. Data from the National Restaurant Association and Technomic shows that operators are increasingly acknowledging the importance of off-premises dining and making it a strategic priority. Based on data from Uber’s acquisition of Postmates, the online delivery market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18.1% to $61 billion by 2025. This growth is driven in large part by e-commerce companies such as Grubhub, Uber Eats, DoorDash and others. We believe the market opportunity will continue to expand for years to come. In order to benefit from this growing market trend, foodservice establishments are actively trying to provide a high quality at-home dining customer experience that is comparable to the in-restaurant experience. Central to this effort is food quality and overall presentation where take-out containers and related products play a critical role. Restaurants are seeking to develop high quality, customized disposables that not only provide the freshest and best possible food experience, but also provide a premium, branded at-home dining experience.
Governmental regulations 
Environmental concerns regarding disposable products broadly have resulted in a number of significant changes that are specific to the foodservice industry, including regulations applicable to our customers. Many cities, states and local governments have been actively enacting legislation that prohibits certain types of end-products as well as the use of certain raw materials used in manufacturing. We expect this trend to continue on a national scale as foodservice establishments are looking to source alternative products made from biodegradable materials and other environmentally-friendly options. We believe we are well positioned to benefit from increasing government regulation and environmental concerns given our strong portfolio of sustainable products, including our Karat Earth® line and our continued commitment and investment in our leadership position in providing eco-friendly products in the United States.
Additionally, evolving foreign trade policy by the U.S. federal government has resulted in the imposition of tariffs on a number of imported foodservice disposable products, including those imported from China. To avoid the resulting higher product costs, many domestic purchasers may seek to establish alternative distribution channels and source products from U.S. based manufacturers or from other, non-tariffed countries.
Industry consolidation
Over the last several years, there has been significant consolidation within the industry, both in distribution and manufacturing. This is due in part to larger and more established companies seeking to generate growth and maintain profitability through the expansion of their product offering. As is common in the disposable foodservice products industry, larger companies typically broaden their product portfolio through the acquisition of established companies, rather than building out new product categories organically. As consolidation occurs, existing customers often find themselves facing challenges of changing product availability, discontinuations, increasing prices, support staff turnover and other potential transition-related challenges. These challenges can be highly disruptive to a customer’s business and as a result, the customers often seek out other stable and more reliable channels for product sourcing.
Our Products
We offer a wide selection of high-quality, cost effective food packaging products and disposables.
We work in close collaboration with our customers to develop products to meet the needs unique to their individual businesses. This includes developing containers and food storage items that are both visually appealing and that deliver the best possible food quality and freshness. Additionally, we are able to custom print or label many of our products, to help our customers brand the at home dining experience of their customers. We supply a wide range of products for the foodservice industry, including:
•    food and take-out containers;
•    bags;
•    tableware;
•    cups;
•    lids,
•    cutlery,
•    straws,
•    specialty beverage ingredients;
•    equipment; and
•    gloves.
Karat Earth®
Karat Earth® is our specialty line of environmentally-friendly products that are plant-based and compostable and are made from renewable resources sourced ethnically. This line includes food containers, tableware, cups, lids, utensils and straws. Our Karat Earth® line provides our customers the option to make a powerful statement about their commitment to environmental and social sustainability.
Our Karat Earth® products are Cedar Grove Certified (CGC) and Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI) certified compostable. Karat Earth® plastic products are made from polylactic acid (PLA) sourced from NatureWorks Ingeo PLA. Ingeo PLA is a non-petroleum based, biopolymer that is manufactured from plant sugars. Due to its material composition, Ingeo PLA is non-volatile, non-toxic and odorless if incinerated.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, net sales of our Karat Earth® products increased by 36% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. We continue to invest in research and development for our Karat Earth® line to expand our product offering to meet the needs of our customers and the evolving regulatory landscape. 
Our Distribution and Logistics Network
We sell and distribute our products to customers across the United States. We partner with foodservice establishments of every size, with our customers ranging from large multi-national restaurant chains to regional and smaller-chain establishments. Our customers benefit from our broad product offering which allows them to streamline their procurement process by purchasing all of their disposable goods from a single-source provider. We also sell our products directly to leading restaurant supply companies that distribute products to a wide range of food-service establishments internationally.
Our growing sales force works closely with our customers to tailor the optimal mix of products to meet the unique needs of their businesses. We continue to hire additional sales personnel nationally to expand our sales reach, geographic footprint and increase our penetration into the different market segments of the foodservice industry.
We work closely with our customers to develop an optimal logistics and supply chain solution customized to their businesses. We have built a flexible distribution system which allows our customers to order and receive products on a timely basis based on the real-time needs of their businesses. In addition to regularly scheduled delivery intervals, our customers can order and schedule delivery of products via telephone, facsimile, email or through our online e-commerce platform and our storefronts on Amazon.com and Walmart.com. Our regional warehouses and distribution centers allow us to deliver products on a timely basis to key population centers across the United States. Depending on the needs of our customers, final product delivery to their stores or affiliated distribution centers occurs via courier package delivery or through our company-employed delivery drivers.
E-Commerce
In 2004, we established our Company store website at www.lollicupstore.com, to provide an additional channel for our customers to purchase our products. The website offers our entire range of products for online procurement, and we believe it will continue to be a key growth driver for our business, as it enables us to cross market products to potential customers. We have also added third-party storefronts on Amazon and Walmart to complement our Company store website. Sales through these online channels accounted for 12.7% of total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022. We have recently made significant investments to further develop and upgrade the www.lollicupstore.com e-commerce platform to improve online traffic and order placements. 
Seasonality
Our business does not experience high seasonality though certain food and food related products are moderately seasonal. For example, during the hot weather of summer and fall months, we see an increase in the level of sales for items such as cold drink cups and boba products. Generally, we expect relatively more of our earnings and cash flows to be generated in the second and third quarter of the fiscal year.
Our Corporate Structure
Set forth below is an organizational chart which identifies the Company and its consolidated entities as:
Please see Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the agreements between our variable interest entity and us.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property portfolio includes 15 active trademarks, including Lollicup, Karat, Karat Earth® and Total Clean, and five registered copyrights. 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
At Karat Packaging, we are committed to pursuing initiatives that positively impact our products, our people, our customers and our planet. We recognize the importance of environmental, social and governance ("ESG") issues for all of our stakeholders and we are committed to incorporating ESG principles into our business strategies and organizational culture. By undertaking such measures, we hope to make our workforce more inclusive, our business more sustainable, and our communities more engaged. Our commitment to practicing environmental sustainability is exhibited in almost every aspect of our business.
Our Products
We are a pioneer and leader in the supply of eco-friendly disposal foodservice products in the United States. Since our inception, we made the conscious choice to never use Styrofoam in any of our products. The reason behind such a decision was that Styrofoam products are non-biodegradable and therefore take up permanent space in landfills resulting in a constant leach of harmful chemicals into the environment. Styrofoam products are also very difficult to clean up as they often escape waste collection systems due to their low density. They are easily wind-blown and ultimately end up in parks, forests, beaches, oceans and rivers.
In 2008, we established Karat Earth® as an eco-friendly line of foodservice products, including food and take out containers, bags, tableware, cups, lids, cutlery and straws. Our Karat Earth® products are Cedar Grove Certified (CGC) and Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI) certified compostable. Karat Earth® plastic products are made from polylactic acid (PLA) sourced from NatureWorks Ingeo PLA. Ingeo PLA is a non-petroleum based, biopolymer that is manufactured from 
plant sugars. Due to its material composition, Ingeo PLA is non-volatile, non-toxic and odorless if incinerated. We continue to invest in research and development to expand the product offering in our Karat Earth® line. During the year ended December 31, 2022, net sales of our Karat Earth® products increased by 36% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.
Fiscal year 2022 marked an important milestone in our continued efforts and commitment to sustainability. In April 2022, we announced a definitive joint venture agreement with Happiness Moon, Co. Ltd to establish a new corporation, Bio Earth, to build a new 180,000 square-foot factory in Taiwan for the production of compostable bagasse foodservice products. Bagasse has a low carbon footprint. Since it is a derivative of sugar cane, bagasse lifespan includes a period where atmospheric carbon is captured and converted to biomass. In the right conditions, bagasse can biodegrade in 30-90 days without toxic residue, and even provide nutrient-rich compost. Packaging made with bagasse is also fully recyclable. This makes it ideal for all levels of packaging. The new plant is expected to produce approximately 7,500 tons of products annually, with the first shipment of products to customers expected in June 2023.
A recent peer-reviewed global study conducted by the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences found that less than 10 percent of plastics is recycled. Other studies indicated approximately 23% of landfill waste in the United States is comprised of plastic containers and food ware. Such striking statistics have prompted many state and city governments to enact regulations to cut down on plastic pollution. For example, California passed the Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer Responsibility Act also known as SB 54 in June 2022, requiring all packaging in the state to be recyclable or compostable by 2032. In October 2021, the state of Washington adopted a statewide ban on certain carryout bags. Individual cities such as Los Angeles, San Diego and Honolulu have also passed their own complimentary ordinances to limit single-use plastic products. As more governments enact regulations to prevent and reduce waste that is harmful to the environment, and more consumers are actively taking steps towards being more sustainable, the demand for eco-friendly disposable products is on the rise. In order to better position ourselves for this change in the industry landscape, we have significantly expanded our eco-friendly product offerings. As of December 31, 2022, we have over 400 SKUs of eco-friendly products that our customers can choose from.
Our Operations
In our manufacturing facilities in the United States, the production process involves intake of water, dischargement to water, recycling of waste and other disposal activities. As a Company, we place strong emphasis on water conservation and reducing water pollution. Outside of the required cooling of manufacturing machines and equipment after production cycles, our manufacturing process does not require large quantities of water. We ensure appropriate drainage and disposal of contaminated water, grease oil and other chemicals discharged from our production activities in order to limit the pollution of valuable water sources. Reclamation is also a key consideration for us. Any and all waste products from our production process is thoroughly inspected and checked for the potential of re-use or recyclability. Identified items are repackaged and sold or they are transferred to our local waste management facilities for proper disposal, thereby reducing waste and the use of landfill space. Some of our raw materials are Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI) certified. For over 20 years, the BPI certification has been the defining symbol of compostability due to its rigorous testing standards. The BPI certification is the only third-party verification for compostable products in North America. Even in products that do require the use of plastic, we ensure that the resin we source is both BPA (or bisphenol A) and PFA (or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl) free. These substances are known for their extreme persistence in the environment upon discharge. Our warehouse departments also have certain sustainability practices implemented. By reusing paper cardboard boxes as well as wooden pallets for inventory storage and shipments, we are able to further reduce our carbon footprint.
We are regulated by certain federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of production materials and control of emissions. Compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or global competitive position.
A liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when we consider it probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations, cash flows or financial position.
We are committed to providing consistent and excellent return to our shareholders, all while maintaining a strong sense of good corporate citizenship that places a high value on the welfare of our employees, the communities in which we operate, and the world as a whole. We believe that effectively prioritizing and managing our ESG factors helps create long-term value for our investors. Under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and the board of directors, we are driving continuous improvements in bringing innovative eco-friendly products that meet the needs of our customers and our plant and enhancing our energy and waste management infrastructure in our sustainability journey.
Human Capital Management
Our Culture
At Karat, it is our people – our greatest asset – that give us our strong reputation and stand at the heart of our growth. Our success depends on the talent, dedication, and well-being of our people. As we grow, we strive to recruit, retain, develop, and provide advancement opportunities for our team members. We continually work to make Karat an inclusive, equitable, and growth-focused workplace where all team members have the opportunity to flourish.
Safety
One of our most important corporate values is the safeguarding of our people and fostering a culture of care that promotes the well-being of our employees, contractors and business partners. We protect our people, projects and reputation by striving for zero employee injuries and illnesses, while operating and delivering our work responsibly and sustainably. Our safety culture empowers every member of the workforce to exercise stop-work authority without repercussion to address any potential unsafe work conditions. We develop and administer company-wide safety policies to ensure the well-being of each team member and compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards. This includes periodic safety training and assessments as well as annual safety audits. We require all employees and contractors at our warehouse and manufacturing facilities to understand and follow these safety policies. These guidelines have been put into place by management to address three key components of safety:
•    Identifying the root cause of safety hazards in our operations;
•    Assessing risks associated with all hazards or conditions identified; and 
•    Mitigating risks associated with known hazards and conditions.
We also support the community uptake of approved COVID-19 vaccines as the most effective measure to control the global pandemic and we strongly encourage that our employees receive an approved vaccine. We have taken and will continue to take critical steps to keep our people, customers and communities safe from COVID-19. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)
Diversity, equity and inclusion ("DE&I") are critical underpinnings of our corporate values. DE&I helps foster innovation, cultivate an environment filled with unique perspectives and drive engagement, innovation and organizational growth. Our focus to date has been increasing awareness amongst our employees on the importance of DE&I.
As a business founded by representatives from a minority group in the United States, diversity and inclusion is engrained in our corporate history. We believe that a diverse workforce is essential to its long-term success and strives to foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture where all voices are heard, valued, and included. Management embraces employees’ differences in race, color, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, citizenship, national origin, geographic background, military or veteran status, disability (mental or physical), and any other characteristics that make our employees unique. We ensure that we leverage a diverse slate of candidates for all job vacancies, including senior leadership. 
Good corporate governance and transparency are fundamental to achieving our vision of becoming a leading in all our markets. Our engagement approach involves ongoing communication with our employees. We strive to provide relevant market updates to our team members as well as to share important information regarding our revenue trends, inventory status, production, safety and other operating metrics as deemed necessary. We have received several recognition oriented awards throughout our company’s history. Our employees are expected to act with integrity and objectivity and to always strive to enhance our reputation and performance. We maintain a Code of Ethics which is attested by every employee and provides our framework for ethical business.

Compensation and Benefits 
Consistent with our core values, we take care of our people by offering competitive compensation and comprehensive benefits programs. We continuously make wage investments to ensure our compensation packages reflect the evolving circumstances across our markets. One of the goals of our recruitment strategy is to ensure we are aligning roles with compensation levels based on job responsibilities, market competitiveness, geographic location, strategic importance of roles and other relevant factors.
Our compensation package includes a base salary and depending on the role, discretionary bonuses and equity compensation programs. In January 2019, the Company’s board of directors adopted the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). A total of 2,000,000 shares of common stock has been authorized and reserved for issuance under the Plan in the form of incentive or nonqualified stock options and stock awards. Employees, directors, and consultants are eligible to receive stock options and stock awards under the Plan. Additionally, the firm makes annual contributions to support the retirement goals of each employee through a matching contribution to 401(k) retirement accounts.

We also offer our employees’ healthcare, wellness, paid sick leave, flexible paid time off, and other benefits to support their quality of life and enable them to thrive in the workplace. All eligible full-time and part-time employees and their eligible dependents receive competitive health benefits. We cover approximately 60% of total eligible healthcare costs for part and full-time employees for our approximately 250 participating employees as of December 31, 2022.
Learning and Development
We believe that high performance is an outcome of a person’s ability to change, adapt, and grow their capabilities throughout their career. We emphasize real-life, real-time learning that enables a person to meet the demands of challenging and changing work and focuses on reinforcing key principles that are designed to support an individual’s effectiveness in his or her current job and in their future development. We provide technical and leadership training to employees, specifically our production and sales teams who work closely with our products and services. In particular, our focus on employee development has been structured over the last several years through programs designed to embed essential skills and reinforce strategic goals that are aligned to our culture. This is evidenced by the fact that we promoted 112 and 114 employees during the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 
Other Information
As of December 31, 2022, we had employed approximately 805 employees, out of which 781 were full-time employees. None of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have no labor-related work stoppages and believe our relations with our employees are good.
Corporate Information
We were founded in 2000 by Alan Yu and Marvin Cheng in San Gabriel, California as Lollicup USA Inc., a California corporation. Initially our business was focused on the establishment, franchising and licensing of bubble tea stores nationwide. Considered a pioneer for the bubble tea business in North America, our business grew rapidly from a single Lollicup Tea Café store in 2000 to more than 60 stores in 2006. In order to ensure consistency across our stores, we expanded our focus in 2004 to include the distribution of supplies for the bubble tea industry. In 2013, we sold the retail bubble tea business to certain of 
Lollicup’s shareholders. In 2014, as a result of a growing demand across the foodservice industry for our packaging goods, we began distributing and manufacturing products under our Karat brand in our California facility. 
In September 2018, we incorporated Karat Packaging Inc. in Delaware, and the Company, Lollicup, and Messrs. Yu and Cheng and the other shareholders of Lollicup (together, the “Lollicup Shareholders”) entered into a share exchange agreement and plan of reorganization whereby the Lollicup Shareholders exchanged their shares of common stock in Lollicup for an equal number of shares of common stock of the Company, resulting in Lollicup becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Our principal executive and administrative offices are located at 6185 Kimball Avenue, Chino, CA 91708, and our telephone number is (626) 965-8882. Our website address is www.karatpackaging.com.

We are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or (the "Exchange Act"), and have elected to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosure available for smaller reporting companies.
