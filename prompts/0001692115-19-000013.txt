Item 1. | BUSINESS

Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc., a California corporation, is a holding company headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, which either on its own or together with its subsidiaries is referred to herein as the “Company.” Through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Southwest Gas Corporation (“Southwest” or the “natural gas operations” segment) and Centuri Construction Group, Inc. (“Centuri” or the “utility infrastructure services” segment), the Company operates two business segments: natural gas operations and utility infrastructure services.
Southwest was incorporated in March 1931 under the laws of the state of California and provides regulated natural gas delivery services to customers in portions of Arizona, Nevada, and California. Public utility rates, practices, facilities, and service territories of Southwest are subject to regulatory oversight. The timing and amount of rate relief can materially impact results of operations. Natural gas purchases and the timing of related recoveries can materially impact liquidity. Results for the natural gas operations segment are higher during winter periods due to the seasonality incorporated in its regulatory rate structures.
Centuri is a comprehensive utility infrastructure services enterprise dedicated to delivering a diverse array of solutions to North America’s gas and electric providers. Centuri derives revenue from installation, replacement, repair, and maintenance of energy distribution systems, and developing industrial construction solutions. Centuri operations are generally conducted under the business names of NPL Construction Co. (“NPL”), Canyon Pipeline Construction, Inc. (“Canyon”), NPL Canada Ltd. (“NPL Canada”), New England Utility Constructors, Inc. (“Neuco”), and W.S. Nicholls Construction, Inc. (“W.S. Nicholls”). In November 2018, the Company, through its subsidiaries, led principally by Centuri, completed the acquisition of an 80% interest in a privately held infrastructure services business, Linetec Services, LLC (“Linetec”). Centuri results are also seasonal with lower revenues during the first quarter of the year due to unfavorable winter weather conditions. Operating revenues typically improve as more favorable weather conditions occur during the summer and fall months.
Financial information concerning the Company’s business segments is included in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in the 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders and is incorporated herein by reference.
Southwest Gas Holdings maintains a website (www.swgasholdings.com) for the benefit of shareholders, investors, customers, and other interested parties.

NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS
General Description
Southwest is subject to regulation by the Arizona Corporation Commission (the “ACC”), the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (the “PUCN”), and the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”). These commissions regulate public utility rates, practices, facilities, and service territories in their respective states. The CPUC also regulates the issuance of all debt securities by Southwest, with the exception of short-term borrowings. Certain accounting practices, transmission facilities, and rates are subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”). Centuri, by contrast, is not regulated by the state utilities commissions or by the FERC in any of its operating areas.
As of December 31, 2018, Southwest purchased and distributed or transported natural gas to 2,047,000 residential, commercial, and industrial customers in geographically diverse portions of Arizona, Nevada, and California. Southwest added 32,000 net new customers during 2018. Southwest expects similar customer growth in 2019.
The table below lists the percentage of operating margin (operating revenues less net cost of gas) by major customer class for the years indicated:

 | Distribution | | 
For the Year Ended | Residential andSmall Commercial | | Other SalesCustomers | | Transportation
December 31, 2018 | 85 | % | | 3 | % | 12 | %
December 31, 2017 | 85 | % | | 3 | % | 12 | %
December 31, 2016 | 85 | % | | 3 | % | 12 | %

Southwest is not dependent on any one or a few customers such that the loss of any one or several would have a significant adverse impact on earnings or cash flows.
Transportation of customer-secured gas to end-users accounted for 48% of total system throughput in 2018, but only 12% of operating margin as shown in the table above. Customers who utilized this service transported 105 million dekatherms in 2018, 97 million dekatherms in 2017, and 97 million dekatherms in 2016.
The demand for natural gas is seasonal, with greater demand in the colder winter months and decreased demand in the warmer summer months. It is the opinion of management that comparisons of earnings for interim periods do not reliably reflect overall trends and changes in operations due to this seasonality. The decoupled rate mechanisms in place in the three-state service territory, as described below, are structured with seasonal variations. Also, earnings for interim periods can be significantly affected by the timing of general rate relief.
Rates and Regulation
Rates that Southwest is authorized to charge its distribution system customers are determined by the ACC, PUCN, and CPUC in general rate cases and are derived using rate base, cost of service, and cost of capital experienced in an historical test year, as adjusted in Arizona and Nevada, and projected for a future test year in California. The FERC regulates the northern Nevada transmission and liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) storage facilities of Paiute Pipeline Company (“Paiute”), a wholly owned subsidiary, and the rates it charges for transportation of gas directly to certain end-users and to various local distribution companies (“LDCs”). The LDCs transporting on the Paiute system are: NV Energy (serving Reno and Sparks, Nevada) and Southwest (serving Truckee, South and North Lake Tahoe in California, and various locations throughout northern Nevada).
Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class and rate jurisdiction and are set at levels that are intended to allow for the recovery of all commission-approved costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt as well as a reasonable return on common equity. Rate base consists generally of the original cost of utility plant in service net of amounts associated with costs borne by third parties, plus certain other assets such as working capital and inventories, less accumulated depreciation on utility plant in service, net deferred income tax liabilities, and certain other deductions. In association with the enactment of the legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) in December 2017, the corporate U.S. income tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21% and management was required to remeasure deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of 2017. Excess net deferred taxes were reclassified to a regulatory liability, which reduces rate base in a similar fashion as when the amounts were included in the deferred tax liability.

2

Rate structures in all service territories allow Southwest to separate or “decouple” the recovery of operating margin from natural gas consumption, though decoupled structures (alternative revenue programs) vary by state. In California, authorized operating margin levels vary by month. In Nevada and Arizona, the decoupled rate structures apply to most customer classes on the basis of margin per customer, which varies by month. Collectively, these mechanisms provide stability in annual operating margin.
Rate schedules in all service areas contain deferred energy or purchased gas adjustment provisions, which allow Southwest to file for rate adjustments as the cost of purchased gas changes. Deferred energy and purchased gas adjustment (collectively “PGA”) rate changes affect cash flows, but have no direct impact on profit margin. Filings to change rates in accordance with PGA clauses are subject to audit by the appropriate state regulatory commission staff.
Information with respect to recent general rate cases, PGA filings, and other regulatory proceedings is included in the Rates and Regulatory Proceedings section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) in the 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is filed as exhibit 13.01 hereto and incorporated by reference.

Demand for Natural Gas
Deliveries of natural gas by Southwest are made under a priority system established by state regulatory commissions. The priority system is intended to ensure that the gas requirements of higher-priority customers, primarily residential customers and other customers who use 500 therms or less of gas per day, are fully satisfied on a daily basis before lower-priority customers, primarily electric utility and large industrial customers able to use alternative fuels, are provided any quantity of gas or capacity.
Demand for natural gas is greatly affected by temperature. On cold days, use of gas by residential and commercial customers can be as much as seven times greater than on warm days because of increased use of gas for space heating. To fully satisfy this increased high-priority demand, gas is withdrawn from storage in certain service areas, or peaking supplies are purchased from suppliers. If necessary, service to interruptible lower-priority customers may be curtailed to provide the needed delivery system capacity. Southwest maintains no significant backlog on its orders for gas service.
Natural Gas Supply
Southwest is responsible for acquiring and arranging delivery of natural gas to its system in sufficient quantities to meet its sales customers’ needs. Southwest’s primary natural gas procurement objective is to ensure that adequate supplies of natural gas are available at a reasonable cost. Southwest acquires natural gas from a wide variety of sources with a mix of purchase provisions, which includes spot market and firm supplies. The purchases may have terms from one day to several years and utilize both fixed and indexed pricing. During 2018, Southwest acquired natural gas from 35 suppliers. Southwest regularly monitors the number of suppliers, their performance, and their relative contribution to the overall customer supply portfolio. New suppliers are contracted when possible, and solicitations for supplies are extended to the largest practicable list of suppliers, taking into account each supplier’s creditworthiness. Competitive pricing, flexibility in meeting Southwest’s requirements, and demonstrated reliability of service are instrumental to any one supplier’s inclusion in Southwest’s portfolio. The goal of this practice is to mitigate the risk of nonperformance by any one supplier and ensure competitive prices in the portfolio.
Balancing reliability with supply cost results in a continually changing mix of purchase provisions within the supply portfolios. To address the unique requirements of its various market areas, Southwest assembles and administers a separate natural gas supply portfolio for each of its jurisdictional areas. Southwest facilitates most natural gas purchases through competitive bid processes.

To mitigate customer exposure to short-term market price volatility, Southwest seeks to fix the price on a portion (up to 25% in the Arizona and California jurisdictions) of its forecasted annual normal-weather volume requirement, primarily using firm, fixed-price purchasing arrangements that are secured periodically throughout the year. Southwest’s price volatility mitigation program includes the use of financial derivatives, in the form of fixed-for-floating-index-price swaps combined with indexed-price physical purchases, to secure a portion of the fixed-price portfolio for the Arizona rate jurisdiction. The combination of fixed-price contracts and financial derivatives is designed to increase flexibility for Southwest and increase supplier diversification. The cost of such financial derivatives combined with the associated indexed-price physical purchases is recovered from customers through the PGA mechanism. Southwest does not currently enter into swaps or fixed-price purchases for its Nevada territories.
For the 2018/2019 heating season, fixed-price physical commodity purchases ranged from approximately $2.05 to approximately $4.15 per dekatherm. Southwest makes non-fixed-price natural gas purchases under variable-price contracts with firm quantities or on the spot market. Prices for these contracts are determined at the beginning of each month to reflect that month’s published first-of-month index price or based on a published daily price index. These monthly or daily index prices are not published or known until the purchase period begins.
The firm natural gas supply arrangements are structured such that a stated volume of natural gas is required to be nominated by Southwest and delivered by the supplier. Contracts provide for fixed or market-based penalties to be paid by the non-performing party.
Storage availability may influence the average annual price of natural gas, as storage may allow a company to purchase natural gas quantities during the off-peak season and store it for use in high demand periods when prices may be greater or supplies/capacity tighter. Dependent upon the rate jurisdiction, Southwest has varying degrees of access to storage services, but overall there are a small quantity of storage services available for Southwest’s use. For available storage services, Southwest purchases natural gas for injection during the off-peak period for use in the high demand months; however, since there is a small quantity of storage services available, storage has a limited impact on Southwest’s annual average price of natural gas. Additionally, Southwest utilizes most available storage services for operational purposes to meet customer demand and not for economic purposes. This also limits the influence the available storage services have on Southwest’s average annual price of natural gas.
Southwest currently has no storage service availability in its southern Nevada rate jurisdiction. Southwest has limited storage service availability for the southern and northern California, northern Nevada, and Arizona rate jurisdictions. The following summarizes Southwest’s access to storage services for those rate jurisdictions.
Southwest has a contract with Southern California Gas Company for use only within Southwest’s southern California rate jurisdiction.
Southwest contracts for storage services from Paiute’s LNG facility. This storage service provides peaking capability only for the northern Nevada and northern California rate jurisdictions. 
Southwest also has interruptible storage contracts with Northwest Pipeline Corporation (“NWPL”) for the northern Nevada and northern California rate jurisdictions. NWPL has the discretion to limit Southwest’s ability to inject or withdraw from this interruptible storage, which consequently limits Southwest’s use of this interruptible storage capacity. As such, this storage provides limited operational flexibility to adjust daily flowing supplies to meet demand.
For the Arizona rate jurisdiction, Southwest contracts with Enstor Grama Ridge Storage and Transportation, LLC (“Enstor”) which provides for a maximum inventory quantity of 600,000 dekatherms of underground storage in New Mexico that is deliverable to the El Paso system. This contract terminates at the end of March 2019. In January 2014, Southwest filed an application with the ACC seeking pre-approval to construct, operate and maintain a 233,000 dekatherm LNG facility in southern Arizona. This facility is intended to enhance service reliability and flexibility in natural gas deliveries in the southern Arizona area by providing a local storage option, to be operated by Southwest and connected directly to its distribution system. In December 2014, Southwest received an order from the ACC granting pre-approval of Southwest's application to construct the LNG facility and the deferral of costs, up to $50 million. The approval was later modified in December 2016 to reflect a not-to-exceed amount of $80 million following the site purchase, detailed engineering design specifications, and solicitation of bids for the engineering, procurement, and construction of the facility. Construction began during the third quarter of 2017 and is expected to be substantially complete in the second quarter of 2019 with the facility available for use during the winter of 2019/2020. Costs incurred, to the extent not exceeding the modified authorization, are expected to begin being recovered with the effective date of the general rate proceeding following the in-service date. The gas costs incurred following the in-service date are expected to be recovered on an ongoing basis through the PGA mechanism. Through December 2018, Southwest has incurred approximately $60 million in capital expenditures toward the project (including land acquisition costs).

Natural gas supplies for Southwest’s southern system (Arizona, southern Nevada, and southern California properties) are primarily obtained from producing regions in Colorado and New Mexico (San Juan basin), Texas (Permian basin), and Rocky Mountain areas. For its northern system (northern Nevada and northern California properties), Southwest primarily obtains natural gas from Rocky Mountain producing areas and from Canada.
The landscape for national natural gas supply is continuously changing. Advanced drilling techniques continue to provide access to abundant and sustainable natural gas supplies. The natural gas market has responded to the abundant supply of natural gas with reductions to both price volatility and the total price of the commodity. Forecasts show that an ample and diverse natural gas supply is available to Southwest’s customers at a highly competitive price when compared with competing forms of energy.
Southwest arranges for transportation of natural gas to its Arizona, Nevada, and California service territories through the pipeline systems of El Paso Natural Gas Company (“El Paso”), Kern River Gas Transmission Company (“Kern River”), Transwestern Pipeline Company (“Transwestern”), NWPL, Tuscarora Gas Pipeline Company (“Tuscarora”), Southern California Gas Company, Paiute, and Ruby Pipeline LLC (“Ruby”), costs for which are recovered from Southwest’s customers through the PGA mechanism. Southwest regularly monitors short- and long-term supply and pipeline capacity availability to ensure the reliability of service to its customers. Southwest currently receives firm transportation service, both on a short- and long-term basis, for all of its service territories on the pipeline systems noted above. Southwest also contracts for firm natural gas supplies that are delivered to Southwest’s city gates to supplement its firm capacity on the interstate pipelines and to meet projected peak-day demands. Southwest could also utilize its interruptible contracts on the interstate pipelines for the transportation of additional natural gas supplies.
Southwest believes that the current levels of contracted firm interstate capacity and delivered purchases are sufficient to serve each of its service territories’ forecasted peak-day requirements. As the need arises to acquire additional capacity on one of the interstate pipeline transmission systems and to secure additional supply, primarily due to customer growth, Southwest will continue to consider available options to obtain that capacity (either through the use of firm contracts with a pipeline company or by purchasing capacity on the open market), and will also consider options for the purchase of additional firm delivered natural gas supplies.
Competition
Electric utilities are the principal competitors of Southwest for the residential and small commercial markets throughout its service areas. Competition for space heating, general household, and small commercial energy needs generally occurs at the initial installation phase when the customer/builder typically makes the decision as to which type of equipment to install and operate. The customer will generally continue to use the chosen energy source for the life of the equipment. Southwest interfaces directly with the various home builders and commercial property developers in its service territories to ensure that natural gas appliances are considered in new developments and commercial centers. As a result of its efforts, Southwest has continued to experience growth in the new construction market among residential and small commercial customer classes.
Certain large commercial, industrial, and electric generation customers have the capability to switch to alternative energy sources. To date, Southwest has been successful in retaining most of these customers by setting rates (subject to conditions of the respective state tariffs) at levels competitive with commercially available alternative energy sources such as electricity and fuel oils. However, high natural gas prices can impact Southwest’s ability to retain some of these customers. Alternative energy has gained momentum in governmental policy overall in recent years. Southwest has taken steps to align with these efforts by supporting energy efficiency in our jurisdictions, being part of greenhouse gas protocols and initiatives in California, and recently creating new biogas and renewable natural gas tariff schedules in Arizona and Nevada. While certain forms of renewable energy initiatives compete with natural gas, the abundance and low cost of natural gas provide competitive advantages across our portfolio of customers. Overall, management does not anticipate any material adverse impact on operating margin from fuel switching or alternative energy initiatives over the near term. 
Southwest competes with interstate transmission pipeline companies, such as El Paso, Kern River, Transwestern, Tuscarora, and Ruby to provide service to certain large end-users. End-use customers located in proximity to these interstate pipelines pose a potential bypass threat. Southwest closely monitors each customer situation and provides competitive service in order to retain the customer. Southwest has remained competitive through the use of negotiated transportation contract rates (subject to conditions of the respective state tariffs), special long-term contracts with electric generation and cogeneration customers, and other tariff programs. These competitive response initiatives have mitigated the loss of operating margin earned from large customers.

Environmental Matters
Federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment have a direct impact upon Southwest. Environmental efforts, with respect to matters such as storm water management, emissions of air pollutants, hazardous material management, protection of endangered species and archaeological resources, directly impact the complexity and time required to obtain pipeline rights-of-way and construction permits. There have also been a number of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in recent years in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions (“GHGs”), such as carbon dioxide. The adoption of this type of legislation by Congress or similar legislation by state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the future could have significant impacts on the energy industry. Such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs for us or additional operating restrictions on our business, affect the demand for natural gas, or impact the prices we charge our customers. At this time, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations, if adopted, on our future business, financial condition, or results. However, increased environmental legislation and regulation can also be beneficial to the natural gas industry. Natural gas is one of the most environmentally-friendly fossil fuels currently available and its use can help energy users comply with stricter environmental air quality standards.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and the State of California Environmental Protection Agency (the “Cal/EPA”) have issued regulations that require the reporting of GHGs from large sources and suppliers in order to facilitate the development of policies and programs to reduce GHGs. Southwest reports required information to the EPA and Cal/EPA under respective rules including the volumes of natural gas that it receives for distribution to LDC customers, and the GHG emissions that result from the operation of its LDC pipelines. While some aspects of the mandatory reporting rules do not apply to Southwest, other required information is being reported to the Department of Energy, the Department of Transportation, or is available in existing databases. Management also monitors the development of climate legislation (including the State of California Global Warming Solutions Act), which could result in additional requirements or have financial implications.
California Assembly Bill Number 32 and the regulations promulgated by the California Air Resources Board (the “CARB”), require Southwest, as a covered entity, to comply with all of the requirements associated with the California GHG Emissions Reporting Program and the California Cap and Trade Program. The objective of these programs is to reduce California statewide GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Southwest must report annual GHG emissions each year. The CARB annually allocates to Southwest a certain number of allowances based on Southwest’s reported 2011 GHG emissions. Of those allocated allowances, Southwest must consign a certain percentage to the CARB for auction. Southwest can use any allocated allowances that remain after consignment, along with allowances it can purchase through CARB auctions or reserve sales, or through over the counter (“OTC”) purchases with other market participants, to meet its compliance obligations. 
There were two three-year compliance periods established; one which ended in 2017 and the other, ending in 2020. Southwest successfully met the first three-year compliance obligation by surrendering a sufficient number of allowances prior to November 1, 2018. The CPUC issued a decision that provides for the regulatory treatment of the program costs. The decision also implemented the California Climate Credit in October 2018, representing a return of auction proceeds, which will be updated annually. There is no expected impact on earnings. 
Employees
At December 31, 2018, Southwest had 2,312 regular full-time equivalent employees. Southwest believes it has a good relationship with its employees and that compensation, benefits, and working conditions afforded its employees are comparable to those generally found in the utility industry. No employees are represented by a union.
UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES
Centuri is a comprehensive utility infrastructure services enterprise dedicated to delivering a diverse array of solutions to North America’s gas and electric providers. Centuri derives revenue from installation, replacement, repair, and maintenance of energy distribution systems, and developing industrial construction solutions. The primary focus of Centuri operations is replacement of natural gas distribution pipe and electric service lines as well as new infrastructure installations. Utility infrastructure services work varies from relatively small projects to the installation of infrastructure for entire residential communities or business parks. Utility infrastructure services activity is seasonal in most of Centuri’s operating areas. Peak periods are the summer and fall months in colder climate areas, such as the northeastern and midwestern U.S. and Canada. In warmer climate areas, such as the southwestern and southeastern U.S., utility infrastructure services activity continues year round. 
During the past few years, various factors resulted in an increase in large multi-year utility system replacement programs. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) instituted 

6

Distribution Integrity Management Programs (“DIMP”) effective February 2010 which required operators of gas distribution pipelines to develop and implement integrity management programs to enhance safety by identifying and reducing pipeline integrity risks. The U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 established mandatory electric grid reliability standards and incentivized investments in transmission and distribution systems. The FERC Order No. 1000, issued in July 2011, established transmission planning requirements to encourage development of electric transmission infrastructure projects. Also contributing to the increase in replacement projects were bonus depreciation tax deduction incentives. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 extended 50% bonus depreciation tax deduction incentives through 2017. The TCJA enacted in December 2017 eliminated bonus depreciation tax deduction incentives for most of Centuri’s utility customers. 
Centuri’s contract terms with utility customers generally specify unit-price, fixed-price, or time and materials arrangements. Unit-price contracts establish prices for all of the various services to be performed during the contract period. These contracts often have annual pricing reviews. During 2018, approximately 83% of revenue was earned under unit-price contracts. Backlog represents the dollar amount of revenue Centuri expects to recognize in the future from contracts awarded and in progress as of the end of the reporting period. Reported backlog differs from the concept of remaining performance obligations as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and is not a measure of contract profitability. As of December 31, 2018, backlog of approximately $115.1 million existed with respect to outstanding fixed-priced contracts.
Materials used by Centuri in its utility infrastructure service activities are typically specified, purchased, and supplied by Centuri’s customers. Contracts with customers also contain provisions which make customers generally liable for remediating environmental hazards encountered during the construction process. Such hazards might include digging in an area that was contaminated prior to construction, finding endangered animals, digging in historically significant sites, etc. Otherwise, Centuri’s operations have limited environmental impact (dust control, normal waste disposal, handling harmful materials, etc).
Competition within the industry has traditionally been limited to several regional and numerous local competitors in what has been a largely fragmented industry. Some national competitors also exist within the industry. Centuri currently operates in 26 major markets within the U.S. and in 2 major markets within the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Ontario. During 2018, Centuri served over 100 customers, with Southwest accounting for approximately 9% of total revenue. Additionally, two customers combined accounted for approximately 20% of total revenue, while five other customers individually accounted for 5% or more of total revenue.
Employee headcount fluctuates between seasonal periods, which are normally heaviest in the summer and fall months. At December 31, 2018, Centuri had 6,320 regular full-time equivalent employees. Employment peaked in June 2018 when there were 7,410 employees. Most employees are represented by unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements, which is typical of the utility infrastructure services industry.
Centuri’s operations are conducted from 36 field locations throughout the U.S. and 10 field locations within Canada, with its corporate headquarters located in Phoenix, Arizona. Buildings and equipment storage yards are normally leased from third parties over a term of five years or less.
Centuri is not directly affected by regulations promulgated by the ACC, PUCN, CPUC, or FERC. Centuri is an unregulated subsidiary of the Company. However, because Centuri performs work for Southwest, its associated costs are subject indirectly to “prudency reviews” like any other capital work performed by third parties or directly by Southwest. However, such “prudency reviews” would not bring Centuri under the regulatory jurisdiction of any of the commissions noted above.
Centuri has a 95% interest in IntelliChoice Energy, LLC (“ICE”) and consolidates ICE as a majority owned subsidiary. ICE was established in 2009 to market natural gas engine-driven heating, ventilating, and air conditioning technology and products. ICE has not been a significant component of Centuri operating results.
Centuri, through its subsidiaries, holds a 50% interest in W.S. Nicholls Western Construction LTD. (“Western”), a Canadian infrastructure services company that specializes in construction of underground aviation fueling systems and storage tanks. Western is a variable interest entity of which the Company is not the primary beneficiary; therefore, Western is not consolidated with Centuri and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. To date, Western, has not been a significant component of Centuri’s financial results.
