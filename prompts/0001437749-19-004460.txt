Overview
 
The Company
 
FNCB Bancorp, Inc., formerly First National Community Bancorp, Inc., incorporated in 1997, is a Pennsylvania business corporation and a registered bank holding company headquartered in Dunmore, Pennsylvania. FNCB Bancorp, Inc. became an active bank holding company on July 1, 1998 when it acquired 100% ownership of the former First National Community Bank. In this report, the terms “FNCB,” "the Company," “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to FNCB Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. In certain circumstances, however, FNCB Bancorp, Inc. uses the term “FNCB” to refer to itself. 
 
Effective June 30, 2016, following receipt of required regulatory approvals from the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, First National Community Bank completed a charter conversion from a national bank to a Pennsylvania state bank. Following the change in charter, First National Community Bank changed its legal name to FNCB Bank (the “Bank”). Subsequently, on October 4, 2016, the holding company filed an amendment to its articles of incorporation to change its name from First National Community Bancorp, Inc. to FNCB Bancorp, Inc. The name change became effective October 17, 2016. 
 
FNCB’s primary activity consists of owning and operating the Bank, which provides substantially all of FNCB’s earnings as a result of its banking services. 
 
FNCB had net income of $13.3 million, $0.1 million, and $6.3 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Total assets were $1.238 billion at December 31, 2018, $1.162 billion at December 31, 2017 and $1.196 billion at December 31, 2016.
 
The Bank
 
Established as a national banking association in 1910, as of December 31, 2018 the Bank operated 16 full-service branch offices within its primary market area, Northeastern Pennsylvania, and a Limited Purpose Banking Office (“LPO”) based in Allentown, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania.

Lending Activities
 
FNCB offers a variety of loans, including residential real estate loans, construction, land acquisition and development loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, loans to state and political subdivisions, and consumer loans, generally to individuals and businesses in its primary market area. These lending activities are described in further detail below.
Residential Mortgage Loans and Home Equity Term Loans
 
FNCB offers a variety of fixed-rate one- to four-family residential loans and home equity term loans. FNCB’s suite of residential mortgage products include First Time Homebuyer mortgages, FHA and Home Possible® mortgages with low down payments to meet the home financing needs of customers. Home equity term loans have fixed interest rates with terms up to 15 years. FNCB also offers a proprietary “WOW” mortgage, a first-lien, fixed-rate mortgage product with maturity terms ranging from 7.5 to 14.5 years. At December 31, 2018, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans totaled $164.8 million, or 19.7%, of the total loan portfolio. Except for the WOW mortgage, one- to four-family mortgage loans are originated generally for sale in the secondary market. However, FNCB may hold in portfolio one- to four-family residential mortgage loans as deemed necessary according to current asset/liability management strategies. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Bank sold $9.6 million of one- to four-family mortgages. FNCB retains servicing rights on these mortgages. 
Construction, Land Acquisition and Development Loans
 
FNCB offers interim construction financing secured by residential property for the purpose of constructing one- to four-family homes. FNCB also offers interim construction financing for the purpose of constructing residential developments and various commercial properties including shopping centers, office complexes and single purpose owner-occupied structures and for land acquisition. At December 31, 2018, construction, land acquisition and development loans amounted to $20.8 million and represented 2.5% of the total loan portfolio. 
 
Commercial Real Estate Loans
 
Commercial real estate loans represent the largest portion of FNCB’s total loan portfolio and loans in this portfolio generally have larger loan balances. These loans are secured by a broad range of real estate, including but not limited to, office complexes, shopping centers, hotels, warehouses, gas stations, convenience markets, residential care facilities, nursing care facilities, restaurants, multifamily housing, farms and land subdivisions. At December 31, 2018, FNCB’s commercial real estate loans totaled $262.8 million, or 31.5%, of the total loan portfolio.
Commercial and Industrial Loans
 
FNCB generally offers commercial loans to sole proprietors and businesses located in its primary market area. The commercial loan portfolio includes, but is not limited to, lines of credit, dealer floor plan lines, equipment loans, vehicle loans and term loans. These loans are primarily secured by vehicles, machinery and equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, marketable securities and deposit accounts. At December 31, 2018, FNCB’s commercial and industrial loans totaled $151.0 million, or 18.1%, of the total loan portfolio. 
Consumer Loans
 
Consumer loans include indirect automobile loans originated through various auto dealers in the Bank's market area, secured and unsecured installment loans, direct new and used automobile financing, home equity and personal lines of credit and overdraft protection loans.  Home equity lines of credit have adjustable interest rates based on the National prime interest rate and are offered up to a maximum combined loan-to-value ratio of 90%, based on the property’s appraised value. At December 31, 2018, FNCB’s consumer loans totaled $176.8 million, or 21.2%, of the total loan portfolio.
 
 4


State and Political Subdivision Loans
 
FNCB originates state and political subdivision loans, including general obligation and tax anticipation notes, primarily to municipalities in the Bank’s market area. At December 31, 2018, FNCB’s state and political subdivision loans totaled $59.0 million, or 7.1%, of the total loan portfolio.
 
For more information regarding FNCB’s loan portfolio and lending policies, please refer to Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Wealth Management
 
FNCB offers customers wealth management services through a third-party provider. Customers are able to access alternative deposit products such as mutual funds, annuities, stocks, and bonds directly for purchase from an outside provider.
 
Deposit Activities
 
In general, deposits, borrowings and loan repayments are the major sources of funding for lending and other investment purposes. FNCB relies primarily on marketing, product innovation, technology and service to attract, grow and retain its deposits. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of deposit accounts, management considers the interest rates offered by its competitors, the interest rates available on FHLB advances and other wholesale funding, its liquidity needs and customer preferences. Management regularly reviews FNCB’s deposit mix and deposit pricing as part of its asset/liability management, taking into consideration rates offered by competitors in its market area and balance sheet interest-rate sensitivity. 
 
Competition
 
The banking and financial services industries are highly competitive. FNCB faces direct competition in originating loans and in attracting deposits from a significant number of financial institutions operating in its market area, many with a statewide or regional presence, and in some cases, a national presence, as well as other financial and non-financial institutions outside of its market area through online loan and deposit product offerings. The competition comes principally from other banks, savings institutions, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, internet-based financial technology (“FinTech”) companies and, with respect to deposits, institutions offering investment alternatives, including money market funds and online deposit accounts. The increased competition has resulted from changes in the legal and regulatory guidelines, as well as from economic conditions. The cost of regulatory compliance remains high for community banks as compared to their larger competitors that are able to achieve economies of scale. 
 
As a result of consolidation in the banking industry, some of the Bank’s competitors and their respective affiliates are larger and may enjoy advantages such as greater financial resources, a wider geographic presence, a wider array of services, or more favorable pricing alternatives and lower origination and operating costs. FNCB considers its major competitors to be local commercial banks as well as other commercial banks with branches in its market area. Competitors may offer deposits at higher rates and loans with lower fixed rates, more attractive terms and less stringent credit structures than FNCB has been able to offer. The growth and profitability of FNCB depends on its continued ability to successfully compete. Management believes interest rates on deposits, especially money market and time deposits, and interest rates and fees charged on loans within FNCB’s market area to be very competitive.
 
Supervision and Regulation
 
FNCB and the Bank operate in a highly regulated industry and is subject to a variety of statutes, regulations and policies, as well as ongoing regulatory supervision and review. Federal statutes that apply to FNCB and the Bank include the Gramm Leach Bliley Act (“GLB Act”), the Bank Holding Company Act (“BHCA”), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the USA Patriot Act, the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. In general, these statutes, regulations promulgated in accordance with these statutes, and interpretations of the statutes and regulations by the banking regulatory agencies establish the eligible business activities of FNCB and the Bank, certain acquisition and merger restrictions, limitations on intercompany transactions, such as loans and dividends, and capital adequacy requirements, among other things. These laws, regulations and policies are subject to frequent change and FNCB takes measures to comply with applicable requirements.The following summarizes some of the more significant provisions of these laws as they relate to FNCB and the Bank.
FNCB
 
FNCB is a bank holding company within the meaning of the BHCA and is registered with, and subject to regulation and examination by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”). FNCB is required to file annual and quarterly reports with the FRB and to provide the FRB with such additional information that they may require. BHCA and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe and unsound banking practices.
 
 5


The BHCA requires approval of the FRB for, among other things, the acquisition of direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent (5%) of the voting securities or substantially all the assets of any bank or bank holding company, or before the merger or consolidation with another bank holding company.  
 
With certain limited exceptions, a bank holding company is prohibited from acquiring control of any voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in any activity other than banking or managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing services for its authorized subsidiaries.  A bank holding company may, however, engage in, or acquire an interest in a company that engages in, activities that the FRB has determined by order or regulation to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be properly incident thereto.  In making such a determination, the FRB is required to consider whether the performance of such activities can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as convenience, increased competition or gains in efficiency, which outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices. The FRB is also empowered to differentiate between activities commenced de novo and activities commenced by the acquisition, in whole or in part, of a going concern.  Some of the activities that the FRB has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking include making or servicing loans, performing certain data processing services, acting as a fiduciary or investment or financial advisor, and making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare.
 
Subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on any extensions of credit to the bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries, or investments in the stock or other securities thereof, and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower.  Further, a holding company and any subsidiary bank are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with the extension of credit.  
 
The GLB Act allows a bank holding company or other company to certify status as a financial holding company, which allows such company to engage in activities that are financial in nature, that are incidental to such activities, or are complementary to such activities without further approval. The GLB Act enumerates certain activities that are deemed financial in nature, such as underwriting insurance or acting as an insurance principal, agent or broker, underwriting, dealing in or making markets in securities, and engaging in merchant banking under certain restrictions. The GLB Act also authorizes the FRB to determine by regulation what other activities are financial in nature, or incidental or complementary thereto. FNCB has not elected to be treated as a financial holding company.
 
FNCB also is subject to the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
 
FNCB’s shares of common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on March 5, 2018. Accordingly, FNCB is now subject to certain financial, liquidity and corporate governance requirements imposed by Nasdaq. Non-compliance of these requirements could subject FNCB to potential denial of listing, or additional conditions, as necessary, to protect investors and the public interest. Prior to March 5, 2018, FNCB’s shares of common stock traded on the OTCQX marketplace under the symbol “FNCB”.
 
The Bank
 
Effective June 30, 2016, upon its conversion to a state charter, the Bank is regulated by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (“PADOBS”). The Bank’s deposit accounts are insured up to the maximum legal limit by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC and accordingly, the Bank is also regulated by the FDIC. The regulations of the PADOBS and the FDIC govern most aspects of the Bank’s business, including required reserves against deposits, loans, investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowings, dividends and location and number of branch offices. The laws and regulations governing the Bank generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund, and not to protect shareholders.
 
 6


Branching and Interstate Banking. The federal banking agencies are generally authorized to approve interstate bank merger transactions 
 
The Dodd-Frank Act amended federal banking law to permit banks to establish de novo branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be so permitted.  The interstate banking and branching provisions of the t federal banking laws would permit the Bank to merge with banks in other states and branch into other states and would also permit banks from other states to acquire banks in the Bank's market area and to establish de novo branches in the Bank’s market area.
 
USA Patriot Act and the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”). Under the BSA, a financial institution is required to have systems in place to detect certain transactions, based on the size and nature of the transaction. Financial institutions are generally required to report cash transactions involving more than $10,000 to the United States Treasury. In addition, financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for transactions that involve more than $5,000 and that the financial institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect, involves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the BSA or has no lawful purpose. Under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, commonly referred to as the “USA Patriot Act” or the “Patriot Act,” financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence standards intended to detect, and prevent, the use of the United States financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Patriot Act requires financial institutions, including banks, to establish anti-money laundering programs, including employee training and independent audit requirements, meet minimum specified standards, follow minimum standards for customer identification and maintenance of customer identification records, and regularly compare customer lists against lists of suspected terrorists, terrorist organizations and money launderers. 
 
Capital Adequacy Requirements. Federal banking agencies have adopted risk based capital adequacy and leverage capital adequacy requirements pursuant to which they assess the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising banks and bank holding companies and in analyzing bank regulatory applications. Risk-based capital requirements determine the adequacy of capital based on the risk inherent in various classes of assets and off-balance sheet items.
 
FNCB and the Bank are subject to extensive and detailed capital requirements, as modified by and changes imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act (“Basel III”). Basel III calls for the following capital requirements: 
 

● | A minimum ratio of common equity tier I (“CET I”) capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A minimum ratio of tier I capital to risk-weighted assets of 6%. 


● | A minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------
● | A minimum leverage ratio of 4%. 

 
Basel III also establishes a “countercyclical capital buffer,” that is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Generally, the capital conservation buffer of 2.50% of risk-weighted assets will be imposed when federal banking regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk. For all banking institutions, the phase-in period for the capital conservation buffer requirement began on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and increased by that amount each year until it reached the full 2.50% on January 1, 2019.
 
Banking institutions with a ratio of CET I to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) may face constraints on their ability to pay dividends, to effect equity repurchases and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers, which constraints vary based on the amount of the shortfall.
 
Basel III also included, as part of the definition of CET I capital, a requirement that banking institutions include the amount of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), which primarily consists of unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale securities, that are not other than temporarily impaired (“OTTI”) in calculating regulatory capital, unless the institution makes a one-time opt-out election from this provision in connection with the filing of its first regulatory reports after applicability of the Basel III Rule to that institution. The Basel III Rule also imposes a 4.00% minimum Tier I leverage ratio. FNCB and the Bank elected to exclude AOCI in calculating regulatory capital. 
 
 7


Basel III provides for new deductions from and adjustments to CET I. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET I to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10.00% of CET I or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15.00% of CET I.
 
Basel III imposed changes to methodologies for determining risk weighted assets, including revisions to recognition of credit risk mitigation, such as a greater recognition of financial collateral and a wider range of eligible guarantors, the risk weighting of equity exposures and past due loans, and higher (greater than 100%) risk weighting for certain commercial real estate exposures that have higher credit risk profiles, including higher loan to value and equity components.
 
As discussed below, Basel III also integrates the new capital requirements into the prompt corrective action provisions under Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”).
 
Prompt Corrective Action. Under Section 38 of the FDIA, each federal banking agency is required to implement a system of prompt corrective action for institutions which it regulates. The federal banking agencies have promulgated substantially similar regulations to implement the system of prompt corrective action established by Section 38 of the FDIA. 
 
The following are the capital requirements under the Basel III Rules integrated into the prompt corrective action category definitions. As of December 31, 2018, the following capital requirements were applicable to the Bank for purposes of Section 38 of the FDIA.
 


 | Total | Tier I | | | 
------------------------------------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+----------+----------------
 | Risk-Based | Risk-Based | CET I | Leverage | Tangible Equity
Capital Category | Capital Ratio | Capital Ratio | Capital Ratio | Ratio | to Assets 
Well capitalized | >/= 10.0% | >/= 8.0% | >/= 6.5% | >/= 5.0% | N/A 
Adequately capitalized with conservation buffer | >/= 9.875% | >/= 7.875% | >/= 6.375% | >/= 4.0% | N/A 
Adequately capitalized | >/= 8.0% | >/= 6.0% | >/= 4.5% | >/= 4.0% | N/A 
Undercapitalized | < 8.0% | < 6.0% | < 4.5% | < 4.0% | N/A 
Significantly undercapitalized | < 6.0% | < 4.0% | < 3.0% | < 3.0% | N/A 
Critically undercapitalized | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | Less than 2.0% 

 
Additionally, FNCB’s outstanding subordinated notes are subject to phase out and will cease to qualify as capital for regulatory purposes. Overall, management believes that implementation of Basel III did not have a material adverse effect on FNCB’s or the Bank’s capital ratios, earnings, shareholder’s equity, or its ability to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. At December 31, 2018, the Bank was “well capitalized” under the aforementioned requirements with a common equity Tier I capital and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets ratios of 11.11%, a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 12.17% and a Leverage ratio of 8.27%. Similarly, at December 31, 2018, FNCB met its capital requirements with a common equity Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets of 11.42%, a Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.47%, a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 12.69%, and a Leverage ratio of 8.50%. 
 
Regulatory Enforcement Authority. Federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities.
 
The Bank and its “institution-affiliated parties,” including its management, employees, agents, independent contractors, consultants such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the financial institution’s affairs, are subject to potential civil and criminal penalties for violations of law, regulations or written orders of a governmental agency. In addition, regulators are provided with greater flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution-affiliated parties. Possible enforcement actions include the termination of deposit insurance and cease-and-desist orders. Such orders may, among other things, require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice, including restitution, reimbursement, indemnifications or guarantees against loss. A financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth, dispose of certain assets, rescind agreements or contracts, or take other actions as determined by the ordering agency to be appropriate.

Under provisions of the federal securities laws, a determination by a court or regulatory agency that certain violations have occurred at a company or its affiliates can result in fines, restitution, a limitation of permitted activities, disqualification to continue to conduct certain activities and an inability to rely on certain favorable exemptions. Certain types of infractions and violations can also affect a public company in its timing and ability to expeditiously issue new securities into the capital markets.
 
The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss allowances for regulatory purposes.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act made significant changes to the bank regulatory structure and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. To date, the following provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are considered to be of the greatest significance to FNCB:
 

● | expands the authority of the FRB to examine bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, including insured depository institutions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | requires a bank holding company to be well capitalized and well managed to receive approval of an interstate bank acquisition;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | provides mortgage reform provisions regarding a customer’s ability to pay and making more loans subject to provisions for higher-cost loans and new disclosures;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | creates the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) that has rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and has broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | creates the Financial Stability Oversight Council with authority to identify institutions and practices that might pose a systemic risk;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | introduces additional corporate governance and executive compensation requirements on companies’ subject to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | permits FDIC-insured banks to pay interest on business demand deposits;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | requires that holding companies and other companies that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution serve as a source of financial strength;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | makes permanent the $250 thousand limit for federal deposit insurance at all insured depository institutions; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | permits national and state banks to establish interstate branches to the same extent as the branch host state allows establishment of in-state branches.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”), Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”), Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB, but continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrower’s ability to repay. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a “qualified mortgage” as defined by the CFPB. The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. 
 
Ability to Repay and Qualified Mortgage Rule 
 
Pursuant to the Dodd Frank in 2014 the CFPB amended Regulation Z as implemented by the Truth in Lending Act, requiring mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Mortgage lenders are required to determine consumers’ ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision: 

• | current or reasonably expected income or assets;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | current employment status;
--+---------------------------


• | the monthly payment on the covered transaction;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | the monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | current debt obligations, alimony, and child support;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | the monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | credit history.
--+----------------

 
Alternatively, the mortgage lender can originate “qualified mortgages,” which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a “qualified mortgage” is a mortgage loan without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage, the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount. Loans which meet these criteria will be considered qualified mortgages, and as a result generally protect lenders from fines or litigation in the event of foreclosure. Qualified mortgages that are “higher-priced” (e.g. subprime loans) garner a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay rules, while qualified mortgages that are not “higher-priced” (e.g. prime loans) are given a safe harbor of compliance. The rule did not have a material impact on our lending activities or our results of operations or financial condition.
 
TILA/RESPA Integrated Disclosures (“TRID”).  In 2015, the CFPB implemented a rule combining the mortgage disclosures consumers previously received under TILA and RESPA. For more than 30 years, the TILA and RESPA mortgage disclosures had been administered separately by, respectively, the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The rule requires lenders to provide applicants with the new Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure and generally applies to most closed-end consumer mortgage loans. 
 
The CFPB’s rulemaking, examination and enforcement authority has and will continue to significantly affect financial institutions offering consumer financial products and services, including FNCB and the Bank. These regulatory activities may limit the types of financial services and products the Bank may offer, which in turn may reduce FNCB’s revenues.
 
FDIC Insurance Premiums. The FDIC maintains a risk-based assessment system for determining deposit insurance premiums. Four risk categories (I-IV), each subject to different premium rates, are established based upon an institution’s status as well capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized, and the institution’s supervisory rating. 
 
The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum deposit insurance amount for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on a financial institution’s average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to increase the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits by 2020 and eliminates the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to insured depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the statutory prohibition against the payment of interest on business checking accounts.
 
An insured institution is required to pay deposit insurance premiums on its assessment base in accordance with its risk category. There are three adjustments that can be made to an institution’s initial base assessment rate: (1) a potential decrease for long-term unsecured debt, including senior and subordinated debt and, for small institutions, a portion of Tier I capital; (2) a potential increase for secured liabilities above a threshold amount; and (3) for non-Risk Category I institutions, a potential increase for brokered deposits above a threshold amount. The FDIC may also impose special assessments from time to time. 
 
At December 31, 2018, the Bank was considered risk category I, the lowest risk category, for deposit insurance assessments and paid an annual assessment rate ranging from 0.0005 basis points to 0.0006 basis points on the assessment base of average consolidated total assets less the average tangible equity during the assessment period.

May 2018 Banking Reform Legislation
 
On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Regulatory Relief Act”), amended certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as well as certain other statutes administered by the federal banking agencies.  Some of the key provisions of the Regulatory Relief Act as it relates to community banks and bank holding companies include: (i) designating mortgages held in portfolio as “qualified mortgages” for banks with less than $10 billion in assets, subject to certain documentation and product limitations; (ii) exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets (and total trading assets and trading liabilities of 5% or less of total assets) from Volcker Rule requirements relating to proprietary trading; (iii) simplifying capital calculations for banks with less than $10 billion in assets by requiring federal banking agencies to establish a community bank leverage ratio of tangible equity to average consolidated assets of not less than 8% or more than 10%, and provide that banks that maintain tangible equity in excess of such ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with risk-based capital and leverage requirements; (iv) assisting smaller banks with obtaining stable funding by providing an exception for reciprocal deposits from FDIC restrictions on acceptance of brokered deposits; (v) raising the eligibility for use of short-form Call Reports from $1 billion to $5 billion in assets; (vi) clarifying definitions pertaining to high volatility commercial real estate loans (HVCRE), which require higher capital allocations, so that only loans with increased risk are subject to higher risk weightings; and (vii) changing the eligibility for use of the small bank holding company policy statement from institutions with under $1 billion in assets to institutions with under $3 billion in assets. 
 
Section 201 of the Regulatory Relief Act directed the federal banking agencies to develop a community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) of not less than 8% and not more than 10% for qualifying community banks and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion.  Qualifying community banking organizations that exceed the CBLR level established by the agencies, and that elect to be covered by the CBLR framework, will be considered to have met:  (i) the generally applicable leverage and risk-based capital requirements under the banking agencies’ capital rules; (ii) the capital ratio requirements necessary to be considered “well capitalized” under the banking agencies’ prompt corrective action framework in the case of insured depository institutions; and (iii) any other applicable capital or leverage requirements. 
 
On February 8, 2019, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board, and the FDIC published for comment a proposed rule to implement the provisions of Section 201 of the Regulatory Relief Act.  Under the proposal, a qualifying community banking organization would be defined as a depository institution or depository institution holding company with less than $10 billion in assets and specified limited amounts of off-balance sheet exposures, trading assets and liabilities, mortgage servicing assets, and certain temporary difference deferred tax assets.  A qualifying community banking organization would be permitted to elect the CBLR framework if its CBLR is greater than 9%.  The proposed rulemaking also addresses opting in and opting out of the CBLR framework by a community banking organization, the treatment of a community banking organization that falls below CBLR requirements, and the effect of various CBLR levels for purposes of the prompt corrective action categories applicable to insured depository institutions.  Advanced approaches banking organizations (generally, institutions with $250 billion or more in consolidated assets) are not eligible to use the CBLR framework.
 
FNCB continues to analyze the changes implemented by the Regulatory Relief Act, including the CBLR framework included in the recently proposed rulemaking.  FNCB has not determined at this time whether or not it would qualify for the CBLR framework or, if so, whether it would elect to utilize the CBLR framework.  FNCB does not believe, however, that the changes resulting from the Regulatory Relief Act will materially impact FNCB’s business, operations, or financial results.
 
Dividend Restrictions
 
FNCB is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. FNCB ’s revenues (on a parent company only basis) and its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders are almost entirely dependent upon the receipt of dividends from the Bank. The right of FNCB , and consequently the rights of its creditors and shareholders to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary through the payment of such dividends or otherwise is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of the subsidiary (including depositors) except to the extent that claims of FNCB , in its capacity as a creditor, may be recognized. Additionally, the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to FNCB is subject to Pennsylvania state law and various regulatory restrictions. 
 
The declaration of cash dividends on FNCB’s common stock is at the discretion of its board of directors, and any decision to declare a dividend is based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, earnings, prospects, financial condition, regulatory capital levels, applicable covenants under any credit agreements, notes and other contractual restrictions, Pennsylvania law, federal bank regulatory law, and other factors deemed relevant.

As of December 31, 2018, FNCB, including the Bank employed 239 persons, including 27 part-time employees.
