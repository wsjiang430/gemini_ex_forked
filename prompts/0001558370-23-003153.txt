Item 1. Business
W&T Offshore, Inc. is an independent oil and natural gas producer, active in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico. W&T Offshore, Inc. is a Texas corporation originally organized as a Nevada corporation in 1988, and successor by merger to W&T Oil Properties, Inc., a Louisiana corporation organized in 1983.
Since our founding in 1983 by our Chairman and CEO, Tracy Krohn, we have continually grown our footprint in the Gulf of Mexico through acquisitions, exploration and development. As of December 31, 2022 we held working interests in 47 offshore producing fields in federal and state waters. Our acreage, well, production and reserves information is described in more detail under Part I Item 2, Properties, in this Form 10-K. Our working interests in fields, leases, structures and equipment are primarily owned by W&T Offshore, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Aquasition LLC (“A-I LLC”), Aquasition II LLC (“A-II LLC”), and W&T Energy VI, LLC, Delaware limited liability companies and through our proportionately consolidated interest in Monza Energy, LLC (“Monza”). 
For the past four decades, we have developed significant technical expertise in finding and developing properties in the Gulf of Mexico with existing production which provide the best opportunity to achieve a rapid return on our invested capital. We have successfully discovered and produced properties on the conventional shelf and in the deepwater across the Gulf of Mexico. 
Business Strategy
The Gulf of Mexico offers unique advantages, and we are uniquely positioned to create value with a diverse portfolio in valuable shelf, deep shelf and deepwater projects. Our diverse portfolio of operations in the Gulf of Mexico enables stacked pay development, attractive primary production, and recompletion opportunities. At W&T Offshore, we use advanced seismic and geoscience tools to execute successful drilling projects.
In managing our business, we are focused on optimizing production and increasing reserves in a profitable and prudent manner, while managing cash flows to meet our obligations and investment needs. Our goal is to pursue lower risk, high rate of return projects and develop oil and natural gas resources that allow us to grow our production, reserves and cash flow in a capital efficient manner, and organically enhance the value of our assets helping to ensure the long-term sustainability of our business. 
We follow a proven and consistent business strategy:

● | Focus on Free Cash Flow generation. Our strong production base and cost optimization has generated steady free cash flows. The Gulf of Mexico is an area where we have developed significant technical expertise and where high production rates associated with hydrocarbon deposits have historically provided us the best opportunity to achieve high rates of return on our invested capital particularly as we focus on optimizing costs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maintain high quality conventional asset base with low decline. We generate incremental production from probable reserves and possible reserves due to natural drive mechanisms. Typical fields with high-quality sands offer mechanisms superior to primary depletion and they often enjoy incremental reserve adds annually. Fewer conventional wells are required to develop these fields. While we continue to utilize proven techniques and technologies, we will also continuously seek efficiencies in our drilling, completion and production techniques in order to optimize ultimate resource recoveries, rates of return and cash flows.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Capitalize on unique and accretive acquisition opportunities. We strategically pursue the acquisition of compelling producing assets that generate cash flows at attractive valuations with upside potential and optimization opportunities. We may also use our capital flexibility to pursue value-enhancing, bolt-on acquisitions to opportunistically improve our positions in existing assets.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Reduce costs to improve margins. At W&T, we grow in opportunistic ways as we manage our balance sheet prudently and reinvest free cash flow. Our existing portfolio of 154 structures (116 of which we operate) provides a key advantage when evaluating and developing prospect opportunities and serves to reduce capital expenditures and maximize our returns on capital expenditures.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Preserve ample liquidity and maintain financial flexibility. By operating within our free cash flow, we are able to reduce debt, thus optimizing the balance sheet and maintaining financial flexibility. We also intend to use a portion of the free cash flow we generate to reduce our outstanding debt to maintain flexibility for future opportunities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Management of environmental, social, and governance matters. With ultimate oversight by our Board of Directors, Environmental, Social & Governance (“ESG”) matters are an integral part of our day-to-day operations and are incorporated into the strategic decision-making process across our business. We have established a managerial ESG Task Force composed of cross-functional management-level employees in Operations, HSE&R, Legal, Human Resources, Investor Relations, and Finance. This task force is responsible for overseeing and managing our ESG reporting initiatives and suggesting areas of focus to our executive management. Executive management in turn reports on those activities to the Board of Directors. We strive to execute our business plan while simultaneously reducing our environmental footprint, including emissions, potential spills and other impacts. With respect to social priorities, we maintain a company-wide diversity training program and focus on promoting diversity and inclusion. Relating to governance, our fundamental policy is to conduct our business with honesty and integrity in accordance with high legal and ethical standards. In 2022, we published our second annual ESG report highlighting our performance and initiatives across ESG categories for the period of 2019 to 2021, which is not incorporated into, and does not form a part of, this Form 10-K. Finally, ESG performance scores are a factor in determining compensation for all management-level employees.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We intend to execute the following elements of our business strategy in order to achieve our strategic goals:

● | Exploiting existing and acquired properties to add additional reserves and production;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exploring for reserves on our extensive acreage holdings and in other areas of the Gulf of Mexico;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Acquiring reserves with substantial upside potential and additional leasehold acreage complementary to our existing acreage position at attractive prices;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continuing to manage our balance sheet in a prudent manner and continuing our track record of financial flexibility in any commodity price environment; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Carry out our business strategy in a safe and socially responsible manner.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We continually monitor current and forecasted commodity prices to assess if changes are needed to our plans. Our significant inside ownership ensures that executive management’s interests are highly aligned with those of our shareholders, thus incentivizing executive management to maximize value and mitigate risk in executing our business strategy, generating shareholder value.

Competition
The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We also face increasing indirect competition from alternative energy sources, including wind, solar, and electric power. We currently operate in the Gulf of Mexico and compete for the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties and lease sales primarily on the basis of price for such properties. We compete with numerous entities, including major domestic and foreign oil companies, other independent oil and natural gas companies and individual producers and operators. Many of these competitors are large, well established companies that have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours and greater ability to provide the extensive regulatory financial assurances required for offshore properties. Our ability to acquire additional oil and natural gas properties, acquire additional leases and to discover reserves in the future will depend upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties, finance investments and consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment.
Oil and Natural Gas Marketing and Delivery Commitments
We sell our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas to third-party customers. We are not dependent upon, or contractually limited to, any one customer or small group of customers. In 2022, approximately 31% of our revenues were received from BP Products North America and approximately 13% from Chevron-Texaco, with no other customer comprising greater than 10% of our 2022 revenues. Given the commoditized nature of the products we produce and market and the location of our production in the Gulf of Mexico, we believe the loss of any of the customers above would not result in a material adverse effect on our ability to market future oil and natural gas, provided that replacement customers could be obtained in a relatively short period of time on terms, conditions, and pricing substantially similar to those currently existing. We do not have any agreements which obligate us to deliver a fixed volume of physical products to customers.
Compliance with Government Regulations
Various aspects of our oil and natural gas operations are subject to extensive and continually changing regulations as legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue, and have issued, rules and regulations binding upon the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members. BOEM and BSEE, both agencies under the U.S. Department of the Interior (“DOI”), have adopted regulations pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (“OCSLA”) that apply to our operations on federal leases in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. In 1989, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, which removed all remaining price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas, effective January 1, 1993. Sales by producers of natural gas and all sales of crude oil, condensate and NGLs can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices. The FERC also regulates rates and service conditions for the interstate transportation of liquids, including crude oil, condensate and NGLs, under various statutes.
The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the FERC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) hold statutory authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities markets. These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets. We are required to observe the market related regulations enforced by these agencies with regard to our physical sales of crude oil or other energy commodities, and any related hedging activities that we undertake. Any violation of the FTC, FERC, and CFTC prohibitions on market manipulation can result in substantial civil penalties amounting to almost $1.5 million per violation per day.
These departments and agencies have substantial enforcement authority and the ability to grant and suspend operations, and to levy substantial penalties for non-compliance. Failure to comply with such regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Federal leases. Most of our offshore operations are conducted on federal oil and natural gas leases in the OCS waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The DOI has delegated its authority to issue federal leases granted under the OCSLA to the BOEM, which has adopted and implemented regulations relating to the issuance and operation of oil and natural gas leases on the OCS. These leases are awarded by the BOEM based on competitive bidding and contain relatively standardized terms. These leases require compliance with the BOEM, the BSEE, and other government agency regulations and orders that are subject to interpretation and change. The BSEE also regulates the plugging and abandonment of wells located on the OCS and, following cessation of operations, the removal or appropriate abandonment of all production facilities, structures and pipelines on the OCS (collectively, these activities are referred to as “decommissioning”), while the BOEM governs financial assurance requirements associated with those decommissioning obligations.
President Biden has made tackling climate change, including the restriction or elimination of future greenhouse gas (“GHGs”) emissions, a priority in his administration. The Biden Administration has already adopted several executive orders and is expected to pursue additional orders and pursue legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives in support of this regulatory agenda. Notably, President Biden issued an executive order in January 2021 suspending new leasing activities for oil and gas exploration and production on federal lands and offshore waters pending review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. The suspension of these federal leasing activities prompted legal action by several states against the Biden Administration, resulting in issuance of a nationwide preliminary injunction by a federal district court in June 2021, effectively halting implementation of the leasing suspension. Subsequent federal litigation, however has impeded the most recent federal oil and gas lease sale (Lease Sale 257) in the Gulf of Mexico requiring the DOI to conduct a new environmental analysis that takes into consideration such climate effects before holding another sale. In August 2022, the Fifth Circuit vacated the injunction blocking the leasing moratorium, allowing the Biden Administration to continue implementing the pause. However, in compliance with the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the BOEM reinstated Lease Sale 257 in September 2022. The BOEM has continued to plan for upcoming offshore lease sales as required by the OCSLA. In July 2022, the BOEM published the 2023-2028 National Outer Continental Shelf Drilling and Leasing Proposed Program, which contemplates eleven future lease sales. In November 2021, the DOI released its report on federal oil and gas leasing and permitting practices. The report includes recommendations in respect to offshore sector, including adjusting royalty rates to ensure that the full value of the tracts being leased are captured, strengthening financial assurance coverage amounts that are required by operators, establishing a “fitness to operate” criteria that companies would need to meet in respect of safety, environmental and financial responsibilities in order to operate on the OCS. Several of the report recommendations require action by the Congress and cannot be implemented unilaterally by the Biden Administration; however, in April 2022, the DOI published sale notices for June 2022 onshore lease sales that incorporated certain recommendations in the DOI’s report, including significantly reduced acreage of land available for leasing on public lands and an increased royalty rate of 18.75%, up from the current rates of 12.50% to 16.67%. We continue to conduct our operations on our existing leases in the OCS; however, uncertainty on future Biden Administration actions with regard to offshore oil and gas activities on the OCS together with the issuance of any future executive orders or adoption and implementation of laws, rules or initiatives that further restrict, delay or result in cancellation of existing oil and gas activities on the OCS could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.
Decommissioning and financial assurance requirements. The BOEM requires that lessees demonstrate financial strength and reliability according to its regulations and provide acceptable financial assurances to assure satisfaction of lease obligations, including decommissioning activities on the OCS. In 2016, the BOEM under the Obama Administration issued Notice to Lessees and Operators 2016-N01 (the “2016 NTL”) to clarify the procedures and guidelines that BOEM Regional Directors use to determine if and when additional financial assurances may be required for OCS leases, rights of way (“ROWs”) and rights of use and easement (“RUEs”). The 2016 NTL was not fully implemented as the BOEM under the Trump Administration rescinded the 2016 NTL in 2020. In October 2020, BOEM published jointly with BSEE a proposed rule that sought to clarify and provide greater transparency to decommissioning and related financial assurance requirements imposed on record title owners and operating rights owners of interests in federal OCS leases and RUE and ROW grant holders conducting operations on the federal OCS. A final rule was expected by December 2022 but has not yet been published. In August 2021, the BOEM announced expanded requirements for supplemental financial assurance for properties with property owners who are not deemed to be financially strong by the BOEM. In addition to sole liability properties where the owner is not financially strong, the BOEM will require supplemental financial assurance for certain high-risk, non-sole liability properties.

Consistent with the November 2021 DOI leasing report recommendations and in response to President Biden’s January 2021 executive order, the Biden Administration could pursue more stringent decommissioning and financial assurance requirements that could increase our operating costs. According to the federal government’s Fall 2022 Unified Regulatory Agenda, the BOEM and the BSEE are expected to finalize the policies and procedures concerning compliance with OCS oil and gas decommissioning obligations originally proposed under the Trump Administration. In addition, BOEM is expected to propose a new rule in respect of financial assurance requirements to ensure compliance with OCS obligations. The BOEM has the authority to issue liability orders in the future, including if it determines there is a substantial risk of nonperformance of the interest holder’s decommissioning liabilities.
 Reporting of decommissioning expenditures. Under applicable BSEE regulations, lessees operating on the OCS and conducting decommissioning activities are required to submit summaries of actual expenditures for decommissioning of subject wells, platforms, and other facilities. The BSEE has reported that it uses this summary information to better estimate future decommissioning liabilities. See Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for more discussion on decommissioning and financial assurance requirements.
Regulation and transportation of natural gas. Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive regulation. The FERC has undertaken various initiatives to increase competition within the natural gas industry. As a result of initiatives like FERC Order No. 636, issued in 1992, the interstate natural gas transportation and marketing system allows non-pipeline natural gas sellers, including producers, to effectively compete with interstate pipelines for sales to local distribution companies and large industrial and commercial customers. The most significant provisions of Order No. 636 require that interstate pipelines provide firm and interruptible transportation service on an open access basis that is equal for all natural gas supplies. In many instances, the effect of Order No. 636 and related initiatives have been to substantially reduce or eliminate the interstate pipelines’ traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas in favor of providing only storage and transportation services. The rates for such storage and transportation services are subject to FERC ratemaking authority, and FERC may apply cost-of-service principles or allow a pipeline to negotiate rates. Similarly, the natural gas pipeline industry is subject to state regulations, which may change from time to time.
The OCSLA, which is administered by the BOEM and the FERC, requires that all pipelines operating on or across the OCS provide open access, non-discriminatory transportation service. One of the FERC’s principal goals in carrying out OCSLA’s mandate is to increase transparency in the OCS market, to provide producers and shippers assurance of open access service on pipelines located on the OCS, and to provide non-discriminatory rates and conditions of service on such pipelines. The BOEM issued a final rule, effective August 2008, which implements a hotline, alternative dispute resolution procedures, and complaint procedures for resolving claims of having been denied open and nondiscriminatory access to pipelines on the OCS.
In 2007, the FERC issued rules (“Order 704”) requiring that any market participant, including a producer such as us, that engages in wholesale sales or purchases of natural gas that equal or exceed 2.2 million MMBtus during a calendar year must annually report such sales and purchases to the FERC to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704. Order 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers, and if so, whether their reporting complies with FERC’s policy statement on price reporting. These rules are intended to increase the transparency of the wholesale natural gas markets and to assist the FERC in monitoring such markets and in detecting market manipulation.
Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, the FERC, state legislatures, state commissions and the courts. The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated. As a result, there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach pursued by the FERC, Congress and the states will continue. 

5



While these federal and state regulations for the most part affect us only indirectly, they are intended to enhance competition in natural gas markets. We cannot predict what further action the FERC, the BOEM or state regulators will take on these matters. However, we do not believe that any such action taken will affect us differently, in any material way, than other natural gas producers with which we compete.
Oil and NGLs transportation rates. Other than as described above, our sales of liquids, which include crude oil, condensate and NGLs, are not currently regulated and are transacted at market prices. In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction. The price we receive from the sale of crude oil and NGLs is affected by the cost of transporting those products to market. Interstate transportation rates for crude oil, condensate, NGLs and other products are regulated by the FERC. In general, interstate crude oil, condensate and NGL pipeline rates must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. The FERC has established an indexing system for such transportation, which generally allows such pipelines to take an annual inflation-based rate increase.
In other instances, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to regulation by state regulatory bodies under state statutes and regulations. As it relates to intrastate crude oil, condensate and NGL pipelines, state regulation is generally less rigorous than the federal regulation of interstate pipelines. State agencies have generally not investigated or challenged existing or proposed rates in the absence of shipper complaints or protests, which are infrequent and are usually resolved informally. We do not believe that the regulatory decisions or activities relating to interstate or intrastate crude oil, condensate or NGL pipelines will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they affect other crude oil, condensate and NGL producers or marketers.
Regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production. Our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Such regulations include requiring permits, bonds and pollution liability insurance for the drilling of wells, regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling, casing, operating, plugging and abandoning wells, and governing the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled. Many states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation of oil and gas resources, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells and the regulation of spacing of such wells.
Tropical storms, hurricanes and other weather events in the Gulf of Mexico can have a significant impact on oil and gas operations on the OCS. The effects from past tropical storms and hurricanes have included structural damage to fixed production facilities, semi-submersibles and jack-up drilling rigs. Damage can occur both above the water line and to subsea infrastructure. The BOEM and the BSEE continue to be concerned about the loss of these facilities and rigs as well as the potential for catastrophic damage to key infrastructure and the resultant pollution from future storms. In an effort to reduce the potential for future damage, the BOEM and the BSEE have periodically issued guidance aimed at improving platform survivability by taking into account environmental and oceanic conditions in the design of platforms and related structures.

Compliance with Environmental Regulations
General. We are subject to complex and stringent federal, state and local environmental laws. These laws, among other things, govern the issuance of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations, the amounts and types of materials that may be released into the environment and the discharge and disposal of waste materials and, to the extent waste materials are transported and disposed of in onshore facilities, remediation of any releases of those waste materials from such facilities. Numerous governmental agencies issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws, which are often costly to comply with, and a failure to comply may result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures, the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, or development or expansion of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas. Certain environmental laws, such as the federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (“OPA”) impose strict joint and several liability for environmental contamination, such as may arise in the event of an accidental spill on the OCS, rendering a person liable for environmental damage and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability. The cost of remediation, reclamation and decommissioning, including abandonment of wells, platforms and other facilities in the Gulf of Mexico is significant. These costs are considered a normal, recurring cost of our on-going operations. Our competitors are subject to the same laws and regulations.
Hazardous Substances and Wastes. The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, (“CERCLA”) imposes liability, without regard to fault, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. Under CERCLA, such persons are subject to strict joint and several liability for the cost of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the cost of certain health studies.
The federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”), regulates the generation, transportation, storage, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes and can require cleanup of hazardous waste disposal sites. RCRA currently excludes drilling fluids, produced waters and certain other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas from regulation as “hazardous waste”, and the disposal of such oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes is regulated under less onerous non-hazardous waste requirements, usually under state law.
Standards have been developed under RCRA and/or state laws for worker protection from exposure to Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (“NORM”), treatment, storage, and disposal of NORM and NORM waste, and management of NORM-contaminated piping valves, containers and tanks. Historically, we have not incurred any material expenditures in connection with our compliance with the existing RCRA and applicable state laws related to NORM waste.
Air Emissions and Climate Change. Air emissions from our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, as amended (“CAA”), and comparable state and local requirements. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions. For example, in 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ground level ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion. Since that time, the EPA issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone and, in December 2020, published notice of a final action to retain the 2015 ozone NAAQS without revision on a going-forward basis. However, the EPA is currently re-writing a draft policy assessment that is a key component of the agency’s reconsideration of the 2015 NAAQS for ozone, raising the possibility that the EPA may tighten the standards in the future. The EPA is expected to issue a proposed rule in April 2023 and a final rule by the end of 2023.

The threat of climate change continues to attract considerable public, governmental and scientific attention in the United States and in foreign countries. As a result, numerous proposals have been made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHG as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, policies and incentives to encourage the use of renewable energy or alternative low-carbon fuels and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. Furthermore, many state and local leaders have intensified or stated their intent to intensify efforts to support international climate commitments and treaties. In the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. However, such legislation has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress and may be proposed or adopted in the future. Further, the EPA has adopted regulations under the existing CAA that, among other things, impose preconstruction and operating permit requirements on certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources, and implement New Source Performance Standards directing the reduction of methane emissions from certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector. In November 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule intended to reduce methane emissions from new and existing crude oil and natural gas sources. The proposed rule would make the existing regulations in Subpart OOOOa more stringent and create a Subpart OOOOb to expand reduction requirements for new, modified, and reconstructed oil and gas sources, including standards focusing on certain source types that have never been regulated under the CAA (including intermittent vent pneumatic controllers, associated gas, and liquids unloading facilities). In addition, the proposed rule would establish “Emissions Guidelines,” creating a Subpart OOOOc that would require states to develop plans to reduce methane emissions from existing sources that must be at least as effective as presumptive standards set by the EPA. In November 2022, the EPA issued a proposed rule supplementing the November 2021 proposed rule. Among other things, the November 2022 supplemental proposed rule removes an emissions monitoring exemption for small wellhead-only sites and creates a new third-party monitoring program to flag large emissions events, referred to in the proposed rule as “super emitters”. According to the Fall 2022 Unified Regulatory Agenda, the EPA is expected to issue a final rule by August 2023. Additionally, in August 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, includes a methane emissions reduction program. The implementation of revised air emission standards could result in stricter permitting requirements, which could delay, limit or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits and result in increased compliance costs on our operations, including expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.
Additionally, on March 21, 2022, the SEC issued a proposed rule regarding the enhancement and standardization of mandatory climate-related disclosures. The proposed rule would require registrants to include certain climate-related disclosures in their registration statements and periodic reports, including, but not limited to, information about the registrant’s governance of climate-related risks and relevant risk management processes; climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition and their actual and likely climate-related impacts on the registrant’s business strategy, model, and outlook; climate-related targets, goals and transition plan (if any); certain climate-related financial statement metrics in a note to their audited financial statements; Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions; and Scope 3 GHG emissions and intensity, if material, or if the registrant has set a GHG emissions reduction target, goal or plan that includes Scope 3 GHG emissions. Although the proposed rule’s ultimate date of effectiveness and the final form and substance of these requirements is not yet known and the ultimate scope and impact on our business is uncertain, compliance with the proposed rule, if finalized, may result in increased legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and place strain on our personnel, systems and resources.

At the international level, there exists numerous conventions and non-binding commitments of participating nations with goals of limiting their GHG emissions and fossil fuel subsidies. These include the United Nations-sponsored Paris Agreement, which requires signatory countries to set voluntary, individually-determined reduction goals, known as Nationally Determined Contributions, every five years after 2020 to reduce domestic GHG emissions. Although the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement, President Biden recommitted the United States to the Paris Agreement in April 2021. Pursuant to its obligations as a signatory to the Paris Agreement in November 2020, the United States has set a target to reduce its GHG emissions by 50-52% by the year 2030 as compared with 2005 levels and has agreed to provide periodic updates on its progress. Additionally, at the 26th Conference of the Parties (“COP26”) in November 2021, the United States and European Union jointly announced the Global Methane Pledge, an initiative committing to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030, including “all feasible reductions” in the energy sector. COP26 concluded with the finalization of the Glasgow Climate Pact, which stated long-term global goals (including those in the Paris Agreement) to limit the increase in the global average temperature and emphasized reductions in GHG emissions. Most recently, at the 27th Conference of the Parties (“COP27”), President Biden announced the EPA’s proposed standards to reduce methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources, and agreed, in conjunction with the European Union and a number of other partner countries, to develop standards for monitoring and reporting methane emissions to help create a market for low methane-intensity natural gas. Various state and local governments have also publicly committed to furthering the goals of the Paris Agreement. The impacts of these orders, pledges, agreements and any legislation or regulation promulgated to fulfill the United States’ commitments under the Paris Agreement, COP26, or other international conventions cannot be predicted at this time.
The OCSLA authorized the DOI to regulate activities authorized by the BOEM in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico. The EPA retains jurisdiction over all other parts of the OCS. Under the OCSLA, the DOI is limited to regulating offshore emissions of criteria and their precursor – pollutants to the extent they significantly affect the air quality of any state. The BSEE conducts field inspections of emission sources installed on offshore platforms that have the potential to emit regulated air pollutants. The agency also reviews BOEM-mandated monitoring and reporting of air emission sources for compliance with approved plan emission limits. BSEE may initiate measures to control and bring into compliance those operations determined to be in violation of applicable regulations or plan conditions by issuing Incidents of Noncompliance (“INC”) or recommending further enforcement action against potential violators.
Water Discharges. The primary federal law for oil spill liability is the OPA which amends and augments oil spill provisions of the federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”). OPA imposes certain duties and liabilities on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening United States waters, including the OCS or adjoining shorelines. A “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge or, in the case of offshore facilities, the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging facility is located. OPA assigns strict, joint and several liability, without regard to fault, to each responsible party for all containment and oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to oil and natural resource related damages and economic damages suffered by persons adversely affected by an oil spill. Although defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA, they are limited. In January 2018, the BOEM raised OPA’s damages liability cap to approximately $137.7 million; however, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct, resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation, or if the party failed to report a spill or cooperate fully in the cleanup. OPA requires owners and operators of offshore oil production facilities to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility to cover costs that could be incurred in responding to an oil spill, and to prepare and submit for approval oil spill response plans. These oil spill response plans must detail the action to be taken in the event of a spill; identify contracted spill response equipment, materials, and trained personnel; and identify the time necessary to deploy these resources in the event of a spill. In addition, OPA currently requires a minimum financial responsibility demonstration of between $35.0 million and $150.0 million for companies operating on the OCS. We are currently required to demonstrate, on an annual basis, that we have ready access to $35.0 million that can be used to respond to an oil spill from our facilities on the OCS.

The Clean Water Act and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the monitoring and discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other natural gas wastes, into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. The treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from our onshore gas processing plant have compliance costs. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as “SPCC plans,” in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. Our Board of Directors reviews our Clean Water Act compliance metrics on a quarterly basis.
Marine Protected Areas and Endangered and Threatened Species. Executive Order 13158, issued in May 2000, directs federal agencies to safeguard existing Marine Protected Areas (“MPAs”) in the United States and establish new MPAs. The order requires federal agencies to avoid harm to MPAs to the extent permitted by law and to the maximum extent practicable. In addition, Federal Lease Stipulations include regulations regarding the taking of protected marine species (such as sea turtles, marine mammals, Gulf sturgeon and other listed marine species).
 Certain flora and fauna that have been officially classified as “threatened” or “endangered” are protected by the federal Endangered Species Act, as amended (“ESA”) and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, as amended (“MMPA”). These laws prohibit any activities that could “take” a protected plant or animal or reduce or degrade its habitat area. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”) under former President Trump issued a final rule in January 2021, which clarified that criminal liability under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (“MBTA”) would apply only to actions “directed at” migratory birds, its nests, or its eggs; however, in October 2021, the USFWS under the Biden Administration revoked the Trump Administration’s rule on incidental take and published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking to codify a general prohibition on incidental take while establishing a process to regulate or permit exceptions to such a prohibition. The final rule became effective in December 2021. Additionally, in June and July 2022, the USFWS and the National Marine Fisheries Service (“NMFS”) rescinded the Trump Administration’s definition of “habitat” for the purpose of critical habitat designation and the rule setting forth procedures for USFWS critical habitat designations. The USFWS and NMFS may make determinations on the listing of species as threatened or endangered under the ESA or MMPA and litigation with respect to the listing or non-listing of certain species may result in more fulsome protections for non-protected or lesser-protected species. We conduct operations on leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or MMPA may exist.
Other federal statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and which may apply to our operations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. These laws and related implementing regulations may require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and may limit or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands or other protected areas. Operations in such protected areas may require certain mitigation measures to avoid harm to protected species, and such laws and regulations may impose additional costs on our operations.
The leases and permits required for our various operations are subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities. Moreover, applicable leasing and permitting programs may be subject to legislative, regulatory or executive actions to delay or suspend the issuance of leases and permits. There is also increasing interest in nature-related matters beyond protected species, such as general biodiversity, which may similarly require us or our customers to incur costs or take other measures which may adversely impact our business or operations.

Insurance Coverage
Our oil and natural gas operations are subject to risks incident to the operation of oil and gas wells, including, but not limited to, uncontrolled flows of oil, gas, brine or well fluids into the environment, blowouts, cratering, mechanical difficulties, fires, explosions or other physical damage, pollution or other risks, any of which could result in substantial losses to us. In addition, our oil and natural gas properties are located in the Gulf of Mexico, which makes us more vulnerable to tropical storms and hurricanes. These hazards can cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage and the suspension of operations. Damages arising from such occurrences may result in lawsuits asserting large claims. Insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject. A successful claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Although we obtain insurance against some of these risks, we cannot insure against all possible losses. As a result, any damage or loss not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
We have insurance policies to cover some of our risk of loss associated with our operations, and we maintain the amount of insurance we believe is prudent. However, not all of our business activities can be insured at the levels we desire because of either limited market availability or unfavorable economics (limited coverage for the underlying cost). Our general and excess liability policies, among others, are effective for one year beginning May 1, 2022 and provide for $300.0 million of coverage for bodily injury and property damage liability, including coverage for liability claims resulting from seepage, pollution or contamination. With respect to the Oil Spill Financial Responsibility requirement under the OPA of 1990, we are required to evidence $35.0 million of financial responsibility to the BSEE and we have insurance coverage of such amount. We currently carry multiple layers of insurance coverage in our Energy Package (defined as certain insurance policies relating to our oil and gas properties which include named windstorm coverage) covering our operating activities, with higher limits of coverage for higher valued properties and wells. The Energy Package is effective for one year beginning June 1, 2022 and limits for well control range from $30.0 million to $500.0 million depending on the risk profile and contractual requirements. With respect to coverage for named windstorms, we have a $162.5 million aggregate limit covering one of our higher valued properties, and $150.0 million for all other properties subject to a retention of $17.5 million on the conventional shelf properties and $12.5 million on the deepwater properties. The operational and named windstorm coverages are effective for one year beginning June 1, 2022. Coverage for pollution causing a negative environmental impact is provided under the well control and other sections within the policy. We do not carry business interruption insurance.
Financial Information
We operate our business as a single segment. See Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for our financial information.
Seasonality and Inflation
Seasonality. Generally, the demand for and price of natural gas increases during the winter months and decreases during the summer months. However, these seasonal fluctuations are somewhat reduced because during the summer, pipeline companies, utilities, local distribution companies and industrial users purchase and place into storage facilities a portion of their anticipated winter requirements of natural gas. As utilities continue to switch from coal to natural gas, some of this seasonality has been reduced as natural gas is used for both heating and cooling. In addition, the demand for oil is higher in the winter months, but does not fluctuate seasonally as much as natural gas. Seasonal weather changes affect our operations. Tropical storms and hurricanes occur in the Gulf of Mexico during the summer and fall, which can require us to evacuate personnel and shut in production until a storm subsides. Also, periodic storms during the winter often impede our ability to safely load, unload and transport personnel and equipment, which can delay production and sales of our oil and natural gas.

Inflation. The United States has experienced a rise in inflation since October 2021. The annual rate of inflation in the United States was measured at 6.5% in December 2022 by the Consumer Price Index. This is down from the June 2022 peak of 9.1% and represents the smallest twelve-month increase since the period ending October 2021. While currently on the decline, the annual inflation rate remains at its highest level since the early 1980s. For 2022, our realized prices for crude oil increased 41.9%, NGLs increased 19.8% and natural gas increased 86.3% from 2021. Due to the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry, fluctuating demand for oilfield goods and services can put pressure on the pricing structure within our industry. As commodity prices rise, the cost of oilfield goods and services generally also increase, while during periods of commodity price declines, decreases in oilfield costs typically lag behind commodity price decreases. Continued inflationary pressures and increased commodity prices may also result in increases to the costs of our oilfield goods, services and personnel, which would in turn cause our capital expenditures and operating costs to rise.
We are experiencing some inflationary pressure for certain costs, including employees and vendors, although such cost increases did not materially impact our 2022 financial condition or results of operations, and we currently do not expect them to materially impact our 2023 financial results or operations. However, to the extent elevated inflation remains, we may experience further cost increases for our operations, including natural gas purchases and oilfield services and equipment as increasing oil, natural gas and NGL prices increase drilling activity in our areas of operations, as well as increased labor costs. An increase in oil, natural gas and NGL prices may cause the costs of materials and services to rise. We cannot predict any future trends in the rate of inflation and a significant increase in inflation, to the extent we are unable to recover higher costs through higher commodity prices and revenues, would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operation.
Human Capital Resources
At W&T Offshore, people are our most valuable asset. We strive to provide a work environment that attracts and retains the top talent in the industry, reflects our core values and demonstrates these values to the communities in which we operate.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 365 employees and employed an additional 302 individuals who are employees of third parties that primarily provide skilled labor in support of our field operations. This combined workforce conducts our business in Texas, Alabama, Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico. Our workforce in Texas is primarily composed of our corporate employees, including our executive officers, drilling and production managers, technical engineers and administrative and support staff. Our employees in Alabama, Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico are primarily composed of skilled labor who conduct our field operations and manage third party personnel used in support of our field operations. 
Health and Safety. Our highest priorities are the safety of all personnel and protection of the environment. To drive a culture of personnel safety in our operations, we operate under a comprehensive Safety and Environmental Management System (“SEMS”). Our 2022 total recordable incident rate for employees was 0.54, which is far below the industry average for the Gulf of Mexico from 2021 of 9.9. Although incident reporting practices are subject to some subjectivity and vary by operator, we have historically had below average incident rates compared to the industry average for the Gulf of Mexico, and we strive to continue to excel at protecting our personnel. Our Health, Safety, Environmental and Regulatory (“HSE&R”) group is comprised of a Vice President, Environmental, Safety and Regulatory Managers and 10 staff personnel. The group works with field personnel to create and regularly review safety policies and procedures, in an effort to support continuous improvement of our SEMS. Our Board of Directors reviews our material safety metrics on a quarterly basis. Safety and Environmental metrics are incorporated into employee evaluations when determining compensation.
Benefits and Compensation. We pride ourselves on providing an attractive compensation and benefits program that allows our employees to view working at W&T as more than where they work, but a place where they may grow and develop. Our ability to succeed depends on recruiting and retaining top talent in the industry. We believe employees choose W&T in part due to our professional advancement opportunities, on the job training, engaging culture and competitive compensation and benefits.

As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs in order to attract and retain superior talent. These programs not only include base wages and incentives in support of our pay for performance culture, but also health and retirement benefits. We focus many programs on employee wellness. We believe these solutions help the overall health and wellness of our employees and help us successfully manage healthcare and prescription drug costs for our employee population. 
Diversity and Inclusion. We recognize that a diverse workforce provides the best opportunity to obtain unique perspectives, experiences and ideas to help our business succeed, and we are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive workplace to attract and retain talented employees. The key to our past and future successes is promoting a workforce culture that embraces integrity, honesty and transparency to those with whom we interact, and fosters a trusting and respectful work environment that embraces changes and moves us forward in an innovative and positive way. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics prohibits illegal discrimination or harassment of any kind.
Our policies and practices support diversity of thought, perspective, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and expression, race, ethnicity, culture and professional experience. From recent graduates to experienced hires, we seek to attract and develop top talent to continue building a unique blend of cultures, backgrounds, skills and beliefs that mirrors the world we live in.
