 BUSINESS
 Overview
 We are a commercial stage natural‑products pharmaceuticals company focused on developing novel, sustainably derived gastrointestinal products on a global basis. Our wholly‑owned subsidiary, Napo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Napo”), focuses on developing and commercializing proprietary human gastrointestinal pharmaceuticals for the global marketplace from plants used traditionally in rainforest areas. Our Mytesi (crofelemer) product is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adults with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy. 
 Jaguar was founded in San Francisco, California as a Delaware corporation on June 6, 2013. Napo formed Jaguar to develop and commercialize animal health products. Effective as of December 31, 2013, Jaguar was a wholly‑owned subsidiary of Napo, and, until May 13, 2015, Jaguar was a majority‑owned subsidiary of Napo. On

July 31, 2017, the merger of Jaguar Animal Health, Inc. and Napo became effective, at which point Jaguar Animal Health’s name changed to Jaguar Health, Inc. and Napo began operating as a wholly‑owned subsidiary of Jaguar focused on human health and the ongoing commercialization of, and development of follow‑on indications for Mytesi. Most of the activities of the Company are now focused on the commercialization of Mytesi and development of follow-on indications for crofelemer and a second-generation anti-secretory product, lechlemer. In the field of animal health, we have limited activities which are focused on developing and commercializing first‑in‑class gastrointestinal products for dogs, dairy calves, foals, and high value horses.
 We believe Jaguar is poised to realize a number of synergistic, value adding benefits—and an expanded pipeline of potential blockbuster human follow‑on indications of crofelemer, and a second‑generation anti‑secretory agent--upon which to build global partnerships. As previously announced, Jaguar, through Napo, now holds extensive global rights for Mytesi, and crofelemer manufacturing is being conducted at two FDA-inspected and approved locations, including a new, multimillion‑dollar commercial manufacturing facility. Additionally, several of the drug product candidates in Jaguar’s Mytesi pipeline are backed by strong Phase 2 evidence from completed Phase 2 trials.
 Mytesi is a novel, first‑in‑class anti‑secretory agent which has a basic normalizing effect locally on the gut, and this mechanism of action has the potential to benefit multiple disorders. Mytesi is in development for multiple possible follow‑on indications, including diarrhea related to targeted cancer therapy; orphan‑drug indications for infants and children with congenital diarrheal disorders and short bowel syndrome (SBS); supportive care for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); and for idiopathic/functional diarrhea. In addition, a second‑generation proprietary anti‑secretory agent, lechlemer, is in development for cholera. Mytesi has received orphan‑drug designation for SBS.
 Napo has a direct sales force of 16 sales representatives, a national sales director and one regional sales director covering U.S. geographies with the highest potential. In June 2018, we hired Robert J. Griffing, a seasoned industry veteran with a broad range of experience that includes commercializing supportive care and HIV treatments, as chief commercial officer for Napo. With support provided by concomitant marketing, promotional activities, patient empowerment programs and medical education initiatives described below, we expect continued growth in the number of patients treated with Mytesi.
 The goal of Napo's internal sales team is to deliver a frequent and consistent selling message to targeted, high-volume prescribers of antiretroviral therapies (ART) and to gastroenterologists who see large numbers of HIV patients. In December 2017 we released the results of a survey of 350 people living with HIV and AIDS regarding the topic of "Talking to Your Doctor About Symptoms". The survey results show that diarrhea remains prevalent in those living with HIV/AIDS, as 27% of respondents living with HIV/AIDS reported that they currently have diarrhea, while 56% reported that they have had diarrhea in the past. Additionally, the results of a recent Napo-sponsored survey of 271 U.S. board certified gastroenterologists indicate that the number one GI complaint for people living with HIV/AIDS is diarrhea, and 93% of U.S. gastroenterologists see patients with HIV/AIDS in their practice.
 Key to the success of our sales representatives in growing Mytesi sales is differentiating and targeting the right doctors—those HIV specialists who are high prescribers of ART medications and those gastrointestinal doctors who see large populations of people living with HIV/AIDS. The target list of prescribers for our sales reps includes a pool of approximately 3,100 high volume ART prescribing HIV specialists, and gastroenterologists who see the largest number of people living with HIV/AIDs, and we've strategically placed our sales force in the US geographies with the highest potential, including San Francisco, southern California, Arizona, Nevada, Miami/southern Florida, northern Florida, New York City/Long Island, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Connecticut, New Jersey, northern Texas, southern Texas, Chicago, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, North Carolina/South Carolina, Michigan, Indianapolis, Ohio and Atlanta.
 In June 2018, Napo entered into an agreement with RedHill Biopharma, a specialty biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on late clinical-stage development and commercialization of proprietary drugs for gastrointestinal diseases and cancer, to establish a U.S. co-promotion program for Mytesi.

 RedHill's specialized, GI-focused field sales force is promoting Mytesi to health care practitioners in 36 U.S. territories that contain significant numbers of HIV patients and health care practitioners that are not currently covered by Napo's field sales force. In these geographies, RedHill sales representatives target gastroenterologists who see large populations of people living with HIV, along with nurse practitioners and physician assistants. RedHill field representatives also target lower-level prescribers of anti-retroviral infectious disease specialists in regions currently covered by Napo's sales force. Four RedHill inside sales representatives actively target health care practitioners in other regions not covered by the Napo or RedHill field representatives. We believe this copromotion program will play an important role in extending the reach of our commercial efforts into the GI medical community in support of the treatment of people living with HIV (PLWH) with Mytesi. Under the terms of the Agreement, RedHill is compensated based on performance, and the program can be extended by agreement between the two companies , as it was in January 2019.
 Medical education presentations led by health care practitioners (HCPs) participating in the Napo Speakers Bureau—a group that includes HIV/AIDS specialists, infectious disease specialists, gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons, and nurse practitioners—focus on the prevalence and pathophysiology of gastrointestinal consequences of HIV infection and on the latest treatment options for HIV-related diarrhea. Presentations given by patient advocate members provide information to PLWH about the prevalence of diarrhea in PLWH and offer guidance about talking to HCPs regarding diarrhea-related concerns.
 On July 24, 2018, we announced the results of an analysis conducted to examine whether the rate of HIV-associated diarrhea has changed over time. The analysis of data, sourced from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinicaltrials.gov database, revealed that 18% of HIV patients experience diarrhea and the rates have not declined significantly over time. The analysis includes data from 38 U.S. clinical trials from 2008-2016 in more than 21,000 patients. The results were reported at the International AIDS 2018 Conference (AIDS 2018) on Tuesday, July 24 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The poster is available on the AIDS 2018 website at this link: https://programme.aids2018.org//PAGMaterial/eposters/4900.pdf.
 With the introduction of newer antiretroviral (ARV) drug therapy, there has been a reduction in the severity of ARV-induced diarrhea. However, a significant portion of this patient population still suffers from diarrhea caused by HIV enteropathy, which is due to direct and indirect effects of HIV on the intestinal mucosa. Chronic diarrhea remains a significant complaint of people living with HIV/ AIDS, particularly those who are older and have lived with the virus in their gut for 10+ years. According to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, currently more than 50% of people living with HIV are over age 50; by 2020 this figure will increase to 70%.
 Crofelemer (Mytesi) data from a supplemental analysis of the ADVENT trial was featured in a poster presentation at the 9th International Aids Society (IAS) Conference on HIV Science held in July 2017 in Paris, France. The presentation was titled Long-Term Crofelemer Use Gives Clinically Relevant Reductions in HIV-Related Diarrhea. IAS features the latest HIV science, including basic, clinical and prevention research, and brings together a broad cross section of HIV professionals from around the world with a focus on implementation—moving scientific advances into practice. The results indicate that at the end of the study period, more than 50% of the patients treated had complete resolution of their diarrhea; and 83% had at least a 50% reduction in diarrhea. Entry criteria required at least 7 watery stools in a week, and the average was 20 (with some patients having as high at 67 stools in a week).
 Napo continues to pursue AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) formulary listing.  ADAPs provide life-saving HIV treatments to low income, uninsured, and underinsured individuals living with HIV/AIDS in all 50 states and the territories. The ADAP program provides Mytesi free of charge to patients who qualify and copay support for some patients who have insurance coverage. In the third quarter of 2018, Mytesi was added to the ADAP formularies in New York, Tennessee, Mississippi and DC. As announced January 24, 2019, Mytesi has also been added to the formulary for Florida's ADAP, which is the third largest in the U.S. based on enrollment. As a result of this addition, based on data from healthcare research firm Decision Resource Group, approximately 86% of ADAP-eligible US lives now have access to Mytesi, which is now on the ADAP formularies for 30 states, including the five programs with the largest enrollment.

 As we announced April 10, 2018, Napo has signed an agreement with the ADAP Crisis Task Force. The agreement establishes a reduced price provided by Napo ADAPs in all U.S. states and territories for purchases of Mytesi. Formed in 2002, the Task Force negotiates reduced drug prices for all ADAPs. Task Force membership is currently comprised of representatives from Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington state HIV/AIDS divisions. Per the terms of the agreement, all state ADAPs are guaranteed the same reduced price for the drug. ADAPs provide HIV-related services and approved medications to more than half a million people in the U.S. each year, and we expect this agreement to help further expand the number of patients able to benefit from the novel, first-in-class anti-secretory mechanism of action of Mytesi.
 Mytesi is currently reimbursed by Medicaid in all 50 states. It is also currently covered on 100% of the top 10 commercial insurance plan national formularies, representing more than 245 million U.S. lives. Additionally, Napo operates a co-pay coupon program, which helps ensure that the majority of participating patients do not have a Mytesi co-pay greater than $25. Information about the NapoCares Patient Assistance Program, which assists patients with benefit verification, prior authorization, and claims appeals, can be found at mytesi.com/mytesi-savings.html. 
 Pipeline within a product—crofelemer
 According to the World Health Organization, there are nearly 1.7 billion cases of diarrheal disease globally every year. Although not all types of diarrhea are secretory in nature, we view the current, initial approval of Mytesi as the opening of the door to an important pipeline—underscored by the current approval by the FDA of the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) for this natural product, as well as acknowledgement by the FDA of the safety of the product for chronic use for the approved indication.
 Crofelemer is in development for the symptomatic relief of cancer therapy-related diarrhea (CTD). A significant proportion of patients undergoing cancer therapy experience diarrhea. Novel targeted cancer therapy agents, such as epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, with or without cycle chemotherapy agents, may activate intestinal chloride secretory pathways leading to increased chloride secretion into the gut lumen, coupled with significant loss of water, that would result in secretory diarrhea.
 Our planned study for diarrhea related to CTD is analogous to the successful pivotal program we ran for Mytesi’s currently‑approved HIV indication, and as part of risk mitigation we intend to use the same formulation and dosing as the current commercialized Mytesi. As part of Jaguar’s near-term plan, Jaguar had a meeting with the FDA in March 2019 to discuss the anticipated protocol for a planned pivotal trial for the evaluation of crofelemer in CTD. The meeting, which included academic key opinion leaders (KOLs)/Napo Scientific Advisory Board members from leading oncology treatment institutions, resulted in a productive regulatory discussion about design refinements for the anticipated pivotal trial.
 There are two ongoing investigator‑initiated trials (IITs) utilizing Mytesi to address CTD. Enrollment is ongoing for the HALT‑D study at Georgetown University in breast cancer patients on treatment with Herceptin, which is being funded by Genentech Roche, and interim results are expected to be read out in the first half of 2019. The second study, which is funded by Puma, is evaluating the use of crofelemer in subjects receiving neratinib, which has extremely high rates of diarrhea.
 According to data appearing in “Treatment Guidelines for CID” (chemotherapy‑induced diarrhea) in the April 2004 issue of Gastroenterology and Endoscopy News, diarrhea is the most common adverse event reported in chemotherapy patients. Approved third‑party supportive care products for chemotherapy‑induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) include Sustol, Aloxi, Akynzeo and Sancuso. According to Transparency Market Research, sales of therapeutics for the prevention of CINV approximated $620 million in 2013, and sales of such therapeutics are expected to reach $1 billion in 2020.
 Diarrhea has been reported as the most common side effect of the recently approved CDK 4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib and the pan‑HER TKI neratinib, with occurrence ranging from 86% to >95% and grade 3 over 40%, in published studies. Diarrhea in this patient population has the potential to cause dehydration, potential infections, and

non‑adherence to treatment. A novel anti‑diarrheal like Mytesi may hold promise for treating secretory diarrhea—and therefore also support long‑term cancer treatment adherence—in this population.
 As we announced on January 22, 2018, Napo has accepted a request for support submitted by Dr. Mohamad Miqdady, Chief of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City (SKMC) in Abu Dhabi, for an investigator‑initiated trial of crofelemer, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Mytesi, for congenital diarrheal disorders (CDDs) in children.
 CDDs are a group of rare, chronic intestinal channel diseases, with onset in early infancy, that are characterized by severe, lifelong diarrhea and a lifelong need for nutritional intake either parenterally or with a feeding tube. CDDs are related to specific genetic defects inherited as autosomal recessive traits. The incidence of CDDs is prevalent in regions where consanguineous marriages (related by blood) is part of the culture. CDDs are directly associated with serious secondary conditions including dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and failure to thrive, prompting the need for immediate therapy to prevent death and limit lifelong disability.
 SKMC is the Abu Dhabi public health system’s flagship institution and the largest hospital in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), consisting of a 586‑bed tertiary hospital, 14 outpatient specialty clinics, and the Abu Dhabi Blood Bank, all of which are accredited by Joint Commission International, the oldest and largest healthcare standards‑setting and accrediting body in the United States. Dr. Miqdady is an American Board certified in Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, and he is a member of Napo’s Scientific Advisory Board.
 Napo intends to submit documentation in the first half of 2019 to the U.S. FDA for the planned formulation of crofelemer appropriate for feeding tube administration to support this investigation.
 As announced on June 5, 2017, Napo has received orphan‑drug designation from the FDA for pediatric short bowel syndrome (SBS). The Orphan Drug Act provides for granting special status to a drug or biological product to treat a rare disease or condition upon request of a sponsor. Orphan‑drug designation qualifies the sponsor of the drug for various development incentives, including extended exclusivity, tax credits for qualified clinical testing, and relief of filing fees.
 Jaguar’s and Napo’s portfolio development strategy involves meeting with Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) to identify indications that are potentially high‑value because they address important medical needs that are significantly or globally unmet, obtain input on protocol practicality and protocol generation, and then strategically sequencing indication development priorities, second‑generation product pipeline development, and partnering goals on a global basis, as well as identifying possible opportunities for a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) from the FDA. When granted, SPA provides that, upon request, FDA will evaluate within 45 days certain protocols to assess whether they are adequate to meet scientific and regulatory requirements identified by the sponsor. In 2007, under the SPA process, Napo obtained agreement with the FDA for the design of the pivotal study protocol for the currently approved indication of crofelemer (Mytesi) for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adults with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy. The 2007 SPA agreement was an important milestone for Napo, allowing Napo to address and mitigate regulatory uncertainty prior to the completion of its final Phase 3 trial of crofelemer for its currently approved indication. 
 In October 2017, Napo established a scientific advisory board for each potential follow‑on indication currently planned for Mytesi. Napo has developed relationships with physicians and patient advocates around the world who are recognized specialists and key opinion leaders (KOLs) in the planned Mytesi follow‑on indications. The two charts below provide the names, credentials and affiliations of current Napo scientific advisory board members and KOL advisors to Napo.
 We are confident that our scientific advisory boards will provide expert, actionable input regarding all aspects of development, including trial design, for Mytesi for our follow‑on indications—each of which addresses a significant, global, unmet medical need. We also expect that our scientific advisory board members will serve as speakers for our medical education programs, authors on Napo abstracts and publications, and as a resource for media inquiries.

      According to a 2017 report from Research and Markets, the combined global market for prescription and OTC gastrointestinal agents is expected to reach $21 billion by 2025. Jaguar estimates that a first‑in‑class anti‑secretory agent should be able to achieve a significant portion of the market share.
 Our management team has significant experience in gastrointestinal product development for both humans and animals. Napo was founded 30 years ago to perform drug discovery and development by leveraging the knowledge of traditional healers working in rainforest areas. Ten members of the Jaguar and Napo team have been together for more than 15 years. Dr. Steven King, our executive vice president of sustainable supply, ethnobotanical research and intellectual property, and Lisa Conte, our founder, president and CEO, have worked together for more than 30 years. Together, these dedicated personnel successfully transformed crofelemer, which is extracted from trees growing in the rainforest, to Mytesi, which is a natural, sustainably harvested, FDA‑approved drug.
 There are significant barriers to entry for Mytesi (crofelemer). Through Napo, we hold an extensive global patent portfolio. At the present time we hold approximately 142 issued worldwide patents, with coverage in many cases that extends until 2031. These issued patents cover multiple indications including HIV‑AIDS diarrhea, IBS, IBD, manufacturing, enteric protection from gastric juices, among others. We also have approximately 24 pending patent applications worldwide in the human health areas that are being prosecuted.
 Mytesi is the first oral drug approved by the FDA under botanical guidance, which provides another barrier to entry from potential generic competition. The FDA requires that the manufacturer of crofelemer use a validated proprietary bioassay to release the drug substance and drug product of Mytesi. While most generic products are fashioned to meet chemical release specifications that are in the public domain, the specifics of this assay are not publicly available. There is no pathway by which a generic product can be developed for a drug approved under botanical guidance. In addition, Mytesi is not systemically absorbed, so the classic approach of creating a generic drug by 

 
  8

 
matching pharmacokinetic blood levels is not possible. A generic player would have to conduct costly and risky clinical trials.
 While Jaguar’s commercial and development efforts have evolved to focus primarily on Mytesi and human pipeline indications since its merger with Napo, the Company is continuing limited initiatives related to Canalevia, its drug product candidate for treatment of chemotherapy‑induced diarrhea (“CID”) in dogs, and Equilevia, its non‑prescription, personalized, premium product for total gut health in equine athletes. CID in dogs is typically caused by the same mechanism of action as in humans, and hence the work in dogs serves as a preclinical proof of concept for the diarrhea in humans that is related to targeted cancer therapy.
 As previously announced, Jaguar has received MUMS (Minor Use and Minor Species) designation status from the FDA for Canalevia for the indication of CID in dogs. MUMS designation is modeled on the orphan‑drug designation for human drug development and offers possible financial incentives to encourage MUMS drug development, such as the availability of grants to help with the cost of developing the MUMS drug. Additionally, as announced on March 8, 2018, the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has indicated that Jaguar’s Reasonable Expectation of Effectiveness (RxE) technical section is complete towards conditional approval of Canalevia. As announced March 20, 2019, Jaguar has completed the filing with CVM of the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) technical section in support of the Company’s application for conditional approval of Canalevia for treatment of CID in dogs. Jaguar has now completed three of the four required technical sections—the CMC, Effectiveness, and Environmental Impact technical sections—of the Company’s application for conditional approval of Canalevia for CID in dogs. We anticipate filing the Target Animal Safety technical section with CVM in the second quarter of 2019. If Canalevia is approved for CID in dogs, we expect to conduct the commercial launch of Canalevia for this indication in 2020.
 Crofelemer is extracted from the Croton lechleri tree, which we sustainably harvest and manage through programs that we have been developing over the past 29 years. This process has involved working with communities to plant trees, obtaining permits for export, and creating a supply network that is robust and reliable.
 We continue to have working relationships with partners that began in the 1990s. Additionally, through the establishment of a nonprofit called the Healing Forest Conservancy (HFC), our team has created a long‑term mechanism for benefit sharing that recognizes the intellectual contribution of indigenous populations. This program is intended to contribute to the continued strength and effectiveness of the valued and strategically important relationships we have carefully cultivated over the past 29 years.
 Product Pipeline
 In addition to our Mytesi (crofelemer) product that is approved by the U.S. FDA for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adults with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy, we are also developing a pipeline of prescription drug product candidates to address unmet needs in gastrointestinal health through Napo. Mytesi (crofelemer) is a novel, first‑in‑class anti‑secretory agent which has a basic normalizing effect locally on the gut, and this mechanism of action has the potential to benefit multiple disorders. Clinical trials demonstrated that nearly 80% of Mytesi users experienced an improvement in their diarrhea over a four‑week period. At week 20 of the pivotal trial, over half the patients had no watery stools, or a 100% decrease, and 83% had at least a 50% decrease in watery stools. Our Mytesi pipeline currently includes prescription drug product candidates for four follow‑on indications, several of which are backed by Phase 2 evidence from completed Phase 2 trials. In addition, a second‑generation proprietary anti‑secretory agent is in development for cholera.

 Estimated Size of Mytesi Target Markets
 We believe the medical need for Mytesi is significant, compelling, and unmet, and that doctors are looking for a drug product with a mechanism of action that is distinct from the options currently available to resolve diarrhea. A growing percentage of HIV patients have lived with the virus in their gut for 10+ years, often causing gut enteropathy

 The following diagram illustrates the mechanism of action of our human and animal gastrointestinal drug products and drug product candidates, which normalize chloride and water flow and transit time of fluids within the intestinal lumen.

 Business Strategy
 Our goal is to become a leading pharmaceutical company with first‑in‑class, sustainably derived products that address significant unmet gastrointestinal medical needs globally. To accomplish this goal, we plan to:
 Expand Mytesi by leveraging our significant gastrointestinal knowledge, experience and intellectual property portfolio
 Mytesi is a novel, first‑in‑class anti‑secretory agent which has a basic normalizing effect locally on the gut, and this mechanism of action has the potential to benefit multiple gastrointestinal disorders. Our Mytesi (crofelemer) product is approved by the U.S. FDA for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adults with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy. Jaguar, through Napo, holds extensive global rights for Mytesi. Mytesi is in development for multiple possible follow‑on indications, including diarrhea related to targeted cancer therapy; orphan‑drug indications for infants and children with congenital diarrheal disorders and short bowel syndrome; supportive care for inflammatory bowel disease; irritable bowel syndrome; and for idiopathic/functional diarrhea. In addition, a second‑generation proprietary anti‑secretory agent is in development for cholera.
 Our management team collectively has more than 100 years of experience in the development of gastrointestinal prescription drug and non‑prescription products. This experience covers all aspects of product development, including discovery, preclinical and clinical development, GMP manufacturing, and regulatory strategy. Key members of this team successfully developed Mytesi.
 Establish and expand commercial capabilities in Mytesi sales and marketing efforts
 As announced on August 7, 2017, we appointed Pete Riojas, a 29‑year pharmaceutical industry veteran, to lead Napo’s direct sales organization, which is comprised of Mytesi field sales representatives strategically positioned to cover U.S. geographies with the highest potential. Additionally, in June 2018, we hired Robert J. Griffing, a seasoned industry veteran with a broad range of experience that includes commercializing supportive care and HIV treatments, as chief commercial officer for Napo. With support provided by concomitant marketing, promotional activities, patient empowerment programs, including an integrated social digital campaign, and medical education initiatives described below, we expect a proportional response in the number of patients treated with Mytesi.
 In June 2018, as stated above, Napo entered into an agreement with RedHill Biopharma, a specialty biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on late clinical‑stage development and commercialization of proprietary drugs for gastrointestinal diseases and cancer, to establish a U.S. co‑promotion program for Mytesi. RedHill’s specialized, GI‑focused field sales force promotes Mytesi to health care practitioners in 36 U.S. territories that contain 

 
  12

 
significant numbers of HIV patients and health care practitioners that are not currently covered by Napo’s field sales force. In these regions, RedHill sales representatives target gastroenterologists who see large populations of people living with HIV, along with nurse practitioners and physician assistants. RedHill field representatives also target lower‑level ART prescribing infectious disease specialists in regions currently covered by Napo’s sales force. Four RedHill inside sales representatives actively target health care practitioners in other regions not covered by the Napo or RedHill field representatives. We believe this co‑promotion program will play a significant role in extending the reach of our commercial efforts into the GI medical community in support of the treatment of people living with HIV (PLWH) with Mytesi. Under the terms of the Agreement, RedHill is compensated based on performance, and the program can be extended by agreement between the two companies , as it was in January 2019.
 Leverage our relationships with key opinion leaders regarding development of follow‑on indications
 To date, more than 30 key opinion leaders (KOLs) who are recognized specialists in HIV patient care, CTD, IBD, IBS, cholera, SBS, CDD and equine gut health, are participating in our scientific advisory board or KOL advisory program in some manner.
 Establish partnerships to support moving pipeline indications to pivotal clinical trials
 Jaguar is actively pursuing development of a robust pipeline of potential follow‑on indications for crofelemer, and the Company’s goal is to establish partnerships to support moving pipeline indications to pivotal clinical trials.
 Strategically sequence the development of follow‑on indications of Mytesi and seek geographically‑focused licensing opportunities
 As announced September 24, 2018, Jaguar and Knight Therapeutics Inc. (“Knight”) entered into a Distribution, License and Supply Agreement that grants Knight the exclusive right to commercialize Mytesi and related products in Canada and Israel.
 Although it is possible that we may enter into additional corporate partnering relationships related to Mytesi, our intention would be to retain all commercialization and promotional rights in the U.S., so that we do not become primarily a royalty‑collecting organization, and we are opposed to entering into any Mytesi partnering relationship that would require splitting indications. We are seeking to put limited geographically‑focused partnerships in place in the near term, while also considering possibilities for a worldwide partnership with a leading global entity (excluding the US exclusive commercial rights) in the field of gastrointestinal care and cancer in the long term.
 Reduce risks relating to product development
 Risk reduction is a key focus of our product development planning. Mytesi is approved for chronic indication, providing us the ability to leverage this corresponding safety data when seeking approval for planned follow‑on indications that are also chronic or chronic episodic indications. Crofelemer manufacturing is being conducted at two FDA-inspected and approved locations, including a new, multimillion‑dollar commercial manufacturing facility.  In an effort to reduce risk further, we have implemented the following approach: First, we meet with key opinion leaders, typically at medical conferences—as we did in 2017 at Digestive Disease Week for IBS and IBD, the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, and the Multinational Association of Supportive Care and Congress. Next, we confirm unmet medical needs with these key opinion leaders and discuss the practicality of patient enrollment and trial implementation. We then generate protocols to discuss with the FDA, seeking, when possible, special protocol assessments. Our goal, by the time we start devoting significant funds to a clinical trial, is to have de‑risked the program as much as we believe we possibly can, in particular the regulatory pathway. We believe this approach will lead to better long‑term outcomes for our products in development.
 We believe that Jaguar is poised to realize a number of synergistic, value adding benefits—and an expanded pipeline of important human follow‑on indications and a second‑generation anti secretory agent, upon which to build global partnerships.

 In May 2016, the New Drug Application (“NDA”) and commercial rights for human applications of crofelemer (Mytesi) previously licensed to Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Salix”) were transferred to Napo. The active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) in Mytesi is crofelemer, our proprietary, patented gastrointestinal anti‑secretory agent sustainably harvested from the rainforest.
 Diarrhea is a common adverse event seen with chemotherapy agents typically used in breast and colon cancers, and in particular in the more recently introduced therapeutic classes of epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (“TKI”) often used for chronic adjuvant care management of cancer. The increased need for and use of these agents has made diarrhea one of the most disabling issues for cancer patients.
 We will seek partnerships outside the United States for the above indications, while focusing on development, and commercial access in the United States directly. We are also focused on investigating SB‑300 (lechlemer) for various gastrointestinal indications. Lechlemer is a proprietary Jaguar pharmaceutical product, a standardized botanical extract distinct from crofelemer, also sustainably derived from the Croton lechleri tree.
 We believe lechlemer, which has the same mechanism of action as crofelemer and is significantly less costly to produce, may support efforts to receive a priority review voucher from the U.S. FDA for a cholera indication. Priority review vouchers are granted by the FDA to drug developers as an incentive to develop treatments for neglected diseases and rare pediatric diseases. Additionally, we believe lechlemer represents a long‑term pipeline opportunity as a second‑generation anti‑secretory agent, on a global basis, for multiple gastrointestinal diseases—especially in resource‑constrained countries where cost of goods is a factor, in part, because requirements often exist in such regions for drug prices to decrease annually.
 The Company has presented Phase 2 data on crofelemer for the treatment of devastating dehydration in cholera patients from the renowned International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research (icddr,b) in Bangladesh, and Napo plans to follow the same study design for a trial conducted in association with icddr,b in support of development of lechlemer for the potential cholera‑related indication.
 Our portfolio development strategy is based on identifying indications that are potentially high‑value because they address important medical needs that are significantly or globally unmet, and then strategically sequencing indication development priorities, second‑generation product pipeline development, and partnering goals on a global basis.
 Our technology for proprietary gastrointestinal disease products is central to the product pipelines of both veterinary and human indications. Crofelemer is also the API in Canalevia, our lead prescription drug product candidate, intended for the treatment of chemotherapy‑induced diarrhea in dogs. We expect our first veterinary prescription product launch will be Canalevia for chemotherapy‑induced diarrhea, an interesting commercial synergy with the pursuit of follow‑on indications for Mytesi.

 The efficacy of Mytesi 125‑mg delayed‑release tablets twice daily was evaluated in a randomized, double‑blind, 24‑week, multicenter study (the ADVENT trial) comprised of a placebo‑controlled (1 month) treatment period and a placebo‑free (5 month) treatment period. The study enrolled HIV‑positive patients on stable ART with a history of diarrhea for 1 month or more. In the Mytesi 125mg bid group, more than twice as many patients (18% vs. 8% on placebo, p<0.01) achieved the highly rigorous endpoint defined as reduction to ≤2 watery stools per week for 2 out of the 4 weeks in the placebo‑controlled period (the average baseline in the ADVENT population was 20 watery stools per week).
 In a supplemental analysis of the ADVENT study population, 78% of patients in the Mytesi 125mg BID group experienced a decrease in watery stools at week 4. Among these patients that experienced a decrease, 61% had at least a 50% decrease in watery stools. At week 20, 89% of patients in the Mytesi BID group experienced a decrease in watery stools. Among these patients that experienced a decrease, 83% had at least a 50% decrease in watery stools, and over half of patients had no watery stools at all (100% decrease).
 Products in Development
 Cancer Therapy‑Related Diarrhea (CTD)
 Diarrhea related to TCT is a common problem with a relevant mechanism for crofelemer
    
National Cancer Institute Criteria for Grading Severity of Diarrhea
 | Grade 1 | Grade 2 | Grade 3 | Grade 4 
Patients without a colostomy | Increase of <4 stools per day over pretreatment | Increase of 4 to 6 stools per day or nocturnal stools | Increase of ≥7 stools per day or incontinence; need for parenteral support for hydration | Physiologic consequences requiring intensive care; hemodynamic collapse

      Diarrhea is a common adverse event seen with chemotherapy agents in the therapeutic classes of epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (“TKI’s”) and EGFR monoclonal antibodies (for breast, lung, and other malignancies). The increased need for and use of these agents has made diarrhea one of the most disabling issues for cancer patients. Crofelemer offers the potential for an appropriate mechanism of action against this likely secretory diarrhea and has prompted interest among physicians concerned about this diarrheal symptom, stimulating the aforementioned investigator‑initiated trials. Diarrhea is also a common adverse event seen with chemotherapy agents used in colorectal and gastric cancers, and chronic maintenance chemotherapy. There are currently no anti‑diarrhea agents approved generally for chemotherapy‑induced diarrhea.
 Clinical Studies
 A study titled HALT‑D: DiarrHeA Prevention and ProphyLaxis with Crofelemer in HER2 Positive Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab, and Docetaxel or Paclitaxel with or without Carboplatin is currently underway in conjunction with Georgetown University. The primary objective of the study is to characterize the incidence and severity of diarrhea in patients receiving investigational therapy in the setting of prophylactic anti‑diarrheal management.
 A second study, titled An open label study to characterize the incidence and severity of diarrhea in patients with early stage HER2+ breast cancer treated with adjuvant trastuzumab and neratinib followed by neratinib monotherapy, and intensive anti‑diarrhea prophylaxis, is currently underway in conjunction with the University of California at San Francisco. The study is designed to evaluate crofelemer as a salvage anti‑diarrheal therapy used with the investigational breast cancer agent neratinib. The primary objective is to characterize the incidence and severity of diarrhea in patients with early stage breast cancer receiving adjuvant trastuzumab and neratinib followed by 1 year of 

 
  15

 
neratinib monotherapy in the setting of prophylactic anti‑diarrheal management. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the activity of crofelemer as a rescue anti‑diarrheal medication; to assess neratinib adherence, holds, delays, and early discontinuation throughout the course of study therapy, which includes patients receiving neratinib for >1 year; and to assess overall toxicity including constipation and cardiac toxicity with concomitant neratinib and trastuzumab.
 Irritable Bowel Syndrome—Diarrhea Predominant (IBS‑D)
 Diarrhea is a common symptom of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a frustrating, underdiagnosed and undertreated condition. IBS‑D is a subtype characterized mainly by loose or watery stools at least 25 percent of the time. According to the U.S. FDA, studies estimate that IBS affects 10 to 15 percent of adults in the United States.
 Abdominal pain is the key symptom of IBS, and the pain, which is associated with a change in stool frequency or consistency, can be severe. To improve the diagnosis and outcomes for IBS patients and to update clinicians on the latest research, Dr. William Chey, a gastroenterologist and professor of medicine and nutrition sciences at the University of Michigan, along with an international team of collaborators, compiled Rome IV, an updated compendium of diagnostic criteria on functional GI disorders such IBS. Rome IV contains a chapter titled Centrally Mediated Disorders of Gastrointestinal Pain.
 Although new agents for IBS‑D have come on the market, there is an unmet medical need for long‑term, safe management of the abdominal pain associated with IBS‑D. We recognize that patients suffering from IBS‑D may require a poly‑pharmacy approach to lifetime management of their disease. Mytesi, which represents a novel mechanistic approach with the benefit of a long‑term safety profile, could possibly be an important addition to the treatment of IBS‑D, if approved for this indication.
 Mytesi has been demonstrated to be safe for chronic use, and two studies provide statistically significant results of crofelemer use for abdominal pain in women.
 The largest group of IBS sufferers are those with the subtype referred to as IBS‑M (mixed diarrhea and constipation). IBS‑M is also referred to as IBS‑A, because the condition often involves frequent alternating between IBS‑D and IBS‑C (constipation predominant). IBS‑M is distressing for patients as well as difficult to diagnose and manage, and is often associated with pain and urgency as well as significant abdominal distension and bloating. No approved drugs currently exist for IBS‑M. Leading gastroenterologists have stated that IBS‑C drugs may cause diarrhea in an IBS‑M patient, and an IBS‑D drug may cause significant constipation. Since Mytesi has not caused constipation in clinical trials or real-world experience, we therefore believe an opportunity exists for an IBS‑M indication for Mytesi. Resultingly, and due to the demonstrated safety of Mytesi for chronic use and its demonstrated benefit for abdominal pain in women, Napo is considering expanding development efforts to evaluate the IBS‑M indication.
 Clinical Study
 Crofelemer has been tested in safety studies and two significant Phase 2 studies for d-IBS (diarrhea-predominate Irritable Bowel Syndrome) as detailed below.

 
  16

 

 Completed Studies—IBS‑D
 Phase 2a—a randomized double‑blind placebo‑controlled, dose‑ranging (placebo, 125 mg, 250 mg, and 500 mg bid) study over a 12‑week treatment period in 246 patients with d‑IBS (Rome II criteria), including both males and females, whose average age was 50 years old.
 n=245 subjects
 61 placebo
 62 125 mg crofelemer BID
 59 250 mg crofelemer BID
 62 500 mg crofelemer BID
 IBS symptoms (pain, urgency, stool frequency and consistency, and adequate relief) were self‑reported by the patients via an interactive voice response system. Patients needed to exhibit active disease during the two‑week baseline period as defined by a mean daily stool frequency greater than or equal to 2/day, pain score greater than or equal to 1 and stool consistency greater than or equal to 3 (5‑point Lickert scale for pain and consistency) to be enrolled. Patients received treatment for 12 weeks followed by a two‑week treatment free period.
 The protocol‑specified primary efficacy measure was daily stool consistency. Statistical analysis of the primary endpoint found no significant differences between placebo and any of the crofelemer dose groups (p ≥ 0.1434) and no significant dose relationship was seen with regard to change from Baseline to Month 3 in stool consistency scores (p = 0.1165) in the ITT population.
 A supplementary analysis of Rome Foundation‑defined stool consistency and abdominal pain showed positive results. Responders were subjects who had stool consistency score of ≥ 4 for < 25% of days in a given week and ≥ 30% improvement in abdominal pain scores a given week (i.e., Rome Foundation‑defined stool consistency and abdominal pain responders).
 When we look at a supplemental analysis at a reduction in a composite abdominal pain/stool consistency endpoint, the regulatory endpoint in accordance with FDA guidance, we see at the 125 mg dose bid a significant 15% difference with just women patients compared to placebo; and a significant 11% when we include both men and women. The current IBS-d products on the market have a 7‑8% reduction (Viberzi and Xifaxan).
 In this analysis, Rome Foundation‑defined stool consistency and abdominal pain responders were significantly more likely during the entire 3 months in the 125 mg BID group when compared with placebo (24.2% versus 13.1%, p = 0.0399) and there was a statistical trend in favor of crofelemer 125 mg BID during Months 1 through 2 (27.4% versus 16.4%, p = 0.0640). Similar positive effects of crofelemer 125 mg BID were observed in female subjects (n = 183). When the supplementary analysis was applied to the female patients, crofelemer at a dose of 125 mg BID was superior to placebo at Month 3 (26.1% vs 10.9%, p=0.0337).

· | Results: The 125mg bid of crofelemer exhibited a consistent response during each month among most efficacy endpoints in women with d‑IBS reaching statistical significance (p<0.05) for pain.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Crofelemer had little effect on the stool consistency score, though there was a trend toward reduced stool frequency.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Treatment benefits were not apparent in men, although relatively few men enrolled in the trial (13‑16/group).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | As with previous trials of crofelemer, no drug‑related serious adverse events were reported. Adverse event rates were similar across all dose groups, although in the two highest doses (250 and 500 mg bid) there were a higher percentage of dropouts. There were no drug‑related or dose‑related differences in constipation. During the two‑week treatment‑free follow‑up period symptoms approached baseline levels.

 Safety: Crofelemer at doses of 125, 250 and 500 mg had a safety profile that was generally similar to placebo among men and women with IBS-D.
 Phase 2—A Randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled study to assess the safety and efficacy of crofelemer for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome (d‑IBS) in 240 female subjects 18 years or older with active d‑IBS according to the Rome II criteria for the diagnosis of d‑IBS.
 The study consisted of a 2‑week screening period and a 12‑week blinded treatment period followed by a 4‑week treatment‑free follow‑up period. During the 12‑week treatment period 240 subjects were given 125 mg of crofelemer BID or placebo BID and recorded daily assessments of their IBS symptoms in the interactive voice response system.
 The primary endpoint was the change from baseline for overall percentage of abdominal pain/discomfort free days (PFDs). On a daily basis, respondents recorded the intensity of their abdominal pain/discomfort for that day using the 5‑pint Likert scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=intense, 4=severe. Any day that a score of zero (0) was recorded was considered a PFD.
 Stool consistency and abdominal pain endpoints were analyzed using definitions of symptom improvement from a recent FDA guidance on IBS endpoints (March 2010) and recommendations of the Rome Foundation (letter dated 28 June 2010) concerning the IBS endpoints described in this guidance.
 Results: The overall increase in pain‑free days (protocol‑specified primary endpoint) for subjects in the crofelemer group was not statistically significant when compared with subjects in the placebo group (p = 0.5107)
 A supplementary analysis of abdominal pain showed positive results. Responders were subjects who had ≥ 30% improvement in abdominal pain scores a given week (i.e., FDA‑defined abdominal pain responders; this definition of abdominal pain responders was presented in the March 2010 guidance on IBS endpoints).
 In this analysis, abdominal pain responders were significantly more likely during Months 1 through 2 (58.3% versus 45.0%, p = 0.0303) and during the entire 3 months (54.2% versus 42.5%, p = 0.0371) in the crofelemer group when compared to placebo.
 Safety: The overall safety profile for crofelemer 125 mg BID for 12 weeks was comparable to that observed with placebo and was consistent with the IBS population under study.
 Rare Pediatric Disease Indications: Congenital Diarrheal Disorders and Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS)
 Congenital diarrheal disorders (CDD) are a group of rare, chronic intestinal channel diseases, occurring in early infancy, that are characterized by severe, lifelong diarrhea and a lifelong need for nutritional intake either parenterally or with a feeding tube. CDDs are related to specific genetic defects inherited as autosomal recessive traits, and the incidence of CDDs is much more prevalent in regions where consanguineous marriage is part of the culture. CDDs are directly associated with serious secondary conditions including dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and failure to thrive, prompting the need for immediate therapy to prevent death and limit lifelong disability. Potential Orphan‑Drug: Congenital Diarrheal Disorders (CDD) & Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS)
 Clinical Study—CDD
 We have completed safety studies of crofelemer in children as young as 3 months of age, and Napo has accepted a request for support submitted by Dr. Mohamad Miqdady, Chief of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City (SKMC) in Abu Dhabi, for an investigator‑initiated trial of crofelemer, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Mytesi, for CDD in children.

 
  18

 

 A pre‑clinical study in mice, conducted by an independent third‑party investigator, is underway to support possible orphan‑drug designation for crofelemer for Congenital Diarrheal Disorders (CDD). This animal model study is examining the effects of crofelemer on diarrhea caused by microvillous inclusion disease (MVID), a very rare autosomal recessive disorder which belongs to the CDD category.
 SBS is a complex condition characterized by malabsorption of fluids and nutrients due to congenital deficiencies or surgical resection of small bowel segments. Consequently, patients suffer from symptoms such as debilitating diarrhea, malnutrition, dehydration and imbalances of fluids and salts. This could be due to either a genetic disorder or premature birth. In countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, SBS occurs with much higher incidence. Napo recently visited with medical centers in this region.
 We have received orphan‑drug status for Mytesi (crofelemer) for the SBS pediatric indication and are pursuing orphan‑drug status for CDD. The mission of the FDA Office of Orphan Products Development is to advance the evaluation and development of products (drugs, biologics, devices, or medical foods) that demonstrate promise for the diagnosis and/or treatment of rare diseases or conditions.
 IBD—Supportive Care:
 Key opinion leaders (“KOLs”) identified an unmet need to treat diarrhea in IBD patients, particularly in specific subsets of patients. KOLs felt all IBD patients who undergo ileal pouch‑anal anastomosis (IPAA) surgery suffer severe, chronic diarrhea following the procedure. Because this is a highly‑motivated patient population with a low placebo‑responder risk, we believe a relatively small proof‑of‑concept trial is the appropriate next step from a development standpoint.
 KOLs felt crofelemer’s novel mechanism of action may also prove to be an effective treatment for diarrhea that results from bile acid malabsorption, which has been shown to occur in approximately 30% of patients with IBD.
 Additionally, KOLs felt crofelemer’s novel mechanism of action may prove to be an effective treatment for diarrhea experienced by patients receiving IV infusions of Entyvio, a Takeda Pharmaceuticals prescription medicine used in adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease. Secretory diarrhea occurs when the intestine does not complete absorption of electrolytes and water from luminal contents. This can happen when a nonabsorbable, osmotically active substance is ingested (“osmotic diarrhea”) or when electrolyte absorption is impaired (“secretory diarrhea”).
 Secretory diarrhea can result from bacterial toxins, luminal secretagogues (such as bile acids or laxatives), reduced absorptive surface area caused by disease or resection, circulating secretagogues (such as various hormones, drugs, and poisons), and medical problems that compromise regulation of intestinal function. These studies in acute diarrhea support the normalizing aspect of the mechanism of action, regardless of the cause of the diarrhea, and are supportive of the supportive care indication under development in IBD patients.
 Clinical Study
 Mytesi has safety studies that support chronic use for the current approved indication, and has demonstrated statistically significant results in multiple supportive care settings, though not specifically in IBD patients. Next steps would include a Phase 2 proof of concept study for supportive care in patients with IBD.
 Completed Study—Travelers’ Diarrhea (supportive care)
 Phase 2—A study of crofelemer in 184 persons in a double‑blind, placebo‑controlled study for the symptomatic treatment of acute diarrhea among travelers to Jamaica and Mexico.
 The study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of crofelemer in the treatment of travelers’ diarrhea.

 
  19

 

 A total of 184 persons from the United States who acquired diarrhea in Jamaica or Mexico were enrolled in a double‑blind, placebo‑controlled study examining the effectiveness of three doses of crofelemer in reducing illness. Subjects were treated with 125 mg, 250 mg, or 500 mg crofelemer or a matching placebo four times a day for 2 days. Subjects kept daily diaries of symptoms and were seen each day for 3 days. Of the subjects, 169 (92%) were included in the efficacy analysis.
 The most common etiological agent identified was enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, found in 19% of subjects. The mean time interval from taking the first dose of medication until passage of the last unformed stool during 48‑hour therapy (TLUS48) was 38.7 hours for the placebo group.
 TLUS48 was shortened by crofelemer:
 30.6 h for the 125‑mg dose group (p = 0.005);
 30.3 h for the 250‑mg group; and
 32.6 h for the 500‑mg group (p = 0.01).
 Treatment failures were seen in 29.3% in the placebo group compared with 7.3% (p = 0.01), 4.3 (p = 0.002), and 9.8 (p = 0.026) in the three treatment groups. Crofelemer was well tolerated at all doses.
 The study provided statistically significant results of crofelemer use for shortening the duration of travelers’ diarrhea. This antisecretory approach works directly against the pathophysiology of travelers’ diarrhea and is not likely to potentiate invasive forms of diarrhea or to produce posttreatment constipation.
 Cholera/General Watery Diarrhea
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Cholera is an acute, diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. An estimated 3‑5 million cases and over 100,000 deaths occur each year around the world. The infection is often mild or without symptoms, but can sometimes be severe. Approximately one in 10 (5‑10%) of infected persons will have severe disease characterized by profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. In these people, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours. At this time, for example, the largest cholera outbreak in recorded history is occurring in Yemen.
 We are investigating lechlemer for the indication of cholera/general watery diarrhea. Lechlemer is a distinct and proprietary Napo pharmaceutical formulation of a standardized botanical extract, also sustainably derived from the Croton lechleri tree. We believe lechlemer represents a long‑term pipeline opportunity as a second‑generation anti‑secretory agent, on a global basis, for multiple gastrointestinal diseases. Additionally, we believe lechlemer, which has the same mechanism of action as crofelemer and is significantly less costly to produce, may support efforts to receive a priority review voucher from the U.S. FDA for a cholera indication. Priority review vouchers are granted by the FDA to drug developers as an incentive to develop treatments for neglected diseases and rare pediatric diseases. If approved for this indication, lechlemer could serve as long‑term pipeline anti‑secretory agent for cholera/general watery diarrhea in geographies where cost of goods is a critical factor, for example, in resource‑constrained regions and countries in which a requirement exists for drug prices to decrease annually.
 Clinical Study
 We have initiated CMC and have multiple animal and human studies in secretory diarrheas. We have also completed a successful trial design for cholera with an anti‑secretory mechanism of action, published studies with crofelemer in patients with cholera and other acute severe watery diarrhea disease.

 Completed Studies—Cholera and Severe Acute Dehydrating Watery Diarrhea
 Phase 2 study of crofelemer in the treatment acute, severely dehydrating watery diarrhea with confirmed cholera with the use of an antibiotic (azithromycin) and oral rehydration therapy in 100 adult patients between 18 and 55 in Bangladesh.
 A total of 100 adult patients, from Bangladesh, between the ages of 18 and 55, with acute, severely dehydrating watery diarrhea with confirmed cholera were treated with crofelemer on a background of an antibiotic (azithromycin) and oral rehydration therapy. After a four‑hour period of rapid rehydration therapy, patients were randomized 1:2:2 to placebo or 125 mg or 250 mg oral dose of crofelemer. Crofelemer or placebo doses were administered about one hour after the oral administration of azithromycin (1 gm dose). The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and effects of crofelemer on reducing the watery stool output normalized to body weight (mL/kg) in the first 24 hours on the background of azithromycin and rehydration therapy. Crofelemer was well tolerated and there were no drug related adverse events in this study. Both doses of crofelemer produced approximately 25‑30% reduction in median watery stool volumes in the 0‑6 and 0‑12 hour period following initiation of therapy. Crofelemer showed a strong trend in the reduction of watery stool output in the 0‑6 hour and 0‑12 hour intervals (p=0.07). Upon exclusion of three outlier patients, the crofelemer dose of 125 mg produced a statistically significant reduction in the normalized stool output (p=0.028) and the dose of 250 mg crofelemer showed a strong trend for reduction of watery stool output (p=0.07).
 In another study, the effects of crofelemer were evaluated in patients with acute dehydrating watery diarrhea caused by various bacterial pathogens, such as enterotoxic strains of Escherichia coli (ETEC) and Vibrio cholerae infection. Crofelemer was evaluated in adult Indian patients with acute watery diarrhea of less than 24‑hour duration with suspected bacterial infections, without the use of antibiotics. In this study, patients received oral doses of placebo or crofelemer at a dose of 250 mg every 6 hours for 2 days on the background of oral rehydration therapy only. The use of antibiotics was prohibited in this study. A total of 98 patients were randomized into this study (47 in placebo group and 51 in the crofelemer group). Primary endpoints for this study were changes in stool weight, frequency, consistency, duration of diarrhea. Secondary endpoints included the assessment of clinical symptoms scored as total of 7‑item GI index. Clinical success was defined as no diarrhea within 48 hours from study start date and treatment failure was defined as no improvement/worsening of symptoms after 24 hours, fever, bloody stools or dehydration.
 Results: 98 patients (51 crofelemer, 47 placebo) were enrolled in the study. 16 patients (4 in the crofelemer group and 12 in the placebo group) used antibiotics and were considered as treatment failures and were excluded from the “per protocol efficacy analysis”. Groups were similar in age, weight, vital signs, stool frequency, consistency, dehydration and GI index.
 The crofelemer group had improvement over baseline and compared to placebo at day 3. More specifically, crofelemer showed superior effects in reducing stool weight (61% vs 11%), stool frequency (65% vs 21%), reversion to soft stool (92% vs 49%) and improved the 7‑item GI index (70% C vs 33% P), (all p<0.05).
 Crofelemer was well tolerated with no related serious adverse events or concerning changes in lab values. Progression to dehydration and report of fecal incontinence was more common in placebo group (p<0.05).
 Conclusions: Clinical success (cessation of diarrhea within 48 hours of 1st dose) was achieved in 79% of crofelemer patients compared to 28% placebo patients (p<0.05).
 Other Product Potential Future Indications
 Institutional Diarrhea
 Patients in medical institutions such as hospitals often experience diarrhea following infection with Clostridium difficile, an anaerobic bacillus shed in feces. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, any surface, device, or material (e.g., commodes, bathing tubs, and electronic rectal thermometers) that becomes contaminated with feces may serve as a reservoir for the C. difficile spores, which 

 
  21

 
are transferred to patients mainly via the hands of healthcare personnel who have touched a contaminated surface or item. We believe development of an approved formulation of crofelemer for use in C. difficile has the potential to help patients infected with C. difficile leave the hospital sooner, help keep patients infected with C. difficile out of the hospital, and aid in controlling C. difficile contagion in institutional settings, which would also represent a significant economic benefit.
 Competition
 There are several significantly larger pharmaceutical companies competing with us in the gastrointestinal segment. These companies include Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Merck & Co., Inc., and Allergan plc as well as smaller pharmaceutical companies.
 Diarrhea in adult patients living with HIV/AIDs. We are not aware of any other FDA‑approved drugs for the symptomatic relief of diarrhea in HIV/AIDs patients. HIV/AIDs patients also use loperamide and over the counter anti‑diarrheal remedies such as Mylanta or Kaopectate to treat their diarrhea, but these medicines affect motility and can result in rebound diarrhea.
 Diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Two drugs were approved in 2015 for the treatment of diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome, Allergan plc’s Virbezi and Xifaxan which is marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. Also, Lotronex was approved by the FDA in 2000 but was withdrawn from the market and later reintroduced in 2002 under a Risk Management Program. With the exception of Lotronex, the sponsors of Verbezi and Xifaxan employ extensive media and print promotion for the commercialization of these products. We are seeking a partner to further the clinical development and commercialization of crofelemer for d‑IBS. There are currently numerous trials on going for d‑IBS.
 Pediatric diarrhea. Acute diarrhea in children is commonly treated by a change in diet, oral rehydration therapy and/or antibiotics, assuming the cause of the diarrhea is bacterial in nature. Children aged 12 and younger are advised not to use anti‑motility drugs (loperamide for example) unless directed to do so by a physician. There are recent clinical trials for probiotics and zinc sulfate. Other recent anti‑diarrheal studies in children include a safety and tolerability study of Fidaxomicin for C difficile associated diarrhea.
 Cancer therapy-related diarrhea. We are not aware of any FDA‑approved drugs specifically indicated for cancer therapy-related diarrhea, including chemotherapy-related diarrhea. A recent Phase IIb trial of elsiglutide for the treatment of chemotherapy induced diarrhea in colorectal cancer patients did not meet statistical significance. Opioids and over the counter drugs are commonly used to treat chemotherapy induced diarrhea, but these drugs affect motility. Certain tyrosine‑kinase inhibitor chemotherapy agents have diarrhea as a significant side effect. For example, FDA guidance suggests diarrhea prophylaxis prior to initiating adjuvant therapy with neratinib.
 Congenital Diarrheal Disorders and Short Bowel Syndrome. We are not aware of any FDA‑approved drugs specifically indicated for Congenital Diarrheal Disorders and Short Bowel Syndrome.
 Cholera. We are not aware of any FDA‑approved drugs specifically indicated as an anti‑secretory agent for use to address the devastating dehydration in cholera patients.
 Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). If we receive regulatory approval for Mytesi for IBS, we expect to compete with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that operate in the gastrointestinal space, such as Sucampo AG, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Allergan, Inc., Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc., Sebela Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Salix Pharmaceuticals. Because Mytesi is approved with chronic safety and several of the other agents have safety concerns, there is likely to be an opportunity for a polypharmacetuical approach to long‑term management of these patients, removing a direct competitive scenario from Mytesi’s potential entry to the marketplace and disease indication.

 
  22

 

 To our knowledge, there are currently no FDA‑approved anti‑secretory products, in particular which act locally in the gut with the chronic safety profile of crofelemer, in development or on the market. Crofelemer represents a new tool in gastrointestinal disease management.
 Distribution and Marketing Agreements

Napo has agreements in place with BexR, a distributor in Texas, for the distribution, marketing and sale of Mytesi. The agreement compensates BexR with a percentage of net sales, as defined. Payments by Napo to BexR will be a specified percentage of net sales, ranging in the low double digits but in no instance exceeding 20% of net sales, depending on the period in which the sales occur and the amount of such sales.
 On December 4, 2018, Napo entered into the Suspension, Settlement and Termination Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) with SmartPharma, LLC (“SmartPharma”) and the Company, as guarantor, pursuant to which the parties mutually agreed to suspend and then terminate the Strategic Marketing Alliance Agreement, dated April 4, 2016, between Napo and SmartPharma (the “Alliance Agreement”). Under the Alliance Agreement, SmartPharma performed certain marketing and commercialization activities (collectively, the “SP Services”) with respect to Mytesi in consideration for the receipt of a specified percentage of net sales ranging in the low double digits but in no instance exceeding 20% of net sales, depending on the amount of such sales. In the event of termination, Napo would be required to pay SmartPharma a termination fee equal to a certain percentage of net sales generated within a specified period after the termination date. All payment obligations under the Termination Agreement are guaranteed by Jaguar.  The Buyout Fee was  made on or before January 8, 2019 and the Alliance Agreement has been automatically terminated.
 Manufacturing
 The plant material used to manufacture is crude plant latex (“CPL”) extracted and purified from Croton lechleri, a widespread and naturally regenerating tree in the rainforest that is managed as part of sustainable harvesting programs. The tree is found in several South American countries and has been the focus of long‑term sustainable harvesting research and development work. Napo’s collaborating suppliers obtain CPL and arrange for the shipment of CPL to Napo’s third‑party contract manufacturer.
 Napo’s third‑party contract manufacturer, India‑based Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Glenmark), a research‑driven, global, integrated pharmaceutical company, is Napo’s primary manufacturer of crofelemer, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Mytesi. Glenmark processes CPL into crofelemer utilizing a proprietary manufacturing process. The processing occurs at two FDA‑approved Glenmark facilities. Additionally, Napo plans to establish a third processing site, which will be operated by Indena S.p.A., a Milan, Italy‑based contract manufacturer dedicated to the identification, development and production of high‑quality active principles derived from plants, for use in the pharmaceutical, health food and personal care industries. Indena has completed the required technology transfer and pilot manufacturing and has the equipment in place for the initiation of scale up and validation activities to ultimately support commercial scale manufacturing.
 Canalevia will be manufactured by the same process used to manufacture the API that was used in the animal safety studies and the human studies in support of the approval of Mytesi. Napo has also licensed this intellectual property to third parties in connection with its agreements related to the manufacture of crofelemer.
 In May 2014 and June 2014, and as amended in February 2015, we entered into binding memorandums of understanding with Indena S.p.A. to negotiate a definitive commercial supply agreement for the manufacture of crofelemer and the botanical extract, SB‑300.
 We have contracts in place with all the manufacturers and third party testing labs required to manufacture Mytesi and lechlemer. We are finalizing a master service agreement with Glenmark for the manufacture of crofelemer which addresses cost of goods reductions at increasing scale. We are in the process of evaluating alternative and 

 
  23

 
secondary third parties to reduce costs associated with finished product manufacture and the assays necessary to the release specifications of Mytesi.
 Proprietary Library of Medicinal Plants
 We possess a proprietary library of more than 2,300 medicinal plants.
 Intellectual Property
 Trademarks
 We plan to market all of our products under a trademark or trademarks we select and we will own all rights, title and interest, including all goodwill, associated with such trademarks. Mytesi is a registered trademark owned by Napo. License Agreements
 Termination, Asset Transfer and Transition Agreement
 On September 19, 2017 (the “Transfer Date”), Napo entered into the Termination, Asset Transfer and Transition Agreement (the “Glenmark Transition Agreement”) with Glenmark. The Glenmark Transition Agreement supersedes the Glenmark Collaboration Agreement and returns to Napo certain rights which Napo licensed to Glenmark pursuant to the Glenmark Collaboration Agreement related to the development and commercialization of crofelemer for certain specified human indications in India and 140 other countries largely in developing regions (the “Transferred Assets”).
 As a result of the execution of the Glenmark Transition Agreement, we, through Napo, now hold extensive global rights for Mytesi, and also hold commercial rights to the existing regulatory approvals for crofelemer in Brazil, Ecuador, Zimbabwe and Botswana.
 In consideration for Glenmark’s assignment and transfer of the Transferred Assets to Napo, Napo agreed to pay Glenmark in cash, within 45 days after receipt by Napo, 25% of any payment that Napo receives from a third party to whom Napo grants a license or sublicense or with whom Napo partners in respect of, or sells or otherwise transfers the certain specified human indications in India and 140 other countries largely in developing regions any of the Transferred Assets, subject to certain limitations, until Glenmark has received a total of $7 million. As additional consideration for the assignment and transfer of the Transferred Assets, Napo agreed (i) to enter into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Glenmark for crofelemer, which will be manufactured at either or both of Glenmark’s facilities in India (this master service agreement is in final draft form, though not yet fully executed) and (ii) to transfer and assign to Glenmark all right, title and interest in and to certain required dedicated equipment used to manufacture crofelemer located at Glenmark’s Ankleshwar facility, subject to certain limitations.

 Government Regulation
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of prescription drugs such as those Napo is developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of Napo’s drug product candidates. To comply with the 

 
  25

 
regulatory requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which Napo is seeking to market and subsequently sell its prescription products, Napo is establishing processes and resources to provide oversight of the development, approval processes and launch of its products and to position those products in order to gain market share.
 U.S. Government Regulation
 In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and its implementing regulations.
 The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

· | completion of pre‑clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become approved before human clinical trials may begin;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, of the study protocol and informed consent forms for the clinical site before each trial may be initiated. Multiple sites may necessitate the involvement of multiple IRBs and submissions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an NDA which would include the study reports of the clinical trials, chemistry and manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and the final dosage form as well as other required sections to be included in the NDA;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

  Pre‑clinical Studies
 Pre‑clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the drug product’s chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre‑clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some pre‑clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND 

 
  26

 
automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects pursuant to a clinical protocol, under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives or endpoints of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA under the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.govwebsite.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

· | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness depending on the endpoints set forth in the protocol.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well‑controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk‑benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Special Protocol Assessment
 The special protocol assessment, or SPA, process is designed to facilitate the FDA’s review and approval of drugs by allowing the FDA to evaluate issues related to the adequacy of certain clinical trials, including Phase 3 clinical trials that can form the primary basis for a drug product’s efficacy claim in an NDA. Upon specific request by a clinical trial sponsor, the FDA will evaluate the protocol and respond to a sponsor’s questions regarding, among other things, primary efficacy endpoints, trial conduct and data analysis, within 45 days of receipt of the request.
 The FDA ultimately assesses whether the protocol design and planned analysis of the trial are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness of the indication studied. All agreements and disagreements between the FDA and the sponsor regarding a SPA must be clearly documented in a SPA letter or the minutes of a meeting between the sponsor and the FDA.

 
  27

 

 Even if the FDA agrees to the design, execution and analyses proposed in protocols reviewed under the SPA process, the FDA may revoke or alter its agreement under the following circumstances:

· | public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the director of the review division determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy has been identified after testing has begun;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a sponsor fails to follow a protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the relevant data, assumptions, or information provided by the sponsor in a request for SPA change, are found to be false statements or misstatements, or are found to omit relevant facts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A documented SPA may be modified, and such modification will be deemed binding on the FDA review division, except under the circumstances described above, if FDA and the sponsor agree in writing to modify the protocol and such modification is intended to improve the study.
 Marketing Approval
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre‑clinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (“PREA”), as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations; this would include information which supports dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 The FDA may also require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
 The FDA may also require other information as part of the NDA filing such as an environmental impact statement. The FDA can waive some or delay compliance with some of these requirements.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.

 
  28

 

 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter must contain a statement of specific items that prevent the FDA from approving the application and will also contain conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or pre‑clinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post‑approval studies, Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post‑marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Post‑Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. New secondary indications must be supported by clinical trials or data. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 The FDA may impose a number of post‑approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post‑marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third‑party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.

 
  29

 

 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post‑market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, include, but are not limited to:

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines, warning letters or holds on post‑approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

  The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off‑label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off‑label uses may be subject to significant liability. In addition, the FDA regulates the purity and or consistency of the approved product. Products, if deemed adulterated can lead to serious consequences as set forth above as well as civil and criminal penalties.

 To the extent that any of Napo’s product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, Napo may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post‑marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti‑fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 In order to market Napo’s future products in the EEA (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and many other foreign jurisdictions, a sponsor must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations:

· | the Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto‑immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  30

 

Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk‑benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing, or reference products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre‑clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The 10‑year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 In the EEA, marketing authorization applications for new medicinal products not authorized have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee (“PDCO”). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the marketing authorization is obtained in all Member States of the EU and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension. For orphan‑drug designated medicinal products, the 10‑year period of market exclusivity is extended to 12 years.
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical and biological products, other U.S. federal and state healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, which include, but are not limited to, state and federal anti‑kickback, false claims, data privacy and security and physician payment and drug pricing transparency laws.
 The U.S. federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti‑Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the U.S. federal Anti‑Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case‑by‑case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to 

 
  31

 
mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
 Additionally, the intent standard under the U.S. federal Anti‑Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti‑kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third‑party payor, including commercial insurers.
 The federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the civil False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, or off‑label, uses. Companies also have been prosecuted for allegedly violating the Anti‑Kickback Statute and False Claims Act as a result of impermissible arrangements between companies and healthcare practitioners or as a result of the provision of remuneration by the companies to the healthcare practitioners. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states also have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 Violations of fraud and abuse laws, including federal and state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), disgorgement and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties, as well as imprisonment, also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees of such companies. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government authorities will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, the ACA broadened the reach of certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes created under HIPAA by amending the intent requirement such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers. The ACA imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act for covered manufacturers for certain payments and 

 
  32

 
“transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures.” Covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. In addition, certain states require implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices and/or tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.
 Napo may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which Napo conducts its business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical products for which Napo obtains regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third‑party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use Napo’s products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of Napo’s products. Sales of any products for which Napo receives regulatory approval for commercial sale will therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third‑party payors. Third‑party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States, the process for determining whether a third‑party payor will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third‑party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA‑approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third‑party payor not to cover Napo’s product candidates could reduce physician utilization of Napo’s products once approved and have a material adverse effect on Napo’s sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a third‑party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third‑party reimbursement may not be available to enable Napo to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on Napo’s investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third‑party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require Napo to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of Napo’s products to each payor separately and will be a time‑consuming process.
 In the EEA, governments influence the price of products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product 

 
  33

 
candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low‑priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of pharmaceutical or biological products have been a focus in this effort. Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost‑effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third‑party payors do not consider Napo’s products to be cost‑effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover Napo’s products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow Napo to sell its products at a profit.
 Healthcare Reform
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third‑party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, once empaneled, will have authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs; and establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending. Since its enactment, the U.S. federal government has delayed or suspended implementation of certain provisions of the ACA. In addition, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and Napo expects there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, in January 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate passed legislation, which, if signed into law, would repeal certain aspects of the ACA. In addition, Congress could consider subsequent legislation to replace those elements of the ACA if so repealed.
 Napo expects that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and additional downward pressure on the price that Napo receives for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government‑funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Moreover, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent Napo from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize Napo’s drugs.
 Additionally, on August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional action is taken by Congress. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which manufacturers set prices 

 
  34

 
for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products.
 Napo expects that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for Napo’s products once approved or additional pricing pressures.
 Animal Health Business
 The development, approval and sale of animal health products are governed by the laws and regulations of each country in which we intend to seek approval, where necessary, to market and subsequently sell our prescription drug and non‑drug products. To comply with these regulatory requirements, we are establishing processes and resources to provide oversight of the development, approval processes and launch of its products and to position those products in order to gain market share in each respective market.
 Certain U.S. federal regulatory agencies are charged with oversight and regulatory authority of animal health products in the United States. These agencies, depending on the product and its intended use may include the FDA, the USDA and the Environmental Protection Agency. The approval of prescription drugs intended for animal use is regulated by the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine (“CVM”). In addition, the Drug Enforcement Administration regulates animal therapeutics that are classified as controlled substances. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission may in the case of non‑drug products, regulate the marketing and advertising claims being made.
 Marketing Exclusivity
 We are currently planning on seeking MUMS designation for some of our prescription drug products and if we receive such a designation, we will be entitled to a seven‑year marketing exclusivity, which means that we will face no competition from another sponsor marketing the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use. If we were to lose such designation or not receive such designation but our application as a new animal drug is found to be a new chemical entity that meets the criteria described by the FDA, we would be entitled to a five‑year marketing exclusivity. In order to receive this five‑year exclusivity, the FDA would have to find in its approval of our application that our NADA contains an API not previously approved in another application, that the application itself is an original application, not a supplemental application, and that our application included the following studies: one or more investigations to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness of the drug for which we are seeking approval; animal safety studies and human food safety studies (where applicable). If the NADA is seeking approval of a drug for which we have received conditional approval, we, upon approval would still be entitled to a five‑year marketing exclusivity provided we meet the criteria as set forth above. If, however, our NADA is for a drug for which the FDA has determined that the drug contains an API that has previously been approved, regardless of whether the original approval was for use in humans or not, we may only be entitled to a three‑year marketing exclusivity provided that the NADA is an original, not supplemental, application and contains both safety and efficacy studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the drug which is the subject of the application. We have received MUMS designation for Canalevia for the indication of chemotherapy‑induced diarrhea, or CID, in dogs. Additionally, the FDA has indicated that the use of Canalevia for the treatment of EID in dogs qualifies as a “minor use”, which means that Canalevia is eligible for conditional approval for the indication of EID in dogs. Labeling
 The FDA plays a significant role in regulating the labeling, advertising and promotion of animal drugs. This is also true of regulatory agencies in the EU and other territories. In addition, advertising and promotion of animal health products is controlled by regulations in many countries. These rules generally restrict advertising and promotion to those claims and uses that have been reviewed and approved by the applicable agency. We will conduct a review of advertising 

 
  35

 
and promotional material for compliance with the local and regional requirements in the markets where we eventually may sell its product candidates.
 Other Regulatory Considerations
 We believe regulatory rules relating to human food safety, food additives, or drug residues in food will not apply to the products we currently are developing because our animal prescription drug product candidates are not intended for use in production animals, with the exception of horses, which qualify as food animals in Europe and Canada; and our non‑prescription products are not regulated by section 201(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which the FDA is authorized to administer.
 Our animal prescription drug product candidates currently in development, if approved, may eventually face generic competition in the United States and in the EU after the period of exclusivity has expired. In the United States, a generic animal drug may be approved pursuant to an abbreviated new animal drug application (ANADA). With an ANADA, a generic applicant is not subject to the submission of new clinical and safety data but instead must only show that the proposed generic product is a copy of the novel drug product, and bioequivalent to the approved novel product. However, if our product candidates are the first approved by the FDA or the EMA as applicable for use in animals, they will be eligible for a five‑year marketing exclusivity in the United States and 10 years in the EU thereby prohibiting generic entry into the market. If the product has MUMS designation it has a seven‑year marketing exclusivity.
 We do not believe that our animal non‑prescription products are currently subject to regulation in the United States. The CVM only regulates those animal supplements that fall within the FDA’s definition of an animal drug, food or feed additive. The Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act defines food as “articles used for food or drink for man or other animals and articles used as components of any such article.” Animal foods are not subject to pre‑market approval and are designed to provide a nutritive purpose to the animals that receive them. Feed additives are defined as those articles that are added to an animal’s feed or water as illustrated by the guidance documents. Our non‑prescription products are not added to food, are not ingredients in food nor are they added to any animal’s drinking water. Therefore, our non‑prescription products do not fall within the definition of a food or feed additive. The FDA seeks to regulate such supplements as food or food additives depending on the intended use of the product. The intended use is demonstrated by how the article is included in a food, or added to the animals’ intake (i.e., through its drinking water). If the intended use of the product does not fall within the proscribed use making the product a food, it cannot be regulated as a food. There is no intent to make our non‑prescription products a component of an animal food, either directly or indirectly. A feed additive is a product that is added to a feed for any reason including the top dressing of an already prepared feed. Some additives, such as certain forage, are deemed to be Generally Recognized as Safe (“GRAS”), and therefore, not subject to a feed Additive Petition approval prior to use. However, the substances deemed GRAS are generally those that are recognized as providing nutrients as a food does. We do not believe that our non‑prescription products fit within this framework either. Finally, a new animal drug refers to drugs intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals. Our non‑prescription products are not intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent disease and therefore, do not fit within the definition of an animal drug. Our non‑prescription products are intended to support a healthy gut, support fluid retention, and normalize stool formation in animals suffering from scours. Additionally, because a previously marketed human formulation of the botanical extract in our non‑prescription products was considered a dietary supplement subject to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (and not regulated as a drug by the FDA), we do not believe that the FDA would regulate the animal formulation used in our non‑prescription products in a different manner. We do not believe that our non‑prescription products fit the definition of an animal drug, food or food additive and therefore are not regulated by the FDA at this time.
 In addition to the foregoing, we may be subject to state, federal and foreign healthcare and/or veterinary medicine laws, including but not limited to anti‑kickback laws, as we may from time to time enter consulting and other financial arrangements with veterinarians, who may prescribe or recommend our products. If our financial relationships with veterinarians are found to be in violation of such laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties.

 Legal Proceedings
 From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business. Other than as set forth below, there are currently no claims or actions pending against us, the ultimate disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. March 2018 Demand Letter relating to 2018 Special Meeting of Stockholders
 While not a legal proceeding, on March 27, 2018, we received a demand letter from a law firm representing a purported stockholder, relating to certain approvals obtained at a special meeting of stockholders on March 12, 2018 (the “2018 Special Meeting”). The demand letter alleges that we miscalculated the votes with respect to (i) the proposal to amend our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation as filed with Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on March 15, 2018 (the “COI”), which increased the authorized shares of Common Stock from 250,000,000 to 500,000,000 (the “Share Increase Proposal”) and (ii) the proposal to amend the COI to effect a reverse stock split at a ratio of not less than 1‑for‑1.2 and not greater than 1‑for‑10 (the “Former Reverse Stock Split Proposal”).We did not implement the Former Reverse Stock Split Proposal. In addition, at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders held on May 18, 2018, stockholders approved amendments to the COI to (i) effect a reverse stock split at a ratio of not less than 1‑for‑11 and not greater than 1‑for‑15 and (ii) decrease the number of authorized shares of Common Stock to 150,000,000.

On September 5, 2018, we responded to the law firm, indicating that the Board unanimously rejected the demands set forth in the demand letter (the “Demand Letter Claims”). While no proceedings with respect to the demand letter were ever initiated, we believe that the allegations set forth in the demand letter were without merit and we would have vigorously defended against any such proceeding. The Demand Letter Claims were settled with a release of all such claims in March 2019 without any material financial settlement costs incurred by us.
 July 2017 Complaint Relating to the Merger
 On July 20, 2017, a putative class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, Civil Action No. 3:17‑cv‑04102, by Tony Plant (the “Plaintiff”) on behalf of shareholders of the Company who held shares on September 30, 2017 and were entitled to vote at the 2017 Special Shareholders Meeting, against the Company and certain individuals who were directors as of the date of the vote (collectively, the “Defendants”), in a matter captioned Tony Plant v. Jaguar Animal Health, Inc., et al., making claims arising under Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a‑9, 17 C.F.R. § 240.14a‑9, promulgated thereunder by the SEC. The claims alleged false and misleading information provided to investors in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus on Form S‑4 (File No. 333‑217364) declared effective by the SEC on July 6, 2017 related to the solicitation of votes from shareholders to approve the merger and certain transactions related thereto. We accepted service of the complaint and summons on behalf of itself and the United States‑based director Defendants on November 1, 2017. We have not accepted service on behalf of, and Plaintiff has not yet served, the non‑U.S.‑based director Defendants.
 On October 3, 2017, Plaintiff filed a motion seeking appointment as lead plaintiff and appointment of Monteverde & Associates PC as lead counsel. That motion was granted. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint against the Company and the United States‑based director Defendants on January 10, 2018. The Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on March 12, 2018, for which oral arguments were held on June 14, 2018. The court dismissed the complaint on September 20, 2018. Plaintiff was entitled to amend the complaint within 20 days from the date of dismissal. On October 10, 2018, Plaintiff amended the complaint to focus on our commercial strategy in support of Equilevia and the related disclosure statements in the Form S‑4 described above. On November 6, 2018, the Defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint. The Defendants argue in their motion that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because the omissions and misrepresentations alleged in the complaint are immaterial as a matter of law. The court has elected to rule on Defendants’ motion to dismiss without holding oral arguments. If the Plaintiff were able to prove its allegations in this matter and to establish the damages it asserts, then an adverse ruling could have a material impact on us. We believe that it is not probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of any potential loss is not reasonably estimable.
