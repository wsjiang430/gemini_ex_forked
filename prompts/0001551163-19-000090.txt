ITEM 1: | BUSINESS

Introduction
 Longwen Group Corp., (the Company), was originally incorporated on March 31, 1980, under the laws of the State of California as Expertelligence, Inc. On June 26, 2006, the Company reincorporated in Nevada. On January 23, 2017, after a series of various name changes, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation (Charter Amendment) to effect the current name change of Longwen Group Corp. 

The Charter Amendment was approved by our majority shareholder, who holds 52% of our outstanding voting securities, on December 6, 2016. In connection with the Charter Amendment, on January 24, 2017, the Company received approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for its name change as stated above and voluntary trading symbol request from DHPS to LWLW.
The Company underwent a change of control on January 21, 2016, at which time Harold Minsky resigned in all officer positions. G. Reed Petersen and White Rim Cattle Company LLC each purchased 25,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company from Harold Minsky. Mr. Petersen is the Member Manager of White Rim Cattle Company, LLC and thus can be considered a control person of all 50,000,000 shares of stock of the Company. Pursuant to a Board of Directors meeting, Mr. Petersen was elected to and accepted all the officer positions previously held by Harold Minsky. 

Effective November 29, 2016, G. Reed Peterson sold 66,667 shares of common stock of the Company to Longwen Group Corp., a Grand Cayman company (Longwen). All of the shares held by Longwen are restricted securities. As a result of the transactions, Mr. Petersen no longer owns any of the Companys capital stock or securities and he and his affiliates waived all loans and other amounts due to the Company. In addition, on such date, Mr. Petersen resigned in all officer capacities from the Company, and Mr. Xi Zhen Ye, President of Longwen, was appointed a Director of the Company and President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company and Mr. Keith Wong was appointed Chief Operating Officer of the Company. Mr. Ye also became the sole director of the Company.

On or about April 5, 2016, the Company effected a 1 for 750 share reverse split of its issued and outstanding common stock. On such date, the Companys common stock was reduced from 95,164,140 to 127,061 shares outstanding.

Current Status of our Business

Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), the Company qualifies as a shell company, because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations.  Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements.

The Companys principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our management and the Companys principal shareholders. Current or future management of the Company may decide to hire outside consultants to assist in the investigation and selection of business opportunities, and might pay a finders fee, in stock or in cash, as allowed by law. Since the Company has no current plans to use any outside consultants, no criteria or policies have been adopted.

As of the date of this report, the Company has not entered into any definitive agreement with any party, nor have there been any specific discussions with any potential business combination candidate regarding business opportunities for the Company.  The Company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, the Company will consider the following kinds of factors:
 
(a)         Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; 
 
(b)         Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole;
 
(c)         Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment;
 (d)         Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;
 
(e)         The cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials;
 
(f)         The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; and
 
(g)         The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items.
 
In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to the Company's limited capital available for investigation, the Company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired. In evaluating a prospective business combination, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as possible given the lack of information which may be available regarding private companies, our limited personnel and financial resources and the inexperience of our management with respect to such activities. We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with the target businesss incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, including but not limited to attorneys, accountants, consultants or such other professionals. The costs associated with hiring third parties to complete a business combination target may be significant and are difficult to determine as such costs may vary depending on a variety of factors, including the amount of time it takes to complete a business combination, the location of the target company and the size and the complexity of the target company. Our limited funds and the lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business combination. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors or other associated with the target business seeking our participation.
 
We anticipate that business opportunities will come to the Companys attention from various sources. These sources may include, but not be limited to, its principal shareholders, professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants, securities broker-dealers, and others who may present unsolicited proposals. Currently, the Company has no agreements, whether written or oral, with any individual or entity, to act as a finder for the Company.  However, at the present, we contemplate that our majority shareholders or our sole officer and certain of their affiliates may introduce a business combination target to us.

It is possible that the range of business opportunities that might be available for consideration by the Company could be limited by the impact of Securities and Exchange Commission regulations regarding purchase and sale of penny stocks. The regulations would affect, and possibly impair, any market that might develop in the Companys securities until such time as they qualify for listing on NASDAQ or on another exchange which would make them exempt from applicability of the penny stock regulations.
 
The Company believes that various types of potential merger or acquisition candidates might find a business combination with the Company to be attractive. These include acquisition candidates desiring to create a public market for their shares in order to enhance liquidity for current shareholders, acquisition candidates which have long-term plans for raising capital through the public sale of securities and believe that the possible prior existence of a public market for their securities would be beneficial, and acquisition candidates which plan to acquire additional assets through issuance of securities rather than for cash, and believe that the possibility of development of a public market for their securities will be of assistance in that process. Acquisition candidates who have a need for an immediate cash infusion are not likely to find a potential business combination with the Company to be an attractive alternative.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. The amount of time it takes to complete a business combination, the location of the target company and the size and complexity of the business of the target company are all factors that determine the costs associated with completing a business combination transaction. The time and costs required to complete a business combination transaction can be ascertained once a business combination target has been identified. Any costs incurred with respect to evaluation of a prospective business combination that is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us.

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. There are numerous public shell companies either actively or passively seeking operating businesses with which to merge in addition to a large number of blank check companies formed and capitalized specifically to acquire operating businesses. Additionally, we are subject to competition from other companies looking to expand their operations through the acquisition of a target business. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Further, our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses.
 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities with a business objective similar to ours to acquire a target business on favorable terms.
 
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. Many of our target business competitors are likely to be significantly larger and have far greater financial and other resources than we will. Some of these competitors may be divisions or subsidiaries of large, diversified companies that have access to financial resources of their respective parent companies. Our target business may not be able to compete effectively with these companies or maintain them as customers while competing with them on other projects. In addition, it is likely that our target business will face significant competition from smaller companies that have specialized capabilities in similar areas. We cannot accurately predict how our target business competitive position may be affected by changing economic conditions, customer requirements or technical developments. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources to compete effectively.

Acquisition Structure
 
It is impossible to predict the manner in which the Company may participate in a business opportunity. Specific business opportunities will be reviewed as well as the respective needs and desires of the Company and the promoters of the opportunity and, upon the basis of that review and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such promoters, the legal structure or method deemed by management to be suitable will be selected. Such structure may include, but is not limited to leases, purchase and sale agreements, licenses, joint ventures and other contractual arrangements. The Company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership, corporation or other form of organization. Implementing such structure may require the merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company with other corporations or forms of business organization, and although it is likely, there is no assurance that the Company would be the surviving entity. In addition, the present management, board of directors and stockholders of the Company most likely will not have control of a majority of the voting shares of the Company following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, the Companys existing management and directors may resign and new management and directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders. 
 
It is likely that the Company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of Common Stock or other securities of the Company. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called tax free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, depends upon the issuance to the stockholders of the acquired company of a controlling interest (i.e. 80% or more) of the common stock of the combined entities immediately following the reorganization. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other tax free provisions provided under the Internal Revenue Code, the Companys current stockholders would retain in the aggregate 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares. This could result in substantial additional dilution in the equity of those who were stockholders of the Company prior to such reorganization. Any such issuance of additional shares might also be done simultaneously with a sale or transfer of shares representing a controlling interest in the Company by the principal shareholders. The Company does not intend to supply disclosure to shareholders concerning a target company prior to the consummation of a business combination transaction, unless required by applicable law or regulation.  In the event a proposed business combination involves a change in majority of directors of the Company, the Company will file and provide to shareholders a Schedule 14F-1, which shall include, information concerning the target company, as required. The Company will file a current report on Form 8-K, as required, within four business days of a business combination which results in the Company ceasing to be a shell company. This Form 8-K will include complete disclosure of the target company, including audited financial statements.
 
It is anticipated that any new securities issued in any reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemptions, if any are available, from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of the transaction, the Company may agree to register such securities either at the time the transaction is consummated, or under certain conditions or at specified times thereafter. The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market that might develop in the Companys securities may have a depressive effect upon such market.
 
It is anticipated that any reorganization transaction will likely create significant dilution to existing shareholders.

Investment Company Act and Other Regulations
 
The Company may participate in a business opportunity by purchasing, trading or selling the securities of such business. The Company does not, however, intend to engage primarily in such activities. Specifically, the Company intends to conduct its activities so as to avoid being classified as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Act), and therefore to avoid application of the costly and restrictive registration and other provisions of the Investment Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
 
Section 3(a) of the Investment Act contains the definition of an investment company, and it excludes any entity that does not engage primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, or that does not engage in the business of investing, owning, holding or trading investment securities (defined as all securities other than government securities or securities of majority-owned subsidiaries) the value of which exceeds 40% of the value of its total assets (excluding government securities, cash or cash items). The Company intends to 

8

implement its business plan in a manner which will result in the availability of this exception from the definition of Investment Company. Consequently, the Companys participation in a business or opportunity through the purchase and sale of investment securities will be limited.
 
 The Companys plan of business may involve changes in its capital structure, management, control and business, especially if it consummates a reorganization as discussed above. Each of these areas is regulated by the Investment Act, in order to protect purchasers of investment company securities. Since the Company will not register as an investment company, stockholders will not be afforded these protections.
 
Any securities which the Company might acquire in exchange for its Common Stock are expected to be restricted securities within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act). If the Company elects to resell such securities, such sale cannot proceed unless a registration statement has been declared effective by the 
 U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission or an exemption from registration is available. Section 4(1) of the Act, which exempts sales of securities not involving a distribution, would in all likelihood be available to permit a private sale. Although the plan of operation does not contemplate resale of securities acquired, if such a sale were to be necessary, the Company would be required to comply with the provisions of the Act to effect such resale. 
 
An acquisition made by the Company may be in an industry which is regulated or licensed by federal, state or local authorities. Compliance with such regulations can be expected to be a time-consuming and expensive process.

Employees

At December 31, 2018, the Company did not have any employees. However, we have engaged consultants for accounting, legal, and other part-time and occasional services.
