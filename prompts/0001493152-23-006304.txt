Item 1. Business
 
As used in this report, the terms “Lazydays,” “the Company,” “Holdco,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Lazydays Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires.
 
Andina Acquisition Corp. II (“Andina”) was originally formed for the purpose of effecting a business combination with one or more businesses or entities. On March 15, 2018, the initial business combination was consummated. As a result, the business of Lazy Days’ R.V. Center, Inc. and its subsidiaries became our business. Accordingly, Lazydays Holdings, Inc. is now a holding company operating through our direct and indirect subsidiaries.
 
Company History
 
Andina was formed as an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on July 1, 2015 for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses.
 
From the consummation of the initial public offering (“IPO”) of Andina until October 27, 2017, Andina was searching for a suitable target business to acquire. On October 27, 2017, a merger agreement was entered into by and among Andina, Andina II Holdco Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Andina (“Holdco”), Andina II Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (“Merger Sub”), Lazy Days’ R.V. Center, Inc. (“Lazydays RV”) and solely for certain purposes set forth in the merger agreement, A. Lorne Weil (the “Merger Agreement”). The Merger Agreement provided for a business combination transaction by means of (i) the merger of Andina with and into Holdco, with Holdco surviving and becoming a new public company (the “Redomestication Merger”) and (ii) the merger of Lazy Days’ R.V. Center, Inc. with and into Merger Sub with Lazy Days’ R.V. Center, Inc. surviving and becoming a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (the “Transaction Merger” and together with the Redomestication Merger, the “Mergers”). On March 15, 2018, Holdco held an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders, at which the Andina shareholders approved the Mergers and other related proposals. On the same date, the Mergers were closed. In connection with the Mergers, the business of Lazy Days’ R.V. Center, Inc. and its subsidiaries became the business of Holdco. As a result of the Mergers, our stockholders and the shareholders of Andina became stockholders of Holdco and the Company changed the name of Holdco to “Lazydays Holdings, Inc.”
 
Overview
 
Lazydays Holdings, Inc. operates Recreational Vehicle (“RV”) dealerships across the U.S. and offers a comprehensive portfolio of products and services for RV owners and outdoor enthusiasts. We generate revenue by providing a full spectrum of RV products: New and pre-owned RV sales, RV-parts and service, financing and insurance products, third-party protection plans, after-market parts and accessories, and RV camping facilities. We believe, based on industry research and internal estimates, that we operate one of the world’s largest RV dealerships, measured in terms of on-site inventory, located on 126 acres outside Tampa, Florida.
 
We strive to create diversification in our products, services, brands and geographic locations to reduce dependence on any one manufacturer, reduce susceptibility to changing consumer preferences, manage seasonality and market risk and maintain profitability. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 18 locations, representing more than 30 original equipment manufacturers (“OEM’s”) across 11 states.
 
Business Strategy
 
With over forty years of history dating back to 1976, Lazydays is an iconic brand that we believe is synonymous with the RV lifestyle, and is known nationally as The RV Authority ®, a registered trademark. We seek to provide customers with a seamless online and in store experience, targeting RV enthusiasts who are seeking a lifestyle centered around the RV. Lazydays has built its reputation on providing an outstanding customer experience with exceptional service and product expertise. One of our primary goals is to create “Customers for Life” by offering a unique purchasing experience that combines our large selection of new and used RV inventory with a nationwide team of experienced sales and service, customer-focused professionals.

Our long-term strategy to create value for our customers, employees and shareholders includes the following:
 
Driving Operational Excellence Across Our Existing Stores
 
We are focused on improving performance through increasing market share and profitability at each of our locations. By promoting an entrepreneurial model, we are building strong businesses responsive to each of our local markets. Utilizing performance-based action plans, we strive to drive operational performance and develop high-performing teams. We believe our strong brands, market position, ongoing investment in our service platform, broad product portfolio and full array of RV offerings will continue to provide us with a competitive advantage in targeting and capturing a larger share of consumers, including the growing number of new RV enthusiasts that we believe are entering the market. We continuously work to attract new customers to our dealership locations through targeted integrated digital and traditional marketing efforts, attractive offerings, and access to our wide array of resources for RV enthusiasts. The Company has focused specifically on marketing to the fast-growing RV demographics of Baby Boomers, Gen X and Millennials. The Company also markets to these segments through RV lifestyle-focused partnership and sponsorship efforts.
 
Our performance-based culture is geared toward an incentive-based compensation structure for a majority of our personnel. We develop pay plans that are measured upon various factors such as customer satisfaction, profitability and individual performance metrics. These plans serve to reward team members for creating exceptional customer experiences, customer loyalty and achieving store potential. This approach allows us to mitigate fluctuations in RV sales and general economic conditions.
 
Growth Through Acquisitions and Greenfields
 
The RV industry is highly fragmented with primarily independent dealers. We target increasing our physical network of stores through acquisitions to strategically grow our presence and create density in our network to provide convenience for our customers across the country. Our value-based acquisition strategy targets underperforming stores with strong brands in desirable markets. As we integrate these stores into our network, we focus on increasing profitability through gaining market share, elevating the customer experience and leveraging our cost structure.
 
In addition to acquisitions, we will, from time to time, open greenfield sites in new or existing markets. We are currently on track to open four future greenfield sites located in the following markets: Council Bluffs, Iowa; Fort Pierce, Florida; Wilmington, Ohio; and Surprise, Arizona.
 
Leveraging Our Scale and Cost Structure to Create Operational Efficiencies
 
As we grow, we are positioned to leverage our scale to improve operating margins. We have centralized many administrative functions to drive efficiencies and streamline store-level operations. The reduction of administrative functions at our stores allows our local teams to focus on customer-facing opportunities to increase revenues and gross profit. Our stores also receive supply chain management support, ensuring optimal levels of new and used RV inventory; and finance and insurance product and training support to provide a full array of offerings to our customers.
Community Involvement
 
We are committed to making an impact in our communities. In 2005, Lazydays employees formed the Lazydays Employee Foundation (the “Foundation”), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization focused on making a positive impact in the lives of at-risk children. The Foundation is run exclusively by employees as volunteers and members of the Foundation’s board of directors, and their mission is to measurably change the lives of children by instilling hope, inspiring dreams and empowering them with education. Since its inception, the Foundation has donated more than $2.5 million to help disadvantaged children in Florida, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota and Tennessee. The Foundation sponsors two facilities in Florida that carry its name; The Lazydays House at a Kids Place which houses foster children in a facility where siblings can remain together and the Lazydays House at Bridging Freedom which houses and rehabilitates children rescued from human trafficking. The Foundation also provides financial contributions to other smaller community programs that benefit at-risk youth by providing educational tutoring, expression through the arts, and education scholarships. Lazydays employees also volunteer their time to many worthwhile charities and engage in life enriching activities with at-risk youth. The Foundation has received multiple awards for their philanthropic work, including the national Arthur J. Decio Humanitarian Award for outstanding civic and community outreach in the RV industry, as well as the Olin Mott Golden Heart Award and several WEDU Be More awards.

Customers and Markets
 
The RV industry is characterized by RV enthusiasts’ investment in, and steadfast commitment to, the RV lifestyle. Approximately 11 million U.S. households are estimated to own an RV.
 
Owners invest in insurance, extended service contracts, parts and accessories, roadside assistance and regular maintenance to protect and maintain their RVs. They typically invest in new accessories and the necessary installation costs as they upgrade their RVs. They also spend on services and resources as they plan, engage in, and return from their road trips. Furthermore, based on industry research and management’s estimates, we believe that RV owners typically trade-in to buy another RV every four to five years.
 
Per the RV Industry Association’s (RVIA) December 2022 survey of manufacturers, total RV wholesale shipments ended 2022 at 493,268, down 17.8% compared to 600,240 units in 2021. Towable RVs were down 20.1% at 434,858 from 544,028 units and motorhome shipments were up 3.9% at 58,410 units from 56,212 units in 2021. Per the RVIA survey, 2022 ended with the third best year on record of wholesale shipments. Generally, pre-owned RVs are sold at a lower price point than comparable new RVs and the sale of pre-owned RVs has historically been more stable than the sale of new vehicles through business cycles.
 
We believe RV trips remain one of the least expensive types of vacation, allowing RV owners to travel more while spending less. RV trips offer savings on a variety of vacation costs, including, among others, airfare, lodging, pet boarding and dining. While fuel costs are a component of the overall vacation cost, we believe fluctuations in fuel prices are not a significant factor affecting a family’s decision to take RV trips. Based on RVIA information, the average annual mileage use of an RV is between 3,000 and 5,000 miles. In addition, our customer research indicates that customers are attracted to RV ownership based on the comfortable and convenient travel it provides.
 
Competition
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the RV industry are breadth and depth of product selection, pricing, convenient dealership locations, quality technical services, customer service, and overall experience. We compete directly and/or indirectly with RV dealers, RV service providers, and RV parts and accessories retailers. One of our direct competitors, Camping World Holdings, Inc., is publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Additional competitors may enter the businesses in which we currently operate.
Marketing and Advertising
 
We market our product offerings through integrated marketing campaigns across all digital and traditional marketing disciplines, with an emphasis on digital. Our marketing efforts include our website, paid and organic search efforts, email, social media, online blog and video content, television, radio, billboards, direct mail, and RV shows and rallies. We also have exclusive partnership and sponsorship relationships with various RV lifestyle properties. We currently have a segmented marketing database of over 2.5 million RV owners and prospects. Our principal marketing strategy is to leverage our unique brand positioning, extensive product selection, exclusive benefits, and high quality customer experience among RV owners.
 
Our total website traffic for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 28.1 million visits with approximately 27.6 million unique visitors. Our website features over 6,000 new and pre-owned RVs, as well as information regarding our RV financing and insurance products, service capabilities, parts and accessories offerings, and other RV lifestyle content.
 
We measure our marketing productivity and effectiveness with front end analytics integrated with 1st party data to optimize marketing efforts.

Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
 
We own a variety of registered trademarks and service marks related to our brands and our services, protection plans, products and resources, including Lazydays, Lazydays The RV Authority ®, Lazydays RV Accessories & More, Crown Club, and Exit 10, among others. We also own numerous domain names, including Lazydays.com, LazydaysRVSale.com, LazydaysEvents.com, and LazydaysService.com among many others. We believe that our trademarks and other intellectual property have significant value and are important to our marketing efforts.
Government Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to varying degrees of federal, state and local regulation, including our RV sales, vehicle financing, outbound telemarketing, email, direct mail, roadside assistance programs, extended vehicle service contracts and insurance activities. These laws and regulations include consumer protection laws, so-called “lemon laws,” privacy laws, escheatment laws, anti-money laundering laws, environmental laws and other extensive laws and regulations applicable to new and pre-owned vehicle dealers, as well as a variety of other laws and regulations. These laws also include federal and state wage and hour, anti-discrimination and other employment practices laws.
Motor Vehicle Laws and Regulations
 
Our operations are subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards promulgated by the United States Department of Transportation and the rules and regulations of various state motor vehicle regulatory agencies. We are also subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations relating to the sale, transportation and marketing of motor vehicles. Federal, state and local laws and regulations also impose upon vehicle operators’ various restrictions on the weight, length and width of motor vehicles that may be operated in certain jurisdictions or on certain roadways. Certain jurisdictions also prohibit the sale of vehicles exceeding length restrictions. Federal and state authorities also have various environmental control standards relating to air, water, noise pollution and hazardous waste generation and disposal.
 
Our financing activities with customers are subject to federal truth-in-lending, consumer leasing and equal credit opportunity laws and regulations as well as state and local motor vehicle finance laws, leasing laws, installment finance laws, usury laws and other installment sales and leasing laws and regulations, some of which regulate finance and other fees and charges that may be imposed or received in connection with motor vehicle retail installment sales.
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, established the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (“BCFP”), an independent federal agency funded by the United States Federal Reserve with broad regulatory powers and limited oversight from the United States Congress. Although automotive dealers are generally excluded, the Dodd-Frank Act could lead to additional, indirect regulation of automotive dealers, in particular, their sale and marketing of finance and insurance products, through its regulation of automotive finance companies and other financial institutions.
 
Insurance Laws and Regulations
 
As a marketer of insurance programs, we are subject to state rules and regulations governing the business of insurance including, without limitation, laws governing the administration, underwriting, marketing, solicitation and/or sale of insurance programs. The insurance carriers that underwrite the programs that we sell are required to file their rates for approval by state regulators. Additionally, certain state laws and regulations govern the form and content of certain disclosures that must be made in connection with the sale, advertising or offering of any insurance program to a consumer. We are required to maintain certain licenses to market insurance programs.
Marketing Laws and Regulations
 
The Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and each of the states have enacted consumer protection statutes designed to ensure that consumers are protected from unfair and deceptive marketing practices. We review all of our marketing materials for compliance with applicable FTC regulations and state marketing laws.

Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Regulations
 
Our operations involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling and/or disposal of materials such as motor oil and filters, transmission fluids, antifreeze, refrigerants, paints, thinners, batteries, cleaning products, lubricants, degreasing agents, tires and propane. Consequently, our business is subject to a variety of federal, state and local requirements that regulate the environment and public health and safety.
 
Most of our dealership locations utilize aboveground storage tanks, and to a lesser extent underground storage tanks, primarily for petroleum-based products. Storage tanks are subject to periodic testing, containment, upgrading and removal requirements under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and its state law counterparts. Clean-up or other remedial action may be necessary in the event of leaks or other discharges from storage tanks or other sources. In addition, water quality protection programs under the federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act), the Safe Drinking Water Act and comparable state and local programs govern certain discharges from some of our operations. Similarly, air emissions from our operations, such as RV painting, are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and related state and local laws. Certain health and safety standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States Department of Labor and related state agencies also apply to certain of our operations.
 
Although we incur costs to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the ordinary course of our business, we do not presently anticipate that these costs will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We do not have any material known environmental commitments or contingencies.
 
Insurance
 
We utilize insurance to provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, product liability, general liability, business interruption, property liability, director and officers’ liability, cyber, environmental issues, and vehicle liability. Beginning in 2020, we became self-insured for employee health-care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering actuarial reports, historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, stop loss coverage and other assumptions. Our results could be adversely affected by claims and other expenses related to such plans and policies if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had over 1,400 employees, almost all of which are full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we have not had any labor-related work stoppages. We believe that our employee relations are in good standing.
 
Seasonality and Effects of Weather
 
Our operations generally experience modestly higher volumes of vehicle sales in the first half of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the hospitable warm climate during the winter months at our Florida and Arizona locations. In addition, the northern locations in Colorado, Tennessee, Minnesota, Indiana, Oregon, Oklahoma, Washington and Wisconsin generally experience modestly higher vehicle sales during the spring months.
 
Our largest RV dealership is located near Tampa, Florida, which is in close proximity to the Gulf of Mexico. A severe weather event, such as a hurricane, could cause severe damage to property and inventory and decrease the traffic to our dealerships. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage, if we were to experience a catastrophic loss, we may exceed our policy limits, and/or may have difficulty obtaining similar insurance coverage in the future.
 
Principal Executive Offices
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 4042 Park Oaks Boulevard, Suite 350, Tampa, Florida 33610 and our telephone number is (813) 246-4999.
