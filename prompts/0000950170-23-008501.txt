ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 TerrAscend is a leading North American cannabis operator with vertically integrated licensed operations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, Maryland and California, and is a cannabis retailer in Ontario, Canada with a minority-owned dispensary in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. TerrAscend’s cultivation and manufacturing practices yield consistent and high-quality cannabis, providing industry-leading product selection to both the medical and legal adult-use markets. Notwithstanding the fact that various states in the U.S. have implemented medical marijuana laws or that have otherwise legalized the use of cannabis, the use of cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law for any purpose, by way of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.
 TerrAscend operates under one operating segment, which is the cultivation, production and sale of cannabis products.
 TerrAscend owns a portfolio of operating businesses and several synergistic brands including:
 •Gage Growth ("Gage"), a vertically integrated cannabis cultivator, processor and dispensary operator in Michigan;
 •KISA Enterprises MI, LLC and KISA Holdings, LLC (collectively "Pinnacle"), a dispensary operator in Michigan;
 •Ilera Healthcare ("Ilera"), a vertically integrated cannabis cultivator, processor and dispensary operator in Pennsylvania;
 •TerrAscend NJ, LLC (“TerrAscend NJ”), a majority owned subsidiary that operates three dispensaries in New Jersey with the ability to cultivate and process;

 •The Apothecarium, consisting of retail dispensaries in California, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey; 
 •Valhalla Confections, a provider of premium edible products;
 •State Flower, a California-based cannabis producer operating a licensed cultivation facility in San Francisco, California;
 •Arise Bioscience Inc. ("Arise"), a manufacturer and distributor of hemp-derived products, located in Boca Raton, Florida; and
 •TerrAscend Canada (“TerrAscend Canada” or “TCI”) is a cannabis retailer in Ontario, Canada with a minority-owned dispensary in Toronto, Ontario, Canada ("Cookies Canada"). TerrAscend Canada was previously a Licensed Producer (as such term is defined in the Cannabis Act) of cannabis until TerrAscend commenced an optimization of its operations in Canada, whereby TerrAscend reduced its manufacturing footprint in order to focus on its Cookies Canada retail business, as well as monetize its intellectual property portfolio in Canada. TerrAscend ceased operations at its manufacturing facility during the three months ended December 31, 2022. 
 TerrAscend’s head office and registered office is located at 3610 Mavis Road, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, L5C 1W2.

Arise’s whole-plant hemp extract products are made in the United States and are available for sale in retail locations in the United States. Effective March 1, 2023, TerrAscend sold substantially all of the Arise assets, including all intellectual property and inventory, to a third party.
TerrAscend Canada
 TerrAscend Canada is a cannabis retailer in Ontario Canada with a minority-owned dispensary in Toronto, Ontario, Canada ("Cookies Canada"), and its current principal business activities include the retail sale of recreational ("recreational" or "adult-use") cannabis to consumers. TerrAscend Canada was previously a Licensed Producer (as such term is defined in the Cannabis Act) of cannabis until TerrAscend commenced an optimization of its operations in Canada, whereby TerrAscend reduced its manufacturing footprint in order to focus on its Cookies Canada retail business, as well as monetize its intellectual property portfolio in Canada. Prior to the optimization of its operations, TerrAscend Canada operated out of a 67,300 square foot facility located in Mississauga, Ontario and was licensed to cultivate, process and sell cannabis for medical and non-medical purposes. These licenses allowed for sales of dried cannabis, cannabis oil and extracts, topicals, and edibles. TerrAscend ceased operations at its manufacturing facility during the three months ended December 31, 2022. As such, the Canadian Licensed Producer results are presented in discontinued operations in this Annual Report.
Reorganization
 Entry into the U.S. Cannabis Market and Capital Reorganization
 TerrAscend was incorporated under the Ontario Business Corporations Act on March 7, 2017. At the time TerrAscend had limited operations in the U.S. and did not engage in the business of, or derive any revenue from, the cultivation, distribution or possession of cannabis in the United States. On October 9, 2018, TerrAscend announced its intention to pursue growth opportunities in the U.S. cannabis market, including potential acquisitions of operators in states that have legalized cannabis for medical or recreational use. In connection therewith, TerrAscend began exploring potential acquisition targets with significant market share and strong brand recognition. To support this strategy, TerrAscend entered into an agreement with Canopy Growth Corporation (“Canopy Growth”), RIV Capital Inc. (formerly Canopy Rivers Inc.) (“RIV Capital”), and entities controlled by Jason Wild, chairman of TerrAscend (JW Opportunities Master Fund, Ltd., JW Partners, LP, and Pharmaceutical Opportunities Fund, LP) to reorganize the capital of TerrAscend (the “TerrAscend Reorganization”) and obtain waivers of certain contractual covenants that at the time, restricted TerrAscend from operating in the U.S. The TerrAscend Reorganization was implemented by way of a statutory plan of arrangement on the terms set out in the Arrangement Agreement and was subject to court approval, the approval of TerrAscend’s shareholders, and other customary conditions. The TerrAscend Reorganization was completed on November 30, 2018.
Acquisitions
 Acquisition of Grander Assets
 On December 24, 2018, TerrAscend announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Grander, a manufacturer and distributor of hemp-derived wellness products. The transaction closed on January 15, 2019. Substantially all of the operating assets of Grander were indirectly acquired by TerrAscend through a wholly owned subsidiary Arise. As consideration, TerrAscend paid $12.7 million, comprising $6.5 million in cash, 1,362,343 Common Shares, and $0.5 million in working capital adjustments. The fair value of the Common Shares was $5.1 million as at January 15, 2019. Subject to meeting certain earnings milestones, TerrAscend agreed to pay up to an additional $10 million in cash or share considerations. The total value of the potential purchase consideration payable by TerrAscend under the terms of the agreement was approximately $22.7 million, and the fair value of the contingent consideration was $0.6 million as at January 15, 2019. Based on performance of the Arise business during the measurement period, the milestones for the additional $10 million payment were not met and the total purchase consideration paid by TerrAscend remained $12.7 million.
Acquisition of The Apothecarium Dispensaries in Northern California
 On June 6, 2019, TerrAscend closed a series of transactions to acquire controlling interests in three entities in California operating the retail dispensary brand known as “The Apothecarium.” The transactions also included the acquisition of entities that were seeking to operate two additional retail locations in Northern California, which were ultimately opened in Berkeley and Capitola, and Valhalla, a leading provider of premium edible products. TerrAscend acquired 49.9% of the outstanding equity interests of the entities operating the three San Francisco The Apothecarium Dispensary locations and TerrAscend has the right (or, in certain circumstances, obligation) to acquire the remaining equity interests of those entities post-closing, following receipt of certain regulatory approvals. As consideration, TerrAscend paid $71.8 million, comprising $36.8 million in cash, $1.1 million in the form of a working capital adjustment, contingent consideration of $3 million and 6,700 TerrAscend proportionate voting shares (“Proportionate Voting Shares”). TerrAscend retains 100% of the economics of entities operating the three San Francisco locations and the Berkeley and Capitola locations of The Apothecarium Dispensaries through control of such entities.
Acquisition of Ilera
 On September 16, 2019, TerrAscend acquired 100% of the equity of the entities comprising Ilera for total consideration of $225 million paid in a combination of cash and Common Shares. At closing, TerrAscend paid to the sellers $25 million in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments, an additional $25 million worth of Proportionate Voting Shares in the equity of TerrAscend equivalent to approximately 5,059.102 Proportionate Voting Shares (which are each exchangeable for 1,000 Common Shares), and $601,000 in working capital adjustments. Additional cash consideration of $175 million in aggregate was paid to the sellers based on Ilera achieving certain specified sales and profitability targets, with staged payments made in 2020 and 2021. On June 30, 2021 the final earn-out had been calculated and remaining fair value amount of $29.7 million was paid on that date.
Acquisition of State Flower
 On January 23, 2020, TerrAscend obtained control of ABI SF LLC, owner of State Flower, a premium California cannabis brand that is currently sold through dispensaries in California. As consideration, TerrAscend converted its previously issued note receivable and accrued interest in the amount of $3 million into a 49.9% equity interest in State Flower. TerrAscend also recorded contingent consideration payable of $6.6 million, representing the expected consideration payable to acquire the remaining 50.1% of State Flower, which comprises 100% of its preferred shares, subject to regulatory approval. TerrAscend retains 100% of the economics of State Flower through control of ABI SF LLC and has the right to acquire the remaining equity interests of ABI SF LLC, following receipt of certain regulatory approvals. On December 31, 2021, the final earn-out was calculated. TerrAscend made a payment of $7.0 million in January 2022. The remaining amount of $1.4 million will be paid to the sellers of State Flower upon TerrAscend’s acquisition of the remaining 50.1% of State Flower.
Acquisition of HMS

Acquisition of Keystone Canna Remedies
 On April 30, 2021, TerrAscend, through a wholly owned subsidiary, acquired KCR (the "KCR Acquisition"). The transaction added three retail dispensaries located in Bethlehem, Allentown and Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. Prior to the acquisition, TerrAscend owned 10% of KCR. TerrAscend acquired the remaining 90% of the equity for total consideration of $69.8 million comprised of $34.4 million in Common Shares, $20.5 million in cash, $7.1 million related to the fair value in previously owned shares, and a $6.8 million noting bears 10% annual interest, and was settled when due in April 2022.

Upon closing of the agreement, TerrAscend now owns 87.5% of the issued and outstanding equity of TerrAscend NJ.
TerrAscend has the option to purchase an additional 6.25% ownership, for a total of 93.75%, at a predetermined valuation during the period commencing April 1, 2023 through June 15, 2023.
 Acquisition of Gage

Principal Products
 TerrAscend offers a competitive product portfolio, ranging from flower, concentrates, vaporizables, edibles and/or accessories, in the jurisdictions in which TerrAscend operates. TerrAscend strives to develop and introduce innovative products to serve patients’ and customers’ unique needs.
Principal Markets
 TerrAscend currently has operations in the United States and Canada. In the United States, TerrAscend sells cannabis products in Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and California. In Canada, TerrAscend operates its Cookies Canada retail business, as well as is monetizing its intellectual property portfolio. TerrAscend’s Arise business also sells whole-plant hemp extract products in retail locations across the United States where legally permitted. TerrAscend’s business is not generally cyclical or seasonal in nature.
Distribution Methods
 TerrAscend distributes its branded products across dispensaries in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Michigan and California. In Canada, TerrAscend sells its products to consumers in Ontario. TerrAscend’s Arise business also sells whole-plant hemp extract products in retail locations across the United States where legally permitted.
 Sources and Availability of Materials
 TerrAscend grows or procures the primary component of its finished products, namely cannabis. TerrAscend’s cultivation operations are dependent on a number of key inputs and their related costs including raw materials and supplies related to its growing operations, as well as electricity, water and other utilities.
 Specialized Knowledge and Skills
 TerrAscend’s business requires specialized skills and knowledge. TerrAscend believes its team has developed and sourced business systems to effectively and efficiently operate its wholesale operations and retail cannabis operations in the states and provinces in which it operates in the U.S. states and Canadian provinces in which it operates. The brand building, retail marketing and product development knowledge and skills of TerrAscend’s management team and employees will be essential to TerrAscend becoming a well-respected household name within the retail cannabis industry. Please see Item 1A – “Risk Factors” – “Risks Related to TerrAscend’s Business, Operations and Industry” – “TerrAscend is dependent on suppliers and key inputs for the cultivation, extraction and production of cannabis products.”
Competitive Conditions
 TerrAscend faces, and will continue to face, competition from new and existing licensed cannabis operators, competitors with existing retail operations, government owned retailers and the illicit market and other applicable participants in the cannabis wholesale and manufacturing industry. Some of the competitors of TerrAscend may have greater financial resources, market access and manufacturing and marketing experience than TerrAscend. Due to challenging market conditions in certain states, some operators have exited the industry and in doing so have heavily discounted their products, creating pressure on pricing.
Increased competition by numerous independent cannabis retail outlets, wholesalers and larger and better financed competitors (including new entrants), and heavily discounted products by exiting players could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend.
 TerrAscend’s competition can be grouped into the following categories:
 (a)Vertically Integrated Competitors: This class of competitors (which may include licensed producers of cannabis that are able to produce cannabis and cannabis products sold at retail stores of their affiliates) includes well-financed competitors with an established operating history in North America.
 (b)Existing Retailers: This class of competitors includes early-stage and semi-developed retail cannabis businesses, as well as established retail cannabis businesses, which may be well capitalized, and which may also have an established and longer retail operating history in North America.
 (c)Government Competition: This class of competitors includes government wholesalers that sell directly to consumers in the Provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario.
 (d)Illicit Market: This class of competitors includes individuals and businesses operating in the illicit market within various jurisdictions across North America. These competitors may divert sizeable commercial opportunities from TerrAscend.
 (e)Existing Wholesalers: This class of competitors includes early-stage and semi-developed wholesalers, as well as established wholesalers, which may be well capitalized, and which may also have an established and longer retail operating history in North America.
 (f)Exiting Competitors: This class of competitors may be vertically integrated or may only operate at retail or wholesale, and due to financial distress are exiting the cannabis market. These competitors may heavily discount their products during the process of winding down their operations. 


Protection of Intellectual Property
 The ownership and protection of TerrAscend’s intellectual property rights is a significant aspect of TerrAscend’s future success. Currently the Company relies on trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information. The Company protects its intellectual property by seeking and obtaining registered protection where possible, developing and implementing standard operating procedures to protect trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information and entering into restrictive agreements with parties that have access to the Company’s inventions, trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information, such as TerrAscend’s partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, to protect confidentiality and ownership. The Company also seeks to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of its inventions, trade secrets, trademarks, technical know-how and proprietary information by maintaining physical security of the Company’s premises and physical and electronic security of its information technology systems.
 In addition, the Company has sought and will continue to seek trademark protection in the United States and Canada. TerrAscend’s ability to obtain registered trademark protection for cannabis-related goods and services, in particular for cannabis itself, may be limited in certain countries outside of Canada, including the United States, where registered federal trademark protection is currently unavailable for trademarks covering marijuana-related products and services that are illegal under the CSA. Accordingly, TerrAscend’s ability to obtain intellectual property rights or enforce intellectual property rights against third party uses of similar trademarks may be limited in certain countries. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office released a policy on May 2, 2019 that clarifies that applications for trademarks for products that meet the definition of hemp could be accepted for registration, with certain exceptions.
 Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2022, TerrAscend employed 1,125 employees, none of whom were subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Of these employees, approximately 972 were full-time. TerrAscend believes it has a good relationship with its employees.
 TerrAscend believes in building a diverse team, and it strives to make TerrAscend a welcoming space where everyone can make an impact on TerrAscend’s success. TerrAscend encourages talented people from all backgrounds to join TerrAscend and strives to make it a place of inclusion.
 TerrAscend is committed to providing a safe and secure work environment in accordance with applicable labor, safety, health, anti-discrimination and other workplace laws. TerrAscend strives for all TerrAscend’s employees to feel safe and empowered at work. To that end, TerrAscend maintains a hotline that employees can call, with the option of remaining anonymous, to voice concerns.
 Licenses and Regulatory Framework in United States
 TerrAscend and its subsidiaries, as applicable, currently hold all necessary state licenses and permits to carry on the activities it conducts.
Summary of U.S. Cannabis Regulatory Regime
 The cannabis industry is subject to various state and local laws, regulations and guidelines relating to the cultivation, manufacture, distribution, sale, storage and disposal of medical and recreational cannabis, as well as laws and regulations relating to health and safety, the conduct of operations and the protection of the environment. The U.S. regulatory scheme varies in its terminology and definitions, using “cannabis”, “marijuana” and “hemp” as distinct terms. The regulatory environment governing the medical and recreational marijuana industries in the United States, where state law permits such activities, are, and will continue to be, subject to evolving regulation by governmental authorities. Accordingly, there are a number of risks associated with investing in businesses in an evolving regulatory environment, including, without limitation, increased industry competition, rapid consolidation of industry participants and potential insolvency of industry participants.
 38 states plus the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam that have authorized medical marijuana and approximately 21 states plus the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Commonwealth of Northern Marina Islands who have authorized adult-use marijuana. Notwithstanding the permissive regulatory environment of medical, and in some cases also recreational marijuana at the state level, marijuana remains a Schedule I drug under the CSA, making it illegal under U.S. federal law to cultivate, manufacture, distribute, sell or possess marijuana in the United States. Furthermore, financial transactions involving proceeds generated by, or intended to promote, cannabis-related business activities in the United States may form the basis for prosecution under applicable U.S/ federal money laundering legislation.


The U.S. federal government’s approach to enforcement of marijuana laws has trended toward deference to state laws where a robust state regulatory framework exists. On August 29, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) issued a memorandum known as the “Cole Memorandum” to all U.S. Attorneys’ offices. The Cole Memorandum generally directed U.S. Attorneys not to prioritize the enforcement of federal marijuana laws against individuals and businesses that comply with state medical marijuana programs. The Cole Memorandum, while not legally binding and only a policy statement, assisted in managing the tension between state and federal laws concerning all medical and adult-use state-regulated marijuana businesses.
 On January 4, 2018, the Cole Memorandum was rescinded by former Attorney General Sessions. While this did not create a change in federal law, the revocation added to the uncertainty of U.S. federal enforcement of the CSA in states where marijuana use is regulated. Former Attorney General Sessions also issued a one-page memorandum known as the “Sessions Memorandum” which confirmed the rescission of the Cole Memorandum and explained that the Cole Memorandum was “unnecessary” due to existing general enforcement guidance as set forth in the U.S. Attorney’s Manual. While the Sessions Memorandum does emphasize that marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance, and states the statutory view that it is a “dangerous drug and that marijuana activity is a serious crime,” it does not otherwise indicate that the prosecution of marijuana-related offenses is a heightened DOJ priority. Furthermore, the Sessions Memorandum explicitly describes itself as a guide to prosecutorial discretion. Such prosecutorial discretion remains in the hands of U.S. Attorneys when deciding whether or not to prosecute marijuana-related offenses.
 On November 7, 2018, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned as U.S. Attorney General. On February 14, 2019, William Barr was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as the next Attorney General. During one of his Senate confirmation hearings, Mr. Barr stated that he did not support cannabis legalization but would not prosecute cannabis businesses that comply with state laws. Mr. Barr stated further that he would not upset settled expectations that have arisen as a result of the Cole Memorandum.
 On March 11, 2021, Merrick Garland was appointed U.S. Attorney General. Mr. Garland indicated he would generally act in accordance with the Cole Memorandum, when, at his confirmation hearing, he said, “It does not seem to me a useful use of limited resources that we have, to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise.” He has not, however, reissued the Cole Memorandum or issued substitute guidance. While enforcement of federal laws against regulated state entities does not appear to be a U.S. DOJ priority, the U.S. DOJ may change its enforcement policies at any time, with or without advance notice.
 For the reasons set forth herein, TerrAscend’s existing investments in the United States, and any future investments, may become the subject of heightened scrutiny by regulators, stock exchanges and other authorities in Canada. As a result, TerrAscend may be subject to significant direct and indirect interaction with public officials. There can be no assurance that this heightened scrutiny will not lead to the imposition of certain restrictions on TerrAscend’s ability to invest in the United States or any other jurisdiction. Government policy changes or public opinion may also result in a significant influence over the regulation of the marijuana industry in the United States or elsewhere. A negative shift in the public’s perception of marijuana in the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction could affect future legislation or regulation. Among other things, such a shift could cause state and local jurisdictions to abandon initiatives or proposals to legalize medical or recreational marijuana, thereby limiting the number of new state jurisdictions into which TerrAscend could expand. Any inability to fully implement TerrAscend’s expansion strategy may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Additionally, under United States federal law, it may be a violation of federal money laundering statutes for financial institutions to take any proceeds from the sale of marijuana or any other Schedule I controlled substance. Banks and other financial institutions, particularly those that are federally chartered in the United States, could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to marijuana businesses. It may also be a violation of federal money laundering statutes for “federal health care law violations,” which include violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”).
 Violations of any U.S. federal laws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings conducted by either the federal government or private citizens, or criminal charges, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities, civil forfeiture or divestiture. This could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend, including its reputation and ability to conduct business, its marijuana licenses in the United States, the listing of its securities on various stock exchanges, its financial position, operating results, profitability or liquidity or the market price of its publicly traded shares. In addition, it is difficult for TerrAscend to estimate the time or resources that would be needed for the investigation of any such matters or its final resolution because, in part, the time and resources that may be needed are dependent on the nature and extent of any information requested by the applicable authorities involved, and such time or resources could be substantial. For the reasons set forth above, TerrAscend’s investments and operations in the United States may become the subject of heightened scrutiny by regulators, stock exchanges and other authorities in Canada.


TerrAscend may also be subject to a variety of laws and regulations domestically and in the United States that relate to money laundering, financial recordkeeping and proceeds of crime, including the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (commonly known as the Bank Secrecy Act), as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (Canada), as amended and the rules and regulations thereunder, the Criminal Code (Canada) and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the United States and Canada. Further, under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a marijuana business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be found guilty of money laundering, aiding and abetting, or conspiracy.
 In February 2014, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department issued a memorandum (the “FinCEN Memorandum”) providing instructions to banks seeking to provide services to marijuana-related businesses. The FinCEN Memorandum clarifies how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act obligations. It refers to supplementary guidance that Deputy Attorney General Cole issued to federal prosecutors relating to the prosecution of money laundering offenses predicated on marijuana-related violations of the CSA and independently lists the federal government’s enforcement priorities as related to marijuana. Although the original FinCEN Memorandum is still in place, this supplementary Department of Justice guidance that accompanied the FinCEN Memorandum was rescinded when former Attorney General Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum. It is unclear whether the current administration will follow the guidelines of the FinCEN Memorandum, although immediately after the Sessions Memorandum, then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated that the Treasury Department had no intention to rescind the FinCEN Memorandum but, instead, wanted to improve the availability of banking services in the state-regulated marijuana space. The position of current Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is relatively unknown. In the foreseeable future, TerrAscend expects any amounts payable by TerrAscend from its subsidiaries to remain in the United States to fund the further development of its businesses. TerrAscend may also consider future debt or equity financings.
 H.R. 1595, the SAFE Banking Act of 2019, which would expand financial services in the United States to marijuana-related legitimate businesses and service providers, was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives (the “House”) on March 7, 2019 with bipartisan support. On April 11, 2019, S. 1200, the U.S. Senate (the “Senate”) version of the SAFE Banking Act, was filed. This bill also has bipartisan support and more than a fifth of the total Senate, 27 members, co-sponsored it. On September 25, 2019, H.R. 1595 passed in the House by a vote of 321 to 103, but it stalled in the U.S. Senate. The SAFE Banking Act passed the House again on May 15, 2020, when it was included in the COVID-19 stimulus bill, the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act. However, that measure also stalled in the Senate. The SAFE Banking Act passed the House again on April 19, 2021 as H.R. 1996, by a vote of 321 – 101. The bill was received by the Senate and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, where it remained. On September 23, 2021, the House approved the National Defense Authorization Act (“NDAA”) that contained the provisions of the SAFE Banking Act. The SAFE Banking Act was subsequently removed from the NDAA by the House-Senate conference committee on December 7, 2021, and was not included in the final version of the NDAA. On February 4, 2022, the House passed the America COMPETES Act of 2022, which included the provisions of the SAFE Banking Act. The legislation has yet to be affirmed by the Senate.
Other legislation that has been introduced in the United States that would make cannabis transactions easier and more predictable, include the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (the “MORE Act”) and the Cannabis Administration and Opportunities Act (the “CAOA”). The MORE Act was first introduced in July 2019 by Representative Jerrold Nadler in the House, and in the Senate by then-U.S. Senator Kamala Harris. If it were to become law, the MORE Act would remove cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA and make available U.S. Small Business Administration funding for regulated cannabis operators. The MORE Act was reintroduced in the current U.S. Congress (“Congress”) by Representative Nadler on May 28, 2021, with no corresponding bill introduced in the Senate. The CAOA was released as a discussion draft by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, and U.S. Senator Cory Booker in July 2021. If it were to become law it would, among other things, remove cannabis from the definition of a controlled substance under the CSA, allow states to set their own regulations for cannabis, and block states from prohibiting interstate commerce of regulated cannabis across their borders. Recently introduced into Congress is another bill, the States Reform Act (“SRA”), introduced by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC), which would repeal the federal prohibition of cannabis.
Despite the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, one legislative safeguard for the medical marijuana industry remains in place. Congress has used a rider known as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment in the fiscal year 2015, 2016 and 2017 Consolidated Appropriations Acts (the “RBA”) to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal marijuana laws against regulated medical marijuana actors operating in compliance with state and local law. However, this measure does not protect adult-use marijuana businesses. As part of the $1.3 trillion federal spending bill enacted on March 23, 2018, Congress renewed the RBA through September 2018, and subsequently extended it further. The RBA is an appropriations rider that prohibits the DOJ from using federal funds to prevent states from implementing marijuana laws. The U.S. Ninth Circuit in United States v. McIntosh held that the prohibition under the RBA also prevents the DOJ from

spending federal funds to prosecute individuals who are engaged in conduct that is permitted by, and in compliance with, state medical marijuana laws.
State-Level Overview
 The following section presents an overview of market and regulatory conditions for the marijuana industry in U.S. states in which TerrAscend has or is intending to have an operating presence and is presented as of the date of filing, unless otherwise indicated.
 California
  In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 215, also known as the Compassionate Use Act, allowing physicians to recommend cannabis for an inclusive set of qualifying medical conditions including chronic pain. The law established a not-for-profit patient/caregiver system but there was no state licensing authority to oversee the businesses that emerged as a result of the system. In September of 2015, the California legislature passed three bills, collectively known as the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act. In 2016, California voters passed The Adult Use of Marijuana Act, which legalized recreational use cannabis for adults 21 years of age and older and created a licensing system for commercial cannabis businesses. Note, California defines “cannabis” to mean “marijuana.” On June 27, 2017, then-Governor Jerry Brown signed Senate Bill 94 into law, which combined California’s medicinal and recreational use cannabis frameworks into one licensing structure under the Medicinal and Adult-Use of Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MAUCRSA”).
 Pursuant to MAUCRSA: (i) CalCannabis, a division of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, was designated to issue licenses to cannabis cultivators: (ii) the Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch (the “MCSB”), a division of the California Department of Public Health, was designated to issue licenses to cannabis manufacturers; and (iii) the California Department of Consumer Affairs, via its agency the Bureau of Cannabis Control (the “BCC”), was designated to issue licenses to cannabis distributors, testing laboratories, retailers, and micro-businesses. These agencies were also charged with overseeing various aspects of implementing and maintaining California’s cannabis landscape, including the statewide track and trace system. All three agencies released their initial emergency rulemakings at the end of 2017 and updated them with minor revisions in June 2018. The three agencies adopted their permanent rulemakings on January 16, 2019. All three agencies began issuing temporary licenses in January 2018 and stopped doing so on December 31, 2018, pursuant to MAUCRSA.
 Local authorization is a prerequisite to obtaining a state license, and local governments are permitted to prohibit or otherwise regulate the types and number of cannabis businesses allowed in their locality. All three state regulatory agencies require confirmation from the applicable locality that the operator is operating in compliance with local requirements and was granted authorization to continue or commence commercial cannabis operations within the locality’s jurisdiction. Applicants are required to comply with all local zoning and land use requirements and provide written authorization from the property owner where the commercial cannabis operations are proposed to take place, which must dictate that the applicant has the property owner’s authorization to engage in the specific state-sanctioned commercial cannabis activities proposed to occur on the premises. The State has not set a limit on the number of state licenses an entity may hold, unlike other states that have restricted how many cannabis licenses an entity may hold in total or for various types of cannabis activity. Although vertical integration across multiple license types is allowed under MAUCRSA, testing laboratory licensees may not hold any other licenses aside from a laboratory license. There are also no residency requirements for ownership of a state license under MAUCRSA.
 California state licenses, and some local licenses, are renewed annually. Each year, licensees are required to submit a state renewal application to the relevant regulatory authority, and all applicable local renewal applications to the applicable local regulatory body (for local licenses) such as the Department of Cannabis Regulation in the City of Los Angeles.
 On July 12, 2021, Governor Gavin Newsom signed AB-141 into law, triggering the consolidation of CalCannabis, the MCSB, and the BCC into the newly created Department of Cannabis Control (the “DCC”). The DCC was created in an effort to centralize regulatory authority and facilitate a more easily navigable regulatory regime. All licenses obtained under the previous regulatory authorities automatically transferred to the DCC, which will be responsible for issuing and renewing all cannabis licenses moving forward. In September 2021 the DCC issued emergency regulations, which were approved and went into effect the same month. The emergency regulations, among other things, include revised definitions clarifying who are considered to be owners or holders of a financial stake in cannabis businesses, and provisions allowing for the sale of branded products between businesses.
 California’s robust regulatory system is designed to ensure, monitor, and enforce compliance with all aspects of a cannabis operator’s licensed operations. California’s state license application process additionally requires comprehensive criminal, regulatory, financial and personal disclosures, coupled with stringent monitoring and continuous reporting requirements designed to ensure only good actors are granted licenses and that licensees continue to operate in compliance with the state

regulatory program. Applicants must submit standard operating procedures describing how the operator will, among other requirements, secure the facility, manage inventory, comply with the state’s seed-to-sale tracking requirements, dispense cannabis, and handle waste, as applicable to the license sought. Once licensed, an operator must continue to abide by the processes described in its application and seek regulatory approval before any changes to such procedures can be made. Licensees are additionally required to train their employees on compliant operations and are only permitted to transact with other legal and licensed businesses.
 As a condition of state licensure, operators must consent to random and unannounced inspections of their commercial cannabis facility as well as all of the facility’s books and records, so as to monitor and enforce compliance with state law. Many localities have also enacted similar standards for inspections, and the state has already commenced site-visits and compliance inspections for operators who have received state temporary or annual licensure.
 New Jersey
 On January 18, 2010, the Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act (the “CUMMA”) came into force allowing patients with a limited number of qualifying medial conditions to access the state’s medical marijuana program. The New Jersey Department of Health (the “NJDOH”) issued regulations shortly thereafter authorizing the NJDOH to accept applications for a minimum of six alternative treatment centers (the “ATCs”), with two each to operate in the north, central and south regions of New Jersey.
 CUMMA permits each ATC to operate as both a cultivator and dispensary under one permit. These activities can take place at up to two locations, as long as both locations are within the same region. The application process involves two stages. Those seeking an ATC permit must first submit an application seeking authority to apply for a permit to operate. Upon the granting of the application, the prospective ATC must then complete the application for actual permitting. Applications for authority to apply for a permit may only be submitted following solicitation from NJDOH for such applications. The first six permits for ATCs were awarded to nonprofit entities, with subsequent permits to be available to both nonprofit and for-profit entities. In 2013, CUMMA was amended to allow ATCs to cultivate an unlimited number of strains of marijuana and sell additional marijuana-infused products, and to restrict the same of marijuana-infused edible products to qualifying patients under the age of 18. With additional authorizations, ATCs may also house manufacturing facilities for marijuana-infused products such as syrups and lozenges. All marijuana is subject to a tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) limit of 10%, though NJDOH is proposing to repeal the regulation that establishes this limit.
 Upon taking office on January 16, 2018, Governor Murphy expanded the medical program by issuing Executive Order No. 6, which ordered a 60-day review of all aspects of New Jersey’s current program, “with a focus on ways to expand access to marijuana for medical purposes.” In response to Executive Order No. 6, NJDOH released its EO 6 Report on March 23, 2018, which proposed significant changes to the existing medicinal program. In an effort to create greater patient access, the state immediately put into effect some of the recommended changes, including cutting registration and renewal fees, and expanding qualifying conditions.
 On July 16, 2018, the Murphy Administration announced that the licensing application process would be opened for up to six additional vertically integrated medicinal marijuana ATCs. The NJDOH released a Notice of Request for Applications outlining the reason for issuing the licenses, eligibility rules and information required for the applications. The application period opened on August 1, 2018 and closed on August 31, 2018. Winning applicants were supposed to be selected on or before November 1, 2018 but this deadline was subsequently pushed to December due to administrative constraints. On December 17, 2018, NJDOH revealed the additional six medical marijuana ATCs it picked to add to the program. New Jersey will now have 12 vertically-integrated ATCs across the state, if these additional six applicant ATCs become operational. These six applicant ATCs now must pass background checks, provide evidence of cultivation and dispensary locations with municipal approval for each location, and comply with all regulations promulgated by the NJDOH, including safety and security requirements.
 On March 25, 2019, a planned vote on legislative package including medical expansion and adult-use legalization was pulled due to a lack of votes necessary to pass the legislation through the state Senate. This setback came after significant momentum had helped to pass the bill through the appropriations and judiciary committees earlier in the month. After the package of cannabis reforms stalled, Governor Murphy announced he would be expanding the medical program through administrative action. This announcement has proved contentious as the Senate President claims any regulatory changes for medical cannabis would make securing the votes necessary to pass adult-use legalization more difficult. On May 14, 2019, the Senate President announced he would no longer work to advance adult-use legalization through the legislature and instead would pivot to put the issue before voters for the 2020 general election. While legalization stalled, bills to expand the state’s medical program and reform criminal penalties continued to move forward. On December 18, 2020, Governor Murphy signed A. 5981/S. 4154 into law, which facilitates the expungement of low-level marijuana crimes and other offenses. And, on November 3, 2020, New Jersey voters passed a ballot measure amending the New Jersey Constitution to permit the use of marijuana for adults over 21 years of age. The ballot measure will also allow New Jersey to regulate the growth, distribution, and sale of adult-use marijuana.

On November 4, 2020, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal issued a statement reminding New Jersey residents that the state’s criminal laws related to marijuana still apply until the state legislature enacts a framework for adult-use cannabis.
 On February 22, 2021, Governor Murphy signed the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act (“CREAMMA”) into law, legalizing the use of marijuana by adults 21 years of age and older in New Jersey. On August 19, 2021, New Jersey’s Cannabis Regulatory Commission (“CRC”) published its first set of rules associated with adult-use cannabis in the state. These rules outline the details of licensing, the authority of municipalities, the operations of cannabis businesses, and the CRC’s authority over adult-use cannabis. Adult-use sales in New Jersey commenced on April 21, 2022.
Pennsylvania
 The Pennsylvania medical marijuana program was signed into law on April 17, 2016 under Act 16 and provided access to state residents with one or more of 17 qualifying conditions, including: epilepsy, chronic pain and PTSD. The state originally awarded only 12 licenses to cultivate/process and 27 licenses to operate retail dispensaries (which entitled holders to up to three medical dispensary locations per retail license).
 On March 22, 2018, it was announced that the final phase of the Pennsylvania medical marijuana program would initiate its rollout, which included 13 additional cultivation/processing licenses and 23 additional dispensary licenses. Additionally, the list of qualifying conditions was expanded from 17 to 21. On July 20, 2019, two more qualifying medical conditions were added, bringing the total to 23.
 There are two principal license categories in Pennsylvania: (1) cultivation/processing and (2) dispensary. All cultivation/processing establishments and dispensaries must register with Pennsylvania Department of Health. Registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to annual renewals after required fees are paid and the business remains in good standing. The Pennsylvania Department of Health must renew a permit unless it determines the applicant is unlikely to maintain effective control against diversion of medical cannabis and the applicant is unlikely to comply with all laws as prescribed under the Pennsylvania medical marijuana program.
 Under applicable laws, the licenses permit the license holder to cultivate, manufacture, process, package, sell and purchase medical marijuana pursuant to the terms of the licenses, which are issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Health under the provisions of Medical Marijuana Act and Pennsylvania regulations. The medical cultivation/processing licenses permit the licensee to acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture/process into medical marijuana products and/or medical marijuana-infused products, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply or sell marijuana and related supplies to medical marijuana dispensaries.
 The retail dispensary licenses permit TerrAscend to purchase marijuana and marijuana products from cultivation/processing facilities, as well as allow the sale of marijuana and marijuana products.
 Maryland
 The Maryland medical cannabis program was signed into law on May 2, 2013. In 2016, the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission issued preliminary licenses to 102 dispensaries, 15 cultivators, and 15 processors; the first dispensaries opened to patients in December 2017.
 Maryland has three classes of cannabis licenses: dispensaries, cultivators, and processors. Wholesaling occurs between cultivators and processors, cultivators and dispensaries, and processors and dispensaries. Originally, no one Company could directly control multiple licenses of the same class, but this restriction was changed in May 2019 when Governor Hogan signed a bill that permitted a single company to own or control, including the power to manage or operate, up to four dispensaries. Dispensary locations are tied to the Senate District in which they were awarded, with the exception of dispensary licenses that were awarded to applicants who also were awarded a cultivation license. These dispensaries can be located at the discretion of the license holder. Permitted products include oil-based formulations, flower, and edibles.
 In April 2018, the Maryland House and Senate approved a bill, which was later signed by Governor Hogan, that expanded the license pool, allowing for a maximum of seven additional cultivation licenses, for a total of 22, and 13 additional processing licenses, for a total of 28. As of March 1, 2022, there were approximately 95 licensed dispensaries, 18 licensed cultivators, and 19 licensed processors. In November 2022, the voters in Maryland approved adult-use cannabis as a ballot question. Beginning on July 1, 2023, adults 21 or older may possess and consume up to 1.5 ounces of cannabis flower, 12 grams of concentrated cannabis, or a total amount of cannabis products that does not exceed 750 mg THC. This amount is known as the "personal use amount." Adult-use sales are expected to begin around the same time.

Michigan
 In November 2008, Michigan residents approved the Michigan Compassionate Care Initiative to provide a legal framework for individuals with certain debilitating medical conditions to lawfully use marijuana for medicinal purposes. In September 2016, the Michigan Legislature passed, and Governor Snyder signed into law, the Medical Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act (the “MMFLA”) and the Marihuana Tracking Act (the “MTA”) to provide a comprehensive licensing and tracking scheme, respectively, for state’s medical marijuana program.
 In 2018, Michigan voters approved Proposal 1, to make marijuana legal under state and local law for adults 21 years of age or older and to control the commercial production and distribution of marijuana under a system that licenses, regulates, and taxes the businesses involved. The proposal is known as the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act (the “MRTMA” and together with the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act (the “MMMA”), the MMFLA, and the MTA, the “Michigan Cannabis Laws”).
 Additionally, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (“LARA”) and the MRA have supplemented the Michigan Cannabis Laws with administrative rules and bulletins to further clarify the regulatory landscape surrounding the state’s medical and adult use marijuana programs. The MRA is the main regulatory authority for the licensing and regulation of medical and adult use marijuana businesses, and is an agency within LARA.
 Under the MMFLA, the MRA administrates five types of “state operating licenses” for medical marijuana businesses: (a) a “grower” license, including three different classes of licenses: (i) a Class A license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 500 plants; (ii) a Class B license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 1,000 plants; and (iii) a Class C license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 1,500 plants, (b) a “processor” license, (c) a “secure transporter” license, (d) a “provisioning center” license and (e) a “safety compliance facility” license. Likewise, under the MRTMA, the MRA administers six types of “state licenses” for adult use marijuana business: (a) a “marihuana grower” license, including three different classes of licenses: (i) a Class A license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 100 plants; (ii) a Class B license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 500 plants; and (iii) a Class C license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 2,000 plants, (b) a “marihuana processor” license, (c) a “secure transporter” license, (d) a “marihuana retailer” license, (e) a “marihuana safety compliance facility” license, and (f) a “marihuana microbusiness” license. However, MRTMA also allows the MRA to create additional license types through the administrative rulemaking process. To date, the MRA has created four additional license types: (a) a “designated consumption establishment” license, (b) an “excess marihuana grower” license, (c) a “marihuana event organizer” license, and (d) a “temporary marihuana event” license. Importantly, each excess marihuana grower license allows an entity that holds five adult use Class C grower licenses issued under MRTMA and at least two medical Class C grower licenses issued under the MMFLA to grow an additional 2,000 plants.
 Under both MRTMA and the MMFLA, there are no stated limits on the number of licenses that can be made available on a state level; however, the MRA has discretion over the approval of applications and municipalities can pass additional restrictions, including limiting the number and type of licenses that can be issued within their jurisdiction. Additionally, a person or entity cannot possess or own both a grower/process/provisioning center and a secure transporter license or a safety compliance lab.
 On February 11, 2022, Governor Whitmer signed an Executive Reorganization Order (ERO) 2022-1 which modified the Marijuana Regulatory Agency (MRA) to be called the Cannabis Regulatory Agency (CRA). This allowed for the CRA to have authority over Michigan's hemp processors and handlers under the Industrial Hemp Research and Development Act also shifting to the new CRA.
U.S. Hemp Regime
 The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly known as the “2018 Farm Bill”) was signed into law on December 20, 2018. The 2018 Farm Bill, among other things, removed “hemp” (including any part of the cannabis plant containing 0.3% THC or less), its extracts, derivatives, and cannabinoids from the CSA definition of “marihuana”, and allows for federally-sanctioned hemp production under the purview of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”), in coordination with state departments of agriculture that elect to have primary regulatory authority. States and Tribal governments can adopt their own regulatory plans, even if more restrictive than federal regulations, so long as the plans meet minimum federal standards and are approved by the USDA. Hemp production in jurisdictions that do not choose to submit their own plans (and that do not otherwise prohibit hemp production) will be governed by USDA regulation. “Hemp” as defined in the 2018 Farm Bill, “means the plant Cannabis sativa L., and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not with a THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis.”


While the 2018 Farm Bill removes hemp and hemp-derived products from the controlled substances list under the CSA, it does not legalize cannabidiol (“CBD”) in every circumstance. While not independently scheduled under the CSA, CBD, depending on the source from which it was derived and its THC concentration, can still be classified as a Schedule I substance under the CSA’s definition of “marihuana.” Further, although the 2018 Farm Bill creates a limited exception to this prohibition, this exception only applies if the CBD is derived from “hemp” as defined in federal law. Federal law also requires that: (i) the hemp is produced by a Licensed Producer; and (ii) in a manner consistent with the applicable federal and state regulations. CBD and other cannabinoids produced from marihuana as defined by the CSA remain an illegal Schedule I substance under federal law. In addition, many state laws include all CBD within definitions of marijuana and some states have policies or laws that otherwise prohibit or restrict CBD sales.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 2018 Farm Bill expressly preserves the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s authority to regulate certain products under the FDCA and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. The FDA takes the position that because CBD was the subject of substantial clinical investigations that have been made public and is the active ingredient in an FDA-approved drug (Epidiolex), it is therefore illegal to add to food and CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition. While there is an exception for articles that were marketed as a conventional food or dietary supplement before the new drug investigations were authorized (or the new drug was approved), the FDA has asserted that, based on available evidence, the exception does not apply to CBD. As previously mentioned, the FDA takes the position that it is unlawful under the FDCA to introduce food containing added CBD into interstate commerce, or to market CBD products as, or in, dietary supplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived. Despite FDA’s stated position, the agency has not, to date, been active in its CBD-related enforcement absent CBD products bearing aggressive therapeutic claims (e.g., claims of treatment of COVID-19, neuropathy, AIDS, diabetes, cancer, etc.). FDA could change its enforcement priorities at any time. The FDA has indicated that it will work towards providing ways for companies to seek approval from the FDA to market CBD products. In addition, options remain available for the FDA to consider whether there are circumstances in which certain cannabis-derived compounds might be permitted in a food or dietary supplement. Importantly, notwithstanding the FDA’s stated position prohibiting sales of CBD containing-foods and dietary supplements, the FDA has authority to issue a regulation allowing the use of a pharmaceutical ingredient, such as CBD, in a food or dietary supplement, even if such pharmaceutical ingredient was not previously marketed as a food or dietary ingredient prior to the initiation of clinical drug trials. Timing regarding if or when FDA might issue such a regulation is unclear.
 States have also taken various approaches to the production and sale of hemp-derived food products. Many states have adopted the Uniform State Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which was created in 1984 by the Association of Food and Drug Officials (the “AFDO”), the primary organization for state food and drug officials. The AFDO’s model Uniform Act includes a provision to automatically incorporate changes to the FDCA into state law. However, there is some variation between state Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Acts both because not all states have adopted this provision, and because not all states have adopted the Uniform Act. States that have adopted the Uniform Act generally prohibit the use of CBD in food and dietary supplements due to the FDA’s lack of approval for such uses of the substance, discussed above. For example, Michigan (among other states) prohibits the use of CBD in retail food and beverage products because of the FDA’s stated position. Like FDA, some states, despite having stated positions of the impermissibility of CBD foods and supplements, or any CBD products at all, enforcement is inconsistent, with some state regulators more active than others. Again, these enforcement priorities could change at any time.
 Although hemp-derived CBD cannot be added or marketed in foods or dietary supplements, certain hemp derived substances, such as hemp seed oil, may be permissible in food, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and other products depending on whether the ingredients and finished products comply with the other requirements of the FDCA. For example, a substance that will be added to food is subject to premarket approval by the FDA unless it is generally recognized, among qualified experts, to be safe under the conditions of its intended use (“GRAS”). Pursuant to the FDCA, a food ingredient may be marketed in the United States under any of the following three alternative criteria: (i) if it was approved by the FDA or USDA between 1938 and 1958 for the intended use (commonly referred to as a “prior sanction”); (ii) if it is GRAS for its intended use; or (iii) pursuant to a food additive regulation promulgated by the FDA. On December 20, 2018, the FDA issued GRAS approvals for three ingredients that are derived from parts of the cannabis plant that do not contain THC or CBD – hulled hemp seeds, hemp seed protein, and hemp seed oil. These three types of products can be legally marketed in human foods without food additive approval, provided they comply with all other requirements and do not make unlawful drug claims. It is worth noting that none of these GRAS products contain CBD.
 The 2018 Farm Bill also contemplates a significant state presence in the regulation of hemp production, as the 2018 Farm Bill empowers states, U.S. territories and Native American tribes to regulate the production and sale of hemp within their respective borders. To regulate commercial hemp production, states, U.S. territories and Native American tribes must submit plans to the USDA setting out the processes associated with how the state, territory or tribe will regulate hemp production, including how it will gather information, test, inspect and dispose of hemp and its related byproducts. The Secretary of the USDA must approve or reject these plans within sixty days of receipt. If a state, territory or tribe chooses not to submit a plan to the USDA, potential producers will be able to apply directly to the USDA for licensing approval. States, territories and tribes may also

enact stricter laws than those enacted at the federal level and may ban hemp production and sale within their respective jurisdiction.
 Once implemented, in jurisdictions with USDA-approved state programs, it will be a violation of state law to cultivate hemp without a registration in compliance with state law, or in the case of a state or territory without a USDA-approved program, it will be a violation of federal law to cultivate hemp without a federally issued license.
 The 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law on December 20, 2018. Importantly, however, the Industrial Hemp cultivation and research provisions contained in the Section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (the “2014 Farm Bill”) will remain in effect pending the USDA’s rulemaking process and certain provisions of the law may not yet be effective. The federal rulemaking process may take more than one year to finalize, and the 2014 Farm Bill will be repealed one year after the USDA establishes regulations governing hemp production in states lacking their own USDA-approved plans. The scope of the 2014 Farm Bill is limited to cultivation that is: (i) for research purposes (inclusive of market research, which multiple federal agencies have confirmed includes commercial sales with a research purpose); (ii) part of an “agricultural pilot program” or other agricultural or academic research; and (iii) permitted by state law. Further, the 2014 Farm Bill defines “Industrial Hemp” as the plant Cannabis sativa L., and any part of such plant, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis. The USDA published its final rule on January 19, 2021. The USDA’s final rule establishes a federal licensing plan for regulating U.S. hemp producers in states that do not have their own USDA-approved plans. In the absence of a state plan, U.S. hemp producers will be subject to regulation directly by the USDA unless the state prohibits U.S. hemp production. Additionally, the final rule includes requirements for maintaining information on the land where US hemp is produced, testing U.S. hemp for THC levels, disposing of plants with more than 0.3 percent THC on a dry-weight basis and licensing for U.S. hemp producers. The USDA’s final rule requires hemp producers to use a laboratory that is registered with the DEA, although the USDA is delaying enforcement of this requirement until December 31, 2022. The final rule also includes provisions for producers to dispose or remediate violative hemp plants without the use of a DEA-registered reverse distributor or law enforcement.
 State-Level Overview
 The following section presents an overview of market and regulatory conditions for the hemp industry in Florida, where the Company has an operating presence as of the date of this filing.
 Florida
 Florida continues to classify all cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance, except medical marijuana grown and sold under the state’s medical marijuana program and, as of July 1, 2019, both hemp and industrial hemp. Florida defines “cannabis” in its criminal code to include, “all parts of any plant of the genus cannabis, whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt derivative, mixture, or preparation of the plant or its seeds or resin.” The term does not include “marijuana,” if manufactured, possessed, sold, purchased, delivered, distributed, or dispensed, in conformance with § 381.986 Florida’s Medical Marijuana Program statutes. This term also does not include “hemp” defined in § 581.217 or “industrial hemp” as defined in § 1004.4473.
 On May 3, 2019, the Florida legislature passed SB1020, creating Florida’s hemp farming program governed by the Florida Department of Agriculture, legalizing cannabidiol and the sale and distribution of hemp extracts, and removing hemp and industrial hemp from the definition of cannabis under state law so that hemp is no longer a controlled substance in the state of Florida. On June 25, 2019, the bill was signed by the governor and went into on effect July 1, 2019. On April 16, 2020, Florida’s Hemp Plan was approved by USDA. Hemp cultivators may now apply for licensure online with the Florida Department of Agriculture. As part of the application, hemp cultivators must undergo a background check and must submit a Hemp Containment and Transportation Plan, among other requirements.
 Regulatory Framework in Canada
 Licenses and Regulatory Framework in Canada
 The TerrAscend Canada Licensed Producer License
 TerrAscend Canada held a standard cultivation license, standard processing license and license for sale for medical purposes under the Cannabis Act until February 9, 2023 when it opted to return its license. Under the Licensed Producer License, and subject to further requirements set out in the Cannabis Act, TerrAscend Canada was able to possess, obtain produce and sell cannabis, including sales of cannabis extracts, topicals and edibles, and oils, in accordance with the applicable Cannabis Regulations, subject to certain terms and conditions.
The Cookies Canada License
 TerrAscend's minority-owned business, Cookies Canada, has an interest in a retail operator's license under the Cannabis License Act (Ontario). The retail operator's license permits, subject to further requirements set out in the legislation, to possess and sell cannabis, including sales of cannabis extracts, topicals and edibles, and oils, in accordance with the applicable legislation and regulation, subject to certain terms and conditions, subject to certain restrictions on age and time of sale.
Summary of Canadian Regulatory Framework
 On October 17, 2018, the Cannabis Act and Cannabis Regulations came into force as law with the effect of legalizing the recreational adult-use of cannabis and regulating the production, distribution and sale of cannabis and cannabis derived products (both medical and adult-use) within Canada. The Cannabis Act replaced the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (“ACMPR”) and the Old International Health Regulations (“IHR”), both of which came into force under the CDSA, which previously permitted access to cannabis for medical purposes for only those Canadians who had been authorized to use cannabis by their health care practitioner.
 The Cannabis Act provides a licensing and permitting scheme for activities related to cannabis, implemented by regulations made under the Cannabis Act. The Cannabis Act maintains separate medical access to cannabis, including providing that import and export licenses and permits will only be issued in respect of cannabis for medical or scientific purposes or in respect of industrial hemp. Transitional provisions of the Cannabis Act provide that licenses and permits issued under the former ACMPR and the Narcotics Control Regulations (“NCR”) that were in force immediately before the day on which the Cannabis Act came into force are deemed to continue under the Cannabis Act.
 The Cannabis Regulations (the “Regulations”), among other things, outline the rules for the legal cultivation, processing, research, testing, distribution, sale, importation and exportation of cannabis and hemp in Canada, including the various classes of licenses that can be granted, and set standards for cannabis and hemp products. The Regulations include strict specifications for the plain packaging and labelling and analytical testing of all cannabis products as well as stringent physical and personnel security requirements for all federally licensed production and processing sites.
 The Cannabis Act and Regulations were amended on October 17, 2019 to provide for new classes of cannabis, namely edible cannabis, cannabis extracts and cannabis topicals, that are permitted to be sold in the medical and adult-use markets as well as to establish new regulatory controls to address the public health and safety risks associated with these new classes of cannabis. These controls include restrictions on product composition and ingredients, THC limits, and new requirements pertaining to promotion, packaging and labelling, good production practices and record keeping.
 Pursuant to the Cannabis Act, subject to provincial regulations, individuals over the age of 18 are able to purchase fresh cannabis, dried cannabis, cannabis oil, cannabis extracts, cannabis topicals, edible cannabis and cannabis plants or seeds and are able to legally possess up to 30 grams of dried cannabis or equivalent. In addition, the Cannabis Act provides provincial, territorial and municipal governments the authority to prescribe regulations regarding retailing and distribution, as well as the ability to alter some of the existing baseline requirements of the Cannabis Act such as increasing the minimum age for purchase and consumption, and limiting the ability of households to grow cannabis plants.
 The Cannabis Regulations establish requirements relating to licenses; security, including clearances; cannabis products; packaging, labelling and promotion, health products and cosmetics containing cannabis and cannabis for medical purposes.
 Cannabis Products
 Initially, the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations set out certain requirements for the sale of cannabis products at the retail level and initially permitted the sale of dried cannabis, cannabis oil, fresh cannabis, cannabis plants, and cannabis seeds, including in “pre-rolled” and capsule form, by authorized license holders.
 On October 17, 2019, the Federal Government legalized new classes of products; specifically, edible cannabis, cannabis extracts, and cannabis topical products pursuant to certain amendments to the Cannabis Act and Cannabis Regulations. The previous class, cannabis oil, was subject to a one year transition period to allow for existing cannabis license holders to transition their current products in order to comply with the amended Cannabis Regulations. Consequently, the Cannabis Act was amended with effect on October 17, 2020 to remove “cannabis oil” as a separate cannabis category from Schedule 4 of the Cannabis Act. Edible cannabis, cannabis extracts, and cannabis topical products, which are now available for sale, are subject to additional regulatory requirements that include supplemental marketing and advertising rules, further restrictions on labelling and packaging, rules relating to ingredients of edible cannabis and cannabis extracts, limits on THC content, and additional

manufacturing and good production practice requirements. In addition, the Cannabis Regulations require processing license holders to notify Health Canada at least sixty days prior to the intended release of a new product to the market.
 Advertising and Promotions
 The Cannabis Act, and the accompanying Cannabis Regulations, the Cannabis Licence Act (Ontario) and its accompanying regulations, contain strict restrictions on the promotion of cannabis products and generally prohibit the promotion of cannabis, cannabis accessories and services related to cannabis, unless the promotional activity is specifically authorized under the legislation and regulations. These prohibitions are intended to protect public health and safety, including protecting the health of young persons by restricting their access to cannabis and preventing the inducement of the use of cannabis, while allowing consumers to have access to information with which they can make informed decisions about the consumption of cannabis. Thus, the promotion, packaging and labelling, display and sale and distribution of cannabis and cannabis accessories takes place in a highly regulated environment which restricts the ability of operators to brand and market their store or products in a manner consistent with other industries which are not subject to such controls.
Provincial and Territorial Developments
 While the Cannabis Act provides for the regulation by the Federal Government of, among other things, the commercial cultivation and processing of cannabis and the sale of medical cannabis, it also provides that the provinces and territories of Canada have authority to regulate certain aspects of adult-use cannabis, such as distribution and sale, minimum age requirements, places where cannabis can be consumed, and a range of other matters.
 The governments of every Canadian province and territory have implemented their regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of cannabis for adult-use purposes. Most provinces and territories have announced a minimum age of 19 years old, except for Alberta, where the minimum age is 18, and Québec, where the minimum age is 21. A summary of the legislative framework in each province and territory is set out below.
 Ontario
 The distribution and sale of recreational cannabis in Ontario is primarily governed by the Cannabis Control Act, 2017, the Cannabis Licence Act, 2018 and the related regulations. The Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation is the wholesale distributor of cannabis and conducts all online sales in the province.
Compliance
 In the United States, TerrAscend is in compliance with all state laws and the related cannabis licensing framework of Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, California, and Michigan. In Canada, at the time of license return at the request of TerrAscend, TerrAscend was in compliance with all applicable federal, provincial and territorial laws and regulations, including the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations. There are no current incidences of noncompliance, citations or notices of violations outstanding which may have an impact on TerrAscend’s licenses, business activities or operations in these states. Notwithstanding the foregoing, like all businesses, TerrAscend may from time-to-time experience incidences of noncompliance with applicable rules and regulations in the states in which TerrAscend operates, and such non-compliance may have an impact on TerrAscend’s licenses, business activities or operations in the applicable states. However, TerrAscend takes steps to minimize, disclose and remedy all incidences of non-compliance which may have an impact on TerrAscend’s licenses, business activities or operations in all states in which TerrAscend operates.
