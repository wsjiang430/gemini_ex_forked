ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1969, and its wholly owned subsidiaries own and operate a fleet of oceangoing vessels engaged in the transportation of crude oil and petroleum products in the U.S. Flag trade. At December 31, 2022, the Company owned or operated a fleet of 21 vessels totaling an aggregate of approximately 1.5 million dwt. Additional information about the Company’s fleet, including its ownership profile, is set forth under “Fleet Operations— Fleet Summary,” as well as on the Company’s website, www.osg.com.
 
OSG primarily charters its vessels to customers for voyages for specific periods of time at fixed daily amounts through time charters. The Company also charters its vessels for specific voyages at spot rates. Spot market rates are highly volatile due to market forces, including local and worldwide demand for the commodities carried (such as crude oil or petroleum products), volumes of trade, distances that the commodities must be transported, the amount of available tonnage both at the time such tonnage is required and over the period of projected use, and the levels of seaborne and shore-based inventories of crude oil and refined products. Time charter rates provide more predictable streams of TCE revenues because they are fixed for specific periods of time. For a more detailed discussion on factors influencing spot and time charter markets, see “Fleet Operations—Commercial Management” below.
 
The Russia/Ukraine conflict has resulted in economic sanctions against Russia, including the banning or limitation of oil imports from Russia by certain countries and self-sanctioning by many oil companies and traders. In December 2022, the EU banned waterborne crude oil imports from Russia and the G7 nations implemented a price cap limiting the global price paid for Russian oil. Some countries have taken advantage of the current availability of Russian crude oil sold at a discount to world prices. These circumstances have resulted in the redirection of oil (crude and refined product) trade flows, which are apt to continue, reflecting the needs of countries that were large consumers of Russian oil to obtain other supply sources. Although the United States was not a major importer of Russian oil, it is impacted by these global events. Crude and refined products that were previously imported into the United States from non-Russian sources may not be available in prior quantities. Another potential impact is more movement from domestic producing locations via pipeline and marine assets, which would increase vessel demand. An increase in demand could result in higher utilization levels and potentially higher rates for Jones Act vessels.
 
Renewable diesel produces less carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide than conventional diesel. As it is chemically identical to regular diesel, it can be used on its own or blended with conventional diesel. Production of renewable diesel increased in 2022 and is expected to grow significantly by 2025 as governments implement policies to encourage further growth of this fuel, including California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard. The U.S. Gulf Coast currently produces a significant proportion of U.S renewable diesel, and California has been a large consumer of renewable diesel. Marine transportation provides the most cost-effective solution to move finished product to the West Coast. The length of the trip to California creates a significant increase in ton mile demand, creating a large new market for Jones Act shipping.
 
During the COVID-19 pandemic we placed seven vessels in layup in order to allow us to reduce the operating costs associated with vessels that were without charter. As demand returned, in the fall of 2021 we began to bring vessels out of layup and operate them in the spot market. In January 2022 and late February 2022, two more vessels came out of layup. We continued to see an increase in demand during the first half of 2022 and as a result, our last two vessels in layup returned to service in May 2022. During 2022, we started to see a resumption of more typical customer behavior, with charterers entering into longer term time charter agreements.
 
Strategy 
 
The key elements to our strategy to maximize stockholder value are to:
 

● | Generate strong cash flows by capitalizing on our leading Jones Act market position and long-standing customer relationships; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Combine the predictability of fixed time charter and contract revenues with opportunistic trading in the spot market; 
● | Actively manage the size and composition of our fleet to increase investment returns and available capital; 
● | Emphasize the quality of our operations and adhere to the highest safety and environmental standards attainable; and 
● | Seek opportunities to increase scale and drive cost efficiencies through a disciplined approach to investment in core and adjacent asset classes to maximize return on capital across market cycles.

--+---------------------------------


We believe we are well-positioned now and over the long term to generate strong cash flows. We currently operate one of the largest tanker fleets in the U.S. Flag market, with a strong presence in all major U.S. coastwise trades. Our market position allows us to maintain long-standing relationships with many of the largest energy companies, which in some cases date back many decades. We consider attaining stability of cash flow through medium-term charters and COAs to be a fundamental objective of our chartering approach. This is especially observable in the niche businesses within which many of our assets operate. Recent years have seen a marked increase in market volatility as the demand drivers for domestic transportation of crude oil and its refined product have been impacted by market disruptions, increased export flows, the ascendency of trading desks in intermediating supply chain logistics, and emerging trades for renewable fuels and their feedstocks. These changes have affected most directly our conventional tankers, which witnessed depressed market conditions during much of 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic before experiencing a rebound in demand in 2022. Considerations about the appropriate overall exposure to these more volatile markets and the amount of that capacity to remain active in the spot market are regular management discussion points. Balancing time charter coverage with spot market exposure in an environment of ever-changing demand signals presents a persistent challenge. Recent market conditions have created favorable conditions for extending the breadth and duration of time charter coverage amongst our conventional tankers. However, under other market conditions, a policy of entering into medium-term charters may not be profitable or prove achievable. As such, during future periods of uncertainty, it is likely that more of our vessels will be exposed to the more volatile and less predictable spot market with a corresponding impact on the amount of revenue our vessels may earn.
 
In addition, the future of seaborne energy transportation and the type, design and markets for vessels that will be engaged in this business are evolving in ways not yet well defined. While this evolution may impose additional risks and uncertainties on OSG’s existing business lines, the progressive transformation away from a carbon fuels-based economy could present interesting new business niches for OSG to competitively apply its differentiated set of skills. Participating in a broader spectrum of opportunities in the existing and emerging markets for energy and liquid bulk commodities of all types will remain a focus of the Company as the solution set to these complex problems becomes clearer.
 
We believe that OSG has good standing in the community of our customers, our peers and our regulators, with a long- established reputation for maintaining the highest standards in both protecting the environment and maintaining the health and safety of all of our employees. Continued improvement in these areas is important not only to the constituents directly affected, but equally as important in sustaining a key differentiating competitive factor amongst the customers we serve.
 
We actively manage the size and composition of our fleet through opportunistic acquisitions and dispositions of vessel assets as part of our effort to achieve attractive returns on capital. We consider timely and selective acquisition of high-quality secondhand vessels or new-build contracts when we believe those acquisitions will result in attractive returns on invested capital and increased cash flow. We may also engage in dispositions or repurposing of our vessel assets where we can achieve attractive values relative to their anticipated future earnings from operations. Taken together, we believe these activities will help us to maintain a diverse, high-quality and modern fleet of crude oil, refined product, and potentially other U.S. Flag vessels with an enhanced return on invested capital. We believe our versatile fleet, as well as our experience and our long-standing relationships with participants in the crude and refined product shipping industry, position us to take advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities in any vessel class in the U.S. Flag market.
 
Customers
 
OSG’s customers include major independent oil traders, refinery operators and U.S. and international government entities. The Company’s top two customers comprised 24.4% of shipping revenues during the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 2 - “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 for further information regarding the Company’s customers for 2022 and 2021.

(2) | Includes three crude oil tankers doing business in Alaska and one crude oil tanker bareboat chartered-in and in layup. 

 
On January 27, 2023, the Company’s one owned Marshall Island flagged non-Jones Act MR tanker, the Overseas Sun Coast, was officially documented as a U.S. Flag vessel, joining the rest of the Company’s U.S. Flag fleet.
 
In December 2022, the Company redelivered three conventional tankers leased from American Shipping Company. In addition, in December 2022, the Company exercised its option to extend the terms of six chartered-in vessels from December 2023 to December 2026.
 
Commercial Management
 
Time-Charter Market
 
The Company’s operating fleet includes a number of vessels that operate on time charters. Within a contract period, time charters provide a predictable level of revenues without the fluctuations inherent in spot-market rates. Once a time charter expires, however, the ability to secure a new time charter may be uncertain and subject to market conditions. Time charters constituted 70% of the Company’s shipping revenues in 2022, 71% in 2021, and 75% of the Company’s TCE revenues in 2022 and 73% in 2021.
Spot Market
 
Voyage charters and COAs constituted 30% of the Company’s shipping revenues in 2022, 29% in 2021, and 25% of the Company’s TCE revenues in 2022 and 27% in 2021. Accordingly, the Company’s shipping revenues are affected by prevailing spot rates for voyage charters in the markets in which the Company’s vessels operate. Spot market rates are highly volatile due to market forces, including local and worldwide demand for the commodities carried (such as crude oil or petroleum products), volumes of trade, distances that the commodities must be transported, the amount of available tonnage both at the time such tonnage is required and over the period of projected use, and the levels of seaborne and shore-based inventories of crude oil and refined products.
 
Seasonal trends affect oil consumption and consequently vessel demand. While trends in consumption vary with seasons, peaks in demand quite often precede the seasonal consumption peaks as refiners and suppliers try to anticipate consumer demand. The timing of peaks in oil demand vary within the markets in which we operate. Available tonnage is affected over time by the volume of newbuild deliveries, the number of tankers used to store clean products and crude oil, and the removal (principally through recycling or conversion) of existing vessels from service. Recycling is affected by the level of freight rates, recycling prices, vetting standards established by charterers and terminals and by U.S. governmental regulations that establish maintenance standards. Voyage charters include COAs on three vessels. Changes in the percentage contributions are therefore affected by Delaware Bay lightering volumes. In addition, as ships come off of their time charters, they may be forced into short-term trades.

Business Segment
 
The Company has one reportable business segment. At December 31, 2022, the Company’s 19 active vessel U.S. Flag fleet consisted of three crude oil tankers doing business in Alaska, two conventional ATBs, two lightering ATBs, three shuttle tankers, seven MR tankers, and two non-Jones Act MR tankers that participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program. The Company also owned and operated one Marshall Islands flagged MR tanker. On January 27, 2023, the Marshall Island flagged MR tanker was officially documented as a U.S. Flag vessel, joining the rest of the Company’s U.S. Flag fleet. Under the Jones Act, shipping between U.S. ports, including the movement of Alaskan crude oil to U.S. ports, is reserved for U.S. Flag vessels that satisfy Jones Act requirements, including requirements that vessels be constructed in the United States and owned by companies that are more than 75% owned and controlled by U.S. citizens. OSG is one of the largest commercial owners and operators of U.S. Flag vessels and participates in U.S. government programs, including the following:
 
Maritime Security Program—Two non-Jones Act U.S. Flag Product Carriers participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program, which is designed to ensure that militarily useful U.S. Flag vessels are available to the U.S. Department of Defense in the event of war or national emergency. Each participating vessel receives an annual stipend that is intended to offset the increased cost incurred by such vessels from operating under the U.S. Flag. Such stipend was $5,300 on one vessel and $3,952 on one vessel in 2022 and $5,250 for each vessel in 2021.
 
Under the terms of the program, the Company expects to receive up to $5,300 annually for each vessel during 2023. The Company does not receive a stipend with respect to any days for which a vessel operates under a time charter to a U.S. government agency.
 
The U.S. Tanker Security Program was enacted into law in 2021 and funded by Congress in 2022. The program is expected to be activated in 2023 and MARAD has been accepting applications. The program is designed to ensure that militarily useful U.S. Flag tank vessels are available to the U.S. Department of Defense in the event of war or national emergency. The initial program calls for 10 tankers to participate. Once the program is activated, the Company plans on transferring the two non-Jones Act U.S. Flag Product Carriers participating in the MSP program to the TSP program, which will result in a greater stipend received for each vessel.
 
OSG has seven Handysize product carriers in our U.S. Flag fleet that are chartered-in and provide for the payment of profit share to the owners of the vessels calculated in accordance with the respective charter-in agreements. Due to reserve funding requirements, no profits have yet been paid to the owners or are, based on management’s current forecast, expected to be paid to the owners in the current calendar year.
 
Technical Management
 
OSG’s fleet operations are managed in-house. In addition to regular maintenance and repair, crews onboard each vessel and shore side personnel must ensure that the Company’s fleet meets or exceeds regulatory standards established by the IMO and USCG.
 
The Company recruits, hires and trains the crews on its U.S. Flag vessels. The Company believes that its mandatory training and education requirements exceed the requirements of the USCG and that its ability to provide professional development for qualified U.S. Flag crew is necessary in a market where skilled labor shortages are expected to remain a challenge. The U.S. Flag fleet is supported by shore side staff that includes fleet managers, marine and technical superintendents, purchasing and marine insurance staff, crewing and training personnel and health, safety, quality and environmental (“SQE”) personnel.
 
Safety
 
The Company is committed to providing safe, reliable and environmentally sound transportation to its customers. Integral to meeting standards mandated by regulators and customers is the use of robust SMS by the Company. The SMS is a framework of processes and procedures that addresses a spectrum of operational risks associated with quality, environment, health and safety. The SMS is certified to the International Safety Management Code (“ISM Code”) promulgated by the IMO. To support a culture of compliance and transparency, OSG has an open reporting system on all of its vessels, whereby seafarers can anonymously report possible violations of OSG’s policies and procedures. All open reports are investigated, and appropriate actions are taken when necessary.

--+---------------------------------

HUMAN CAPITAL
 
Our employees are critical to meeting our commitments. Accordingly, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain experienced and qualified employees. We emphasize ethical behavior, respect, and equal opportunity by creating a culture of trust, accountability and empowerment. We also promote a shared sense of responsibility among OSG’s mariners and the shore-based support team in meeting the essential need to supply transportation fuels to the markets that we serve.
 
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 1,023 employees comprised of 945 seafarers and 78 shore side staff. The Company has collective bargaining agreements with three different U.S. maritime unions which, as of December 31, 2022, covered 769 of the seafarers employed on the Company’s vessels. These agreements are in effect for periods ending between March 2024 and June 2027. Under the collective bargaining agreements, the Company is obligated to make contributions to pension and other welfare programs. 
 
Compensation and Benefits Program. Our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our shareholders. We provide employees with competitive compensation packages that include base salary as well as employees benefits such as life and health (medical, dental and vision) insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave, and certain postretirement benefits.
 
Training and Education. Our seafarers are highly trained, with many officers having both USCG licenses as well as business or engineering degrees. Regardless of position, specialized training to work in the industry based on USCG requirements, as well as vessel-specific training within our fleet, is a necessity. Years of experience are required in order to move into higher levels of authority on our vessels. Our training and education programs are designed to address applicable regulations as well as the specific hazards and work environments of each of our vessels.
 
Health and Safety. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant operating environment changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, as required by government regulations. These included providing personal protective equipment, minimizing crew changes, managing the locations where crew members board and depart from our vessels, certifications by crew members to disclose symptoms and the health of those they have been in contact with, sanitization of the vessels, mandating face coverings, social distancing and temperature checks, and requiring testing and quarantining in certain instances. Protocols were developed with the coordination and assistance of the unions in order to provide consistency within the industry.
 
Having a well-maintained fleet is also critical to create an environment where our crew can work safely. Our fleets undergo regular and frequent surveys by classification societies and regulatory bodies as well as vettings by our customers on an ongoing basis. Issues identified are swiftly addressed. Our seafarers are encouraged to provide transparent reporting of issues in order to remedy conditions as soon as they are observed. We regularly conduct safety reviews to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and all policies and procedures.
 
COMPETITION
 
OSG’s primary competitors are operators of U.S. Flag oceangoing barges and tankers, operators of rail transportation for crude oil, and operators of refined product pipelines systems that transport refined petroleum products directly from U.S. refineries to domestic markets. In addition, indirect competition comes from International Flag vessels transporting imported refined petroleum products.
CYBER SECURITY
 
OSG has both on-shore and ship-board systems that are highly dependent on information technology systems. Loss, disruption, or compromise of these systems could significantly impact operations and results.

5 | Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.
--+---------------------------------


Our information technology controls are subject to audit by internal and external auditors, as well as the American Bureau of Shipping. OSG at least annually advises its Board of Directors on information security matters and provides user training and monitoring of system access as part of our compliance program. We have not experienced any material cyber security violation or occurrence over the last three years.
 
While we continue to invest time, effort and financial resources to secure our systems, networks and communications, our security measures cannot provide absolute assurance that we will be successful in preventing or responding to all cyber security attacks. There can be no assurance that any breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors-Interruption, failure or breach of OSG’s information technology and communications systems could impair its ability to operate and adversely affect its business.”
 
ENVIRONMENTAL, SAFETY AND SECURITY MATTERS 
 
OSG’s vessels operate in a highly regulated environment, subject to international conventions and international, national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the countries such vessels call upon. OSG’s vessels are registered in the United States and are subject to the jurisdictional and regulatory oversight of the USCG (under various protocols and agreements covering certain statutory survey and certification functions). OSG is also subject to compliance with several other U.S. government agency regulations, including the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the MARAD, and the United States Customs and Border Protection Agency. OSG vessels are classed with the American Bureau of Shipping (“ABS”) and are subject to the requirements of the Classification Society.
 
Industry-related incidents have historically heightened the level of environmental, health, safety and security awareness among various stakeholders, including insurance underwriters, regulators, and charterers, leading to increased regulatory requirements and more stringent inspection regimes on all vessels. In recognition of this heightened awareness, OSG has set appropriate internal controls intended to monitor regulatory developments and maintains operating standards designed to meet the higher expectations of our stakeholders. We have in place operational safety and quality, environmental stewardship, preventive planned maintenance, continuous training of our officers and crews, and compliance with international and United States regulations, including regular and rigorous in-house inspections and audits. In addition, a variety of governmental and private entities subject OSG’s vessels to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections, including the USCG, local port state control authorities, flag states, coastal states, Classification Societies, major oil companies and petroleum terminal operators.
 
OSG believes that the operation of its vessels complies with applicable environmental laws and regulations, which are summarized below, and has adopted plans, programs, and procedures in accordance with such laws and regulations. However, because such laws and regulations are changed frequently, and new laws and regulations impose new or increasingly stringent requirements, OSG cannot predict the cost of complying with requirements beyond those that are currently in force. The impact of future regulatory requirements on operations or the resale value or useful lives of its vessels may result in substantial additional costs in meeting new legal and regulatory requirements.

Regulations Preventing Pollution of Seas by Oil
 
The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”) Annex I addresses requirements for the prevention of pollution by oil and oily materials generated in the engine room and from the cleaning of cargo tanks, while MARPOL Annex II addresses requirements for the prevention of pollution by noxious liquid substances (“NLSs”).
 
The United States regulates the shipping industry with an extensive regulatory and liability regime for environmental protection, consisting primarily of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA 90”) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). OPA 90 requires Vessel Response Plans (“VRPs”), including marine salvage and firefighting plans, for reporting and responding to vessel emergencies and oil spill scenarios up to a worst-case scenario, as well as advance contracting, planning, and training to ensure that necessary private response resources are in place to immediately respond to a worst-case discharge or vessel emergency.
 
Under IMO regulations , OSG has adopted Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans (“SOPEPs”), including periodic training and drills for response personnel and for vessels and their crews and Shipboard Marine Pollution Emergency Plans (“SMPEPs”), which cover potential releases not only of oil but of any NLSs.
 
US Liability Standards and Limits
 
Under OPA 90, vessel owners, operators and bareboat or demise charterers are responsible parties who are liable, without regard to fault, for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages, including property and natural resource damages and economic loss without physical damage to property, arising from oil spills and pollution from their vessels. Additionally, the statute specifically permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes for oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. CERCLA contains a similar liability regime and provides for cleanup, removal, and natural resource damages associated with discharges of hazardous substances other than oil.
 
OPA 90 requires owners and operators of vessels to establish and maintain with the USCG evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the limit of their potential strict liability consistent with the limits of liability set forth in the statutes. OSG has provided the requisite proofs of financial security and has received Certificates of Financial Responsibility from the USCG. OSG carries various forms of marine insurance for each of its vessels, including pollution liability insurance in the amount of $1.0 billion. However, a catastrophic spill could exceed the insurance coverage available, in which event there could be a material adverse effect on OSG’s business.
 
International Liability Standards and Limits
 
Compensation for oil pollution damage caused by spills from oil tankers is governed by an international regime referred to as the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage. Under these conventions, a vessel’s registered owner is strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil, subject to certain defenses. These conventions also limit the liability of the shipowner under certain circumstances, except where the pollution damage results from its personal act or omission, is committed with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result. OSG believes that its protection and indemnity insurance will cover any liability under the plan adopted by the IMO.

7 | Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.
--+---------------------------------


The International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, 2001 is a separate convention adopted to ensure that adequate, prompt and effective compensation is available to persons who suffer damage caused by spills of oil when used as fuel by vessels. The convention applies to damage caused to the territory, including the territorial sea, and in its exclusive economic zones, of states that are party to it.
 
Regulations Preventing Pollution of Seas by Sewage or Garbage
 
MARPOL Annex IV, as well as U.S. regulations, regulate the discharge of sewage to sea. Sewage discharge is also subject to national and local regulations that set forth further restrictions, in some cases prohibiting the discharge of treated sewage and the establishment of No Discharge Zones (“NDZs”). OSG vessels are all equipped with Marine Sanitation Devices compliant with regulatory requirements for each type of vessel.
 
MARPOL Annex V, as well as U.S. regulations, regulates the prevention of pollution to sea by garbage and e-waste. 
 
Regulations Preventing Air Pollution 
 
MARPOL Annex VI (“Annex VI”) addresses air pollution from vessels, sets limits on sulfur oxide (“SOx”) and nitrogen oxide (“NOx”) emissions from ship exhausts, prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances (“ODS”) and regulates shipboard incineration and the emission of volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) from tankers. The global sulfur cap for ship operations was reduced in 2020 from 3.5% m/m to 0.5% m/m.
 
Vessels are subject to further air emission controls within Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”), and Sulfur Emission Control Areas (“SECAs”). Fuel used by vessels operating in or transiting through the ECA or SECA cannot exceed 0.1% m/m sulfur, with more stringent NOx emission Tier III emission limits applicable to engines installed on ships constructed after January 1, 2016. As these emission limits continue to evolve, compliance could impact fuel costs.
 
OSG operates one tanker equipped with an open-loop exhaust gas cleaning system (“EGCS”) designed to burn high-sulfur (3.5% maximum) bunker fuel to comply with the 0.5% sulfur limit. OSG has implemented all regulatory requirements associated with the use of EGCS, including switching over to 0.1% m/m sulfur fuel in ports that do not allow overboard discharge from open loop EGCS.
 

8 | Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.
--+---------------------------------


Annex VI includes energy efficiency standards for certain new ships through the designation of an Energy Efficiency Design Index (“EEDI”). The EEDI standards phase in through 2025 and are anticipated to result in significant reductions in fuel consumption as well as air and marine pollution. OSG’s fleet, as of December 31, 2022, includes one vessel under which the EEDI standards apply.
 
The EPA has implemented rules comparable to those of Annex VI to increase the control of air pollutant emissions from certain large marine engines by requiring certain new marine-diesel engines installed on U.S. built ships to meet lower NOx standards. EPA Tier 2 standards generally reduced NOx emissions by 27% and introduced a particulate matter (“PM”) limit. EPA Tier 3 standards represent a 50% reduction in PM and a 20% reduction in NOx over Tier 2 levels. EPA Tier 4 standards represent a 90% reduction in PM and 80% reduction in NOx compared to Tier 2 levels and generally require advanced technology such as selective catalytic reduction or exhaust gas recirculation. Adoption of these and emerging standards may require substantial modifications to some of OSG’s existing marine diesel engines and may require OSG to incur substantial capital expenditures if the engines are replaced.
 
The U.S. Clean Air Act (“CAA”) requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants and requires states to draft State Implementation Plans (“SIPs”) designed to attain national health-based air quality standards in major metropolitan and industrial areas. Several SIPs regulate emissions resulting from tank vessel loading and degassing operations by requiring the installation of vapor control equipment. OSG’s vessels are subject to vapor control and recovery requirements for certain cargoes when loading, unloading, ballasting, cleaning and conducting other operations in regulated port areas. All OSG’s vessels are equipped with vapor control systems that satisfy these requirements. Although a risk exists that new regulations could require significant capital expenditures and otherwise increase its costs, OSG believes, based upon the regulations that have been proposed to date, no material capital expenditures beyond those currently contemplated and no material increase in costs are likely to be required as a result of the SIPs program.
 
The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environment Control (“DNREC”) monitors OSG’s U.S. Flag lightering activities within the Delaware River through Title V of the Coastal Zone Act of 1972. OSG is the only marine operator with a Title V permit to engage in lightering operations. The regulations are designed to reduce the number of VOCs entering the atmosphere during a crude oil lightering operation through the use of vapor balancing. OSG’s Delaware Lightering fleet is 100% vapor balance capable.
 

International efforts to reduce air pollution
 
For decades, countries have sought to establish international cooperation to combat climate change and focus on implementing programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), which contribute to global warming, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Kyoto Protocol , the Paris Agreement, and more recently the Conference of Parties (COP27). The IMO has committed to developing limits on GHGs from international shipping and has implemented mandatory technical and operational measures to achieve these limits. Regional mandates in certain ports and territorial waters within the European Union (“EU”) seek to reduce SOx emissions by limiting sulfur content in fuel oils used by vessels.
 
The European Commission is developing options for the inclusion of international maritime transport in the GHG reduction commitment of the EU. The EU Monitoring, Reporting, Verification Regulation (“MRV”) creates an EU-wide framework for the monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon dioxide emissions from maritime transport and to collect and later publish verified annual data on carbon dioxide emissions. The United Kingdom (“UK”) implemented its own MRV, which requires the monitoring of UK-related voyages. OSG submits annual emissions reports for vessels subject to these MRV schemes.
 

9 | Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.
--+---------------------------------


Commencing January 1, 2024, the EU expects to implement an Emissions Trading Scheme (“ETS”) whereby vessels calling upon the EU will be required to surrender allowances each year for a portion of their CO2 emissions, including methane and nitrogen oxides, from incoming and outgoing global EU voyages, from ships performing voyages between EU ports of call, and at berth in an EU port, based on the following schedule:
 

● | 40% of verified emissions in 2024,

● | 100% of verified emissions in 2026. 

 
The EU is expected to further implement anti-evasion measures, which will include certain stops at non–EU ports within 300 nautical miles of the EU’s territory. A certain amount of the revenue from the EU’s auctions, which is how companies receive emission allowances, is to be allocated to the maritime sector to support innovation in low-carbon technologies and contribute to zero pollution objectives. OSG believes that this could have a material impact on voyages to and from the EU and plans to work with Charterers to offset associated impacts.
 
MARPOL Annex VI, which entered into force on November 22, 2022, introduced a new Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (“EEXI”) and a Carbon Intensity Indicator (“CII”) to be used for grading a ship’s CO2 emissions performance. Verification that a ship’s attained EEXI meets the minimum requirement will occur at the first survey for the IAPP Certificate that occurs after January 1, 2023. Each ship’s CII must then be calculated annually using IMO DCS data beginning in 2024 (based on 2023 data) and then assigned a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or E). A CII grade of “C” or better indicates the ship remains on target to improve CO2 emissions. Ships graded a “D” or “E” are required to improve. As currently drafted, operators of a vessel with a “D” rating are required to take action to regain a rating of “C” or better within a three-year time window. The remediation period for an “E” rated vessel is set at one year. If ratings are not restored to a “C” or better during the remediation period, there is the possibility of enforcement up to and including retirement of the vessel. OSG is actively seeking means to implement measures to reduce CO2 emissions and to remain compliant with the CII requirements as currently drafted. The methodology for measurement of CII and the introduction of correction factors to compensate for certain types of vessel operations are subject to review and potential modification during the three-year period commencing January 1, 2023. OSG’s ATBs are not covered under the CII regulations as currently conceived.
 
OSG believes that its vessels are compliant with the current requirements of Annex VI and the EPA. Additionally, OSG believes for its vessels that operate in the EU and the UK, they are compliant with the applicable regional mandates. Future passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO, EU, UK, United States or other countries where OSG operates that restrict emissions of GHGs could require significant additional capital or operating expenditures and could have operational impacts on OSG’s business. Although OSG cannot predict such expenditures and impacts with certainty at this time, they may be material to OSG’s results of operations.
 
Ballast Water Pollution Regulations
 
OSG’s vessels are subject to international, national and local ballast water management regulations that seek to address concerns for the release of organisms and pathogens that have been identified as being potentially harmful as a result of the carrying of ships’ ballast water from one place to another. At the international level, the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments (“BWM Convention”) defines a discharge standard consisting of maximum allowable levels of critical invasive species designed to protect the marine environment from the introduction of non-native (alien) species. OSG is meeting this standard by installing treatment systems that render the invasive species non-viable and, where required, having on board a valid International Ballast Water Management Certificate, a Ballast Water Management Plan and a Ballast Water Record Book.
 
The United States is not a signatory to the BWM Convention, and is not expected to be in the future, since it currently regulates ballast water management under two federal, partially overlapping regulatory schemes. One is administered by the USCG under the National Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990, as amended by the National Invasive Species Act of 1996, and the other is administered by the EPA under the U.S. Clean Water Act (“CWA”). Several U.S. states also have their own supplemental requirements. The American Bureau of Shipping has been authorized to issue a Statement of Voluntary Compliance (“SOVC”) to any U.S. Flag vessel that has an approved Ballast Water Management Plan that contains the information required by the BWM Convention.

The discharge of ballast water is subject to CWA permitting requirements (Vessel General Permit or “VGP”) in accordance with the EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”). The VGP establishes ballast water discharge limits that generally align with the performance standards implemented under the USCG’s rules and the IMO Convention. It also sets more stringent effluent limits for oil to sea interfaces and exhaust gas scrubber wastewater.
 
The “Vessel Incidental Discharge Act” (“VIDA”) restructures the way EPA and the USCG are to regulate incidental discharges in the future, and is expected to phase out provisions of the VGP and existing USCG regulations replacing them with EPA-developed standards and USCG regulations. The EPA recently announced that it intends to provide clarification on the proposed rule later in 2023. Depending on the contents of the final rule, new VIDA requirements could require additional capital or operating expenditures and could have operational impacts on OSG’s business. 
 
OSG complies with these regulations and anticipates that compliance with the various conventions, laws and regulations relating to ballast water management that may be adopted in the future will require substantial additional capital or operating expenditures and could have operational impacts on OSG’s business.
 
Safety of Life at Sea
 
The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (“SOLAS”) addresses the safety of merchant ships. Amendments to the SOLAS conventions come into force yearly and flag states are responsible for ensuring that ships under their flag comply with its requirements.

Under the ISM Code, vessel operators are required to develop a safety management system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy describing how the objectives of a functional safety management system will be met. OSG has a safety management system for each of its operating subsidiaries, with instructions and procedures for the safe operation of its vessels, reporting accidents and non-conformities, internal audits and management reviews and responding to emergencies, as well as, defined levels of responsibility. The ISM Code requires OSG to have a Document of Compliance (“DoC”) for the vessels it operates and a Safety Management Certificate (“SMC”) for each vessel it operates, including an annual internal audit and an external verification audit twice in a five-year period.

OSG maintains a DoC, which was reissued for five years on September 17, 2022. ATC maintains a DoC, which was reissued for five years on July 11, 2019. OSG is also certified to the SQE requirements of the ABS Guide for Marine Health, Safety, Quality, Environmental and Energy Management, which includes meeting the requirements of the International Standards of Organization in ISO9001:2015 (Quality Management) and ISO14001:2015 (Environmental Management) for the management of operation of oil tankers, chemical tankers, and other cargo ships.
 
Security Regulations and Practices
 
The U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (the “MTSA”) requires the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. SOLAS imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities, most of which are contained in the International Ship and Port Facilities Security Code (the “ISPS Code”), which requires the development of vessel security plans and compliance with flag state security certification requirements. To trade internationally, a vessel must attain an International Ship Security Certificate (“ISSC”) from a recognized security organization approved by the vessel’s flag state. All of OSG’s vessels have developed and implemented vessel security plans that have been approved by the USCG, have obtained an ISSC and comply with applicable security requirements.
 
OSG monitors the waters in which its vessels operate for pirate activity. Company vessels that may transit high risk areas (“HRAs”) follow best management practices for reducing risk and preventing pirate attacks compliant with protocols established by the naval coalition protective forces operating in such areas.
 
The maritime community addresses the vulnerability of ship operations to cyber security threats, both at sea and while in port. Exposure to these threats has become pervasive due to the increasing reliance on information and operating technology systems used in the management of ship operations. Regulatory requirements, voluntary and best practice guidance are continuing to evolve for maritime cyber security practices. The USCG and IMO seek to ensure that cyber risks are appropriately addressed in safety management systems. Verification of safety management compliance is conducted annually.
 
Security breaches and viruses could expose OSG to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches (including the inability of our third-party vendors to prevent security breaches) could also cause existing clients to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation, cause losses to us or our clients, damage our brand and increase our costs. OSG has completed a fleetwide upgrade of its Information Technology (“IT”) systems to further protect its infrastructure against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses and has also implemented a variety of required cyber security protocols to appropriately protect its operating systems. While we continue to invest time, effort and financial resources to secure our systems, networks and communications, our security measures cannot provide absolute assurance that we will be successful in preventing or responding to all cyber security attacks. There can be no assurance that any breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results.
 
INSPECTION BY CLASSIFICATION SOCIETIES 
 
Every oceangoing vessel must be “classed” by a Classification Society. The Classification Society certifies that the vessel is “in class,” signifying that the vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the Classification Society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the vessel’s country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member. In addition, where surveys are required by international conventions and corresponding laws and ordinances of a flag state, the Classification Society will undertake them on application or by official order, acting on behalf of the authorities concerned. The Classification Society also undertakes, on request, other surveys and checks that are required by regulations and requirements of the flag state. These surveys are subject to agreements made in each individual case and/or to the regulations of the country concerned.
 
Regular and extraordinary surveys of hull, machinery, including the electrical plant, and any special equipment classed are required to be performed for a vessel to maintain its class certification. For seagoing ships, annual surveys are conducted for the hull and the machinery, including the electrical plant and, where applicable, for special equipment classed, at intervals of 12 months from the date of commencement of the class period indicated in the certificate. Intermediate surveys are typically conducted two and one-half years after commissioning and upon each class renewal. Intermediate surveys may be carried out on the second or third annual survey.

---+---------------------------------


Vessels are required to dry dock for inspection of the underwater hull at each intermediate survey and at each class renewal survey. For vessels less than 15 years old, Classification Societies permit in-water inspections by divers in lieu of dry docking for intermediate surveys, subject to other requirements of such Classification Societies. Class renewal surveys, known as special surveys, are carried out for the ship’s hull, machinery, including the electrical plant, and for any special equipment classed, at the intervals indicated by the character of classification for the hull. For vessels greater than 15 years old, out of water drydocking is to take place twice in a five-year period.
 
In a special survey, the vessel is thoroughly examined, including audio-gauging to determine the thickness of the steel structures. Should the thickness be found to be below class requirements, the Classification Society would prescribe steel renewals. Substantial amounts of money may have to be spent for steel renewals to pass a special survey if the vessel experiences excessive wear and tear. In lieu of the special survey every four or five years, depending on whether a grace period was granted, a shipowner has the option of arranging with the Classification Society for the vessel’s hull or machinery to be on a continuous survey cycle, in which every part of the vessel would be surveyed within a five-year cycle. Upon a shipowner’s request, the surveys required for class renewal may be split according to an agreed schedule to extend over the entire period of class survey period. This process is referred to as continuous class renewal.
 
If defects are found during any survey, the Classification Society surveyor will issue a “finding” or a “recommendation” which must be rectified by the vessel owner within prescribed time limits.
 
Most insurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage that a vessel be certified as “in class” by a Classification Society that is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies (“IACS”). All OSG’s vessels are currently, and OSG expects will be, certified as being “in class” by the ABS, a major Classification Society.
 
INSURANCE 
 
Consistent with the prevailing practice in the industry, OSG presently carries protection and indemnity (“P&I”) insurance coverage for pollution of $1.0 billion per occurrence on every vessel in its fleet, as well as for other perils faced by vessel owners and operators in varying limits. Currently, the fleet is entered through membership in three different mutual protection and indemnity associations (“P&I Associations”), all of whom are members of the International Group of P&I clubs. The P&I Associations that comprise the International Group insure approximately 90% of the world’s commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each other’s liabilities within certain limits. Each P&I Association has capped its exposure to each of its members at approximately $7.5 billion through reinsurance arrangements. As a member of a P&I Association that is a member of the International Group, OSG is subject to calls payable to the P&I Associations based on its claim record as well as the claim records of all other members of the individual P&I Associations of which it is a member, and the members of the pool of P&I Associations comprising the International Group. Each of OSG’s vessels is insured by one of three P&I Associations. While OSG has historically been able to obtain pollution coverage at commercially reasonable rates, no definitive assurances can be given that such insurance will continue to be available in the future.
 
OSG also carries marine hull and machinery and war risks (including piracy) insurance, which includes the risk of actual or constructive total loss, for all of its owned and operated vessels except for one where the risk is borne by the vessel’s owner as noted under the contract. OSG is self-insured for hull and machinery claims in amounts in excess of the individual vessel deductibles.

TAXATION OF THE COMPANY
 
The following U.S. tax law applicable to the Company is based on the provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, existing and U.S. Treasury Department regulations, administrative rulings, pronouncements and judicial decisions, all as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. No assurance can be given that changes in or interpretation of existing laws will not occur or will not be retroactive or that anticipated future circumstances will in fact occur.
Tonnage Tax
 
OSG made an election to have the foreign operations of OSG’s U.S. Flag vessels taxed under a “tonnage tax” regime rather than the usual U.S. corporate income tax regime. As a result, OSG’s gross income for U.S. income tax purposes with respect to eligible U.S. Flag vessels does not include (1) income from qualifying shipping activities in U.S. foreign trade (i.e., transportation between the United States and foreign ports or between foreign ports), (2) income from cash, bank deposits and other temporary investments that are reasonably necessary to meet the working capital requirements of qualifying shipping activities, and (3) income from cash or other intangible assets accumulated pursuant to a plan to purchase qualifying shipping assets. OSG’s taxable income with respect to the operations of its eligible U.S. Flag vessels, of which there are two, is based on a “daily notional taxable income,” which is taxed at the highest U.S. corporate income tax rate. The daily notional taxable income from the operation of a qualifying vessel is 40 cents per 100 tons of the net tonnage of the vessel up to 25,000 net tons, and 20 cents per 100 tons of the net tonnage of the vessel in excess of 25,000 net tons. The taxable income of each qualifying vessel is the product of its daily notional taxable income and the number of days during the taxable year that the vessel operates in U.S. foreign trade. 
 
During 2022, OSG’s Marshall Islands flagged vessel, which traded in the international markets, did not qualify for the U.S. income tax exclusion described in the above paragraph. Therefore, the operations of the vessel were subject to U.S. taxation and included in the calculation of taxable income. In addition, the Marshall Islands flagged vessel was taxed under the “daily notional taxable income” under the Marshall Islands tonnage tax regime. The daily notional taxable income from the operation of the vessel were $500 for 2,500 net tonnage or less, 20 cents per net tonnage between 2,501 to 5,000 net tonnage, 17 cents per net tonnage between 5,001 to 25,000 net tonnage, 15 cents per net tonnage between 25,001 to 50,000 net tonnage and 12.5 cents per net tonnage over 50,000 net tonnage. The tonnage tax of the vessel was the product of its daily notional taxable income and the percentage of days during the taxable year the vessel operated in U.S. foreign trade.
