Business Organization
During the second quarter of 2018, we modified our internal reporting structure to better align the way financial information is reported to and analyzed by executive leadership in part as a result of recent acquisitions contributing to the growth within the newly-aligned Services and Software segment. Previously, we had two reporting segments: Products and Services. The changes in reporting structure consist of Systems Integration-related revenue and costs moving from the old Services segment into the newly-presented Products and Systems Integration segment and software-related revenue and costs moving from the old Products segment into the newly-presented Services and Software segment.
Products and Systems Integration Segment 
 The Products and Systems Integration segment offers an extensive portfolio of infrastructure, devices, accessories, video solutions, and the implementation, optimization, and integration of such systems, devices, and applications. The primary customers of the Products and Systems Integration segment are government, public safety and first-responder agencies, municipalities, and commercial and industrial customers who operate private communications networks and video solutions. In 2018, the segment’s net sales were $5.1 billion, representing 69% of our consolidated net sales. The Products and Systems Integration segment has the following two principal product lines:

Strategy and Focus Areas
In 2018, Motorola Solutions marked 90 years as a communications technology provider. Since Motorola was founded in 1928, our commitment to innovation has been at the heart of our company. Today, we design and deliver solutions that are purpose-built for the unique needs of our customers, who work in coal mines, run into burning buildings, teach in classrooms, and everything in between. We offer comprehensive solutions that include infrastructure, devices, software applications, video cameras and analytics, and services that help our customers work safely and efficiently. 
Our strategy for long-term growth and the evolution of our business includes organic and inorganic investments in the following four areas: 
(i)Continued innovation in standards-based voice and data solutions spanning APCO 25, TETRA, DMR, and Long-term Evolution ("LTE") technologies. Our dedication, focus, and innovation for public safety and commercial solutions built the foundation of our land mobile radio ("LMR") platform business, which is reflected in our install base of over 13,000 systems deployed in 100+ countries around the world. These systems have a multi-year and often multi-decade life span which helps drive demand for additional device sales, software upgrades, infrastructure refresh and expansion, as well as additional services to maintain, monitor, and manage these complex networks and solutions. We believe our government and commercial customers will continue to require next-generation systems, enhanced software features and analytics, as well as incremental services to drive operational efficiencies. 
(ii)Services offerings that leverage our large global install base and allow our customers to improve performance across their systems, devices, and applications for greater safety and productivity. Our comprehensive suite of services - from repair, technical support, security, and system monitoring to operation of customer-owned networks or Motorola Solutions-owned networks, ensures continuity and reduces risks for continued critical communications operations. Today, agency procurement models are primarily capital expenditure investments in customer-owned and operated solutions with long-term contracts. As agencies seek budget predictability, increased flexibility, and outcome-based solutions, there continues to be a shift to alternative consumption models. We feel our suite of services positions us well for this change and allows us to provide incremental, value-added services for our customers.

(iii) Command center software solutions to support public safety workflow - from a citizen's emergency call and dispatching first responders to communicating with personnel in the field and managing records and evidence. Today, the public safety workflow is addressed by a variety of point solutions. Motorola Solutions is building a command center software offering that provides a unified suite of solutions across the public safety workflow. As the public safety market continues to embrace software offerings to enhance their workflows, we are able to sell cloud-first software as a service ("SaaS") offering in addition to on-premise solutions with ancillary implementation and managed services.
(iv)Video analytics, network video management software and hardware, video cameras, and access control solutions for government and commercial customers. We have video solutions installed at thousands of customer sites, including school campuses, transportation systems, healthcare centers, public venues, critical infrastructure, prisons, factories, casinos, airports, financial institutions, government facilities, and retailers.
Our Customers and Contracts
We serve government agencies, state and local public safety and first-responder agencies, as well as commercial and industrial customers who utilize private communications networks, often to manage a mobile workforce. Our customer base is fragmented and widespread when considering the many levels of governmental and first-responder decision-makers that procure and use our products and services. Serving this global customer base spanning federal, state, county, province, territory, municipal, and departmental independent bodies, along with our commercial and industrial customers, requires a significant go-to-market investment.
Our sales model includes both direct sales by our in-house sales force, which tend to focus on our largest accounts, and sales through our channel partner program. Our trained channel partners include independent dealers, distributors, and software vendors around the world. The dealers and distributors each have their own sales organizations that complement and extend the reach of our sales force. The independent software vendors offer customized applications that meet specific needs in the verticals we serve.
Our largest customers are the United States ("U.S.") federal government (through multiple contracts with its various branches and agencies, including the armed services) and the Home Office of the United Kingdom, representing approximately 8% and 7% of our consolidated net sales in 2018, respectively. The loss of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings over several quarters as many of our contracts with these governments are long-term in nature. All contracts with the U.S. federal government, and certain other government agencies within the U.S., are subject to cancellation at the customer’s convenience. For a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Net sales in the Americas region continued to comprise a significant portion of our business, accounting for 69%, 68% and 68% of our consolidated net sales in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Payment terms with our customers vary worldwide. Generally, contractual payment terms range from 30 to 45 days from the invoice date within North America and typically do not exceed 90 days from the invoice date in regions outside of North America. A portion of our contracts include implementation milestones, such as delivery, installation, and system acceptance, which generally take 30 to 180 days to complete. Invoicing the customer is dependent on completion of the milestones. We generally do not grant extended payment terms. As required for competitive reasons, we may provide long-term financing in connection with equipment purchases. Financing may cover all or a portion of the purchase price.
Generally, our contracts do not include a right of return, other than for standard warranty provisions. Due to customer purchasing patterns and the cyclical nature of the markets we serve, our sales tend to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year, with the fourth quarter being the highest.
Competition
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Key competitive factors include: performance, features, quality, availability, warranty, price, vendor financing, availability of service, company reputation and financial strength, partner community, and relationships with customers. Our strong reputation with customers and partners, trusted brand, technology leadership, breadth of portfolio, product performance, and specialized support services position us well for success.
We experience widespread competition from a growing number of existing and new competitors, including large system integrators and manufacturers of private and public wireless network equipment and devices. Traditional LMR competitors include: Harris, Hytera, Airbus, and Kenwood.
As demand for fully-integrated voice, data, and broadband systems continue to grow, we may face additional competition from public telecommunications carriers and telecommunications equipment providers. As we continue to evolve our services strategy, we may work with other companies on a consortium or joint venture basis as customers' delivery needs become more complex to fulfill. 
Our continued focus on growing our command center software suite and video solutions has added additional competitors such as: West Corporation, Intergraph, Central Square, Axis, Hikvision, Dahua, and Zetron.
Several other competitive factors may have an impact on our future business including: evolving spectrum mandates by government regulators and increasing investment by broadband and IP solution providers.

Other Information
Backlog
Our backlog includes all product and service orders that have been received and are believed to be firm. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our backlog was as follows:

 | December 31
(In millions) | 2018 | | 2017
Products and Systems Integration | $ | 3,199 | | | $ | 3,314
Services and Software | 7,401 | | | 6,298 | 
 | $ | 10,600 | | | $ | 9,612

Approximately 52% of the Products and Systems Integration segment backlog and 21% of the Services and Software segment backlog is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2019. The forward-looking estimate of the firmness of such orders is subject to future events that may cause the amount recognized to change.
Research and Development
We continue to prioritize investments in R&D to expand and improve our portfolio of products through both new product introductions and continuous enhancements to our core products. Our R&D programs are focused on the development of: (i) new public safety devices, infrastructure, software and solutions, (ii) command center software applications that include voice, data, and video, (iii) public safety broadband solutions based on LTE technology, and (iv) video devices and software applications.
R&D expenditures were $637 million in 2018, $568 million in 2017, and $553 million in 2016. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 5,000 employees engaged in R&D activities. In addition, we engage in R&D activities with joint development and manufacturing partners and outsource certain activities to engineering firms to further supplement our internal spend. 
Intellectual Property Matters
Patent protection is an important aspect of our operations. We have a portfolio of U.S. and foreign utility and design patents relating to our products, systems, and technologies, including research developments in radio frequency technology and circuits, wireless network technologies, over-the-air protocols, mission-critical communications, software and services, next-generation public safety, and video solutions. We have filed new patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and foreign patent offices.
We license some of our patents to third-parties, but licensing revenue is not a significant source of revenue. We are also licensed to use certain patents owned by others. Royalty and licensing fees vary from year-to-year and are subject to the terms of the agreements and sales volumes of the products subject to the license. Motorola Solutions has a royalty-free license under all of the patents and patent applications assigned to Motorola Mobility at the time of the separation of the two businesses in 2011. 
We actively participate in the development of standards for interoperable, mission-critical digital two-way radio systems. Our patents are used in standards in which our products and services are based. We offer standards-based licenses to those patents on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms.
We believe that our patent portfolio will continue to provide us with a competitive advantage in our core product areas as well as provide leverage in the development of future technologies. While we are not dependent upon a single patent or even a few patents, we do have patents that protect features and functionality of our products and services. While these patents are important, our success also depends upon our extensive know-how, innovative culture, technical leadership, and distribution channels. We do not rely solely on patents or other intellectual property rights to protect or establish our market position; however, we will enforce our intellectual property rights in certain technologies when it is necessary to protect our innovation, or in some cases where attempts to negotiate mutually agreeable licenses are not successful.
We seek to obtain patents and trademarks to protect our proprietary positions whenever possible and wherever practical. As of December 31, 2018, we owned approximately 5,320 granted patents in the U.S. and in foreign countries. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,630 U.S. and foreign patent applications pending. Foreign patents and patent applications are mostly counterparts of our U.S. patents. During 2018, we were granted approximately 550 patents in the U.S. and in foreign countries. 
We no longer own certain logos and other trademarks, trade names and service marks, including MOTOROLA, MOTO, MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS and the Stylized M logo and all derivatives thereof (“Motorola Marks”) and we license the Motorola Marks from Motorola Mobility, which is currently owned by Lenovo.

Inventory and Raw Materials
Our practice is to carry reasonable amounts of inventory to meet customers’ delivery requirements. We provide custom products that require the stocking of inventories and a large variety of piece parts and replacement parts in order to meet delivery and warranty requirements. To the extent suppliers’ product life cycles are shorter than ours; stocking of lifetime buy inventories is required to meet long-term warranty and contractual requirements. In addition, replacement parts are stocked for delivery on customer demand within a short delivery cycle.
Availability of required materials and components is generally dependable; however, fluctuations in supply and market demand could cause selective shortages and affect our results of operations. We currently procure certain materials and components from single-source vendors. A material disruption from a single-source vendor may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. If certain single-source suppliers were to become capacity constrained or insolvent, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies, or an increase in the price of supplies, and adversely impact our financial results.
Natural gas, electricity and, to a lesser extent, oil are the primary sources of energy for our manufacturing operations. Each of these resources is currently in adequate supply for our operations. The cost to operate our facilities and freight costs are dependent on world oil prices and external third-party logistics rates for inbound and outbound air lanes. Labor is generally available in reasonable proximity to our manufacturing facilities and the manufacturing facilities of our largest outsourced manufacturing suppliers. Difficulties in obtaining any of the aforementioned resources, or a significant cost increase, could affect our financial results.
Environmental Quality 
Some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal, state, local, and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air, and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites, as well as relating to the protection of the environment. Certain products of ours are subject to various federal, state, local, and international laws governing chemical substances in electronic products. During 2018, compliance with these U.S. federal, state and local, and international laws did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, or competitive position; however, we recorded a $57 million charge once we became aware of additional remediation requirements for the designated Superfund site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as the “Superfund Act”) incurred by a legacy business. The charge was primarily due to: (i) changes in the expected timeline of the remediation activities to 30 years and (ii) additional costs for further remediation efforts, increasing the reserve to $107 million.
Regulatory Matters
Radio spectrum is required to provide wireless voice, data, and video communications service. The allocation of spectrum is regulated in the U.S. and other countries and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless services and specifically to public safety users. In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (“NTIA”) regulate spectrum use by non-federal entities and federal entities, respectively. Similarly, every country around the world has one or more regulatory bodies that define and implement the rules for use of radio spectrum, pursuant to their respective national laws and international coordination under the International Telecommunications Union (“ITU”). 
We manufacture and market products in spectrum bands already allocated by regulatory bodies. These include voice and data infrastructure, mobile radios, and portable or hand-held devices. Consequently, our results could be positively or negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted by the FCC, NTIA, ITU, or regulatory agencies in other countries. Our products operate both on licensed and unlicensed spectrum. The availability of additional radio spectrum may provide new business opportunities. Conversely, the loss of available radio spectrum may result in the loss of business opportunities. Regulatory changes in current spectrum bands (e.g., the sharing of previously dedicated or other spectrum) may also provide opportunities or may require modifications to some of our products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed.
As television transmission and reception technology transitions from analog to more efficient digital modes, various countries around the world are examining, and in some cases already pursuing, the redevelopment of portions of the television spectrum. In the U.S., spectrum historically used for broadcast television, known as the 700MHz band, has been redeveloped and deployed for new uses (the so-called “digital dividend” spectrum), including broadband and narrowband wireless communications. In 2016, this trend continued in the U.S. and additional TV spectrum in the 600MHz band was auctioned for broadband communications (part of the “Broadcast Incentive Auction”). This auction closed in April 2017, but auction winners will not get access to the spectrum for several years.
Internationally, the ITU World Radio Conference ("WRC") is held every three to four years to discuss and promote global agreement on the use and cooperation of spectrum usage. The most recent WRC-15 was held in November 2015. During this conference, leaders from United Nations member countries considered a number of initiatives, including whether to allocate additional spectrum for commercial broadband use as well as whether to allocate spectrum dedicated for public safety broadband. The WRC agreed to support countries making individual decisions to allocate spectrum for public safety broadband in the 700MHz and 800MHz spectrum bands. Based on the results of WRC-15, ITU has published recommendations on how much spectrum and to which parts of the spectrum range the spectrum should be allocated for public safety broadband (taking into account regional and global harmonization to the extent practicable). The next WRC is scheduled to be held in October-November 2019. WRC-19 will focus on 5G, harmonizing the internet of things ("IOT"), and satellite coordination. Motorola Solutions continues to work with its customers and governments around the world to advocate for future allocations of dedicated

broadband spectrum for public safety which will provide new business opportunities for us in the future and to reinforce the importance of LMR spectrum and services. 
Several major markets including: Canada, the U.S., the UAE, Mexico, Singapore, and South Korea have already set aside broadband spectrum for use by public safety and the wider first-responder communities. We believe this trend will continue over time and the planned implementation of broadband public safety networks provides new opportunities for our broadband portfolio and services growth strategy. In addition, certain countries, in response to increasing security concerns, already have spectrum landscapes that permit country administrations to allocate public safety spectrum quickly without a protracted process or agreement. Some other markets including Australia and the UK are launching broadband public safety networks drawing on basic LTE infrastructure built by the carriers. These trends also provide opportunities for our broadband and services portfolio.
Employees    
At December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017 we had approximately 16,000 and 15,000 employees, respectively.
