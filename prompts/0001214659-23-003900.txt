 Item 1.         Business
 
Overview 
 
Atlis is a technology company developing next-generation battery solutions to electrify commercial vehicles and equipment for Work and to provide the electric vehicle (“EV”) infrastructure needed to facilitate adoption to EV’s. We define “Work” as industries that contribute to the building, digging, growing, maintaining, moving, hauling, and towing of the goods and services that keep our communities moving forward. We believe that widespread adoption of EVs for Work requires high performing battery and pack solutions that can effectively compete with legacy diesel-based products. Atlis designs, engineers, and plans to build proprietary AMV battery cells and packs, 1 megawatt (“MW”) plus charging stations, energy storage solutions to support infrastructure and a suite of software and services designed to allow an easy transition from diesel to electric for our target segment.
 
Our battery technology is expected to offer considerable advantages in battery capacity, charging rate, safety, and lifespan while keeping costs low. We are confident that these advantages will be highly beneficial to Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) in the automotive and medium to heavy duty equipment segments as it would encourage customers to transition to electrification in a greater extent. Our technology can solve significant issues such as fast charging in just 15 minutes, thereby allowing for a much more competitive EV experience that would match fossil fuel vehicles, something that current EVs with conventional batteries are unable to achieve. We believe Atlis technology may be used to power medium and super-duty pick-up trucks, last mile delivery vehicles, garbage trucks, cement trucks, vans, RVs, box trucks, light to heavy-duty equipment and more. In addition, our batteries could be used for commercial and residential energy storage devices.
 
AMV is an early-stage company and has not yet scaled production of its products or delivered any products to customers. Of the products we intend to bring to market, our proprietary battery technology is the furthest along in development and closest to mass production. We intend to deliver battery cells and packs to customers in 2023. Additionally, we will continue to develop our XP Platform and the XT Truck, both of which we believe will provide incremental value to our target market in the long run.
 
Our Target Market
 
Customers across the Work segments are progressively contemplating EVs for a range of reasons such as improved performance, expansion of the EV charging infrastructure, significantly reduced environmental impact, and lower costs for maintenance and operation. However, the players in these market segment faces unique barriers to the adoption of EVs due to their different usage patterns and operational requirements. In addition, the use of conventional lithium-ion (“Li-ion”) batteries in heavy-duty vehicles and equipment poses several inherent challenges that limit their adoption. Some of the main barriers to adoption include:

· | Limited energy density: Conventional batteries have a relatively low energy density, which means that heavy-duty vehicles and equipment require a large number of batteries to achieve sufficient range. This can add significant weight to the vehicle and reduce payload capacity. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Temperature sensitivity: Conventional Li-ion batteries are sensitive to temperature changes, particularly at extreme temperatures. This can impact the performance and lifespan of the battery, particularly in hot or cold environments. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Charging time: Charging time for Li-ion batteries can be significant, particularly for larger batteries. This can impact the operational efficiency of heavy-duty vehicles and equipment, which may require frequent charging throughout the day. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | High upfront costs: Electric commercial vehicles can have a higher upfront cost than their conventional counterparts, which can be a significant barrier for companies that operate on tight profit margins. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Limited range and charging infrastructure: Commercial vehicles often need to travel longer distances than passenger cars and require more frequent stops for refueling. The limited range of electric commercial vehicles and the lack of charging infrastructure can make it difficult for fleets to operate efficiently. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Payload capacity: Electric commercial vehicles often have lower payload capacity than their conventional counterparts due to the weight of the battery, which can limit their utility for certain applications. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Vehicle downtime: Commercial vehicles and equipment are often in use for long hours and may have limited downtime for charging, which can be a challenge for EVs that require longer charging times than refueling with gasoline or diesel. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Uncertainty about total cost of ownership: Companies may be hesitant to invest in electric commercial vehicles due to uncertainty about the total cost of ownership, including maintenance, repair, and replacement costs. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that effective adoption to electrification by the Work industry requires a unified solution that addresses all concerns simultaneously. A piecemeal solution where multiple companies independently develop and build pieces of the electrification puzzle while leaving the customer to figure out the rest may not adequately address all needs and may even drive greater execution risk for the customer. Atlis plans to develop a unified solution.

Principal Products and Services 
 
Atis plans to address the needs highlighted above by developing a unified set of products and solutions to support a seamless transition to electrification by the Work industry. Our products start with the AMV battery cells that are intended to go into our high-performing battery packs, which in turn, can be used by OEMs to power their electrified vehicles and equipment. Simultaneously, we plan to build megawatt charging stations that will enable 15-minute charge time for our batteries. Finally, we plan to build energy storage systems (“ESS”) that will use our battery packs to augment rising energy demand across residential, commercial and infrastructure customers. Eventually, we plan to introduce a modular and scalable electric powered platform and an electric pickup truck purposely built to leverage our battery technology to deliver high performing, all-electric vehicles for the Work market.
Our Products
 

· | AMV Energy Cell – Our proprietary battery technology is the foundation of the Atlis ecosystem. The AMV Energy Cell is designed to leverage an in-house developed NMC-811 chemistry, combined with a unique, proprietary mechanical construction, to significantly improve thermal management and reduce electrical resistance. In addition, our battery cell structure eliminates excess volume and space, thereby providing high energy density. The AMV Energy Cell, when implemented utilizing our AMV proprietary battery pack technology and AMV advanced charging station (the “AMV AAC”) - currently under development - will be capable of delivering consistent power from 0% to 100% battery pack usable capacity, while charging from 0% to 100% usable capacity in 15 minutes. This is the same amount of time it normally takes to fill an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicle with fuel. We are in small-batch, pilot production of our battery cells and expect to make customer deliveries in late 2023.

· | AMV Energy 30 pack –Called the “30 pack,” the AMV pack is a 30 Kilowatt hours (“KWh”) commodity battery pack focused on serving customers within mobility, equipment, and energy storage and infrastructure applications. The 30 pack will utilize our proprietary battery cell, pack design, electronics, and software systems, all of which are currently in development. Legacy manufacturers of vehicle battery packs typically utilize lithium-ion battery cells in either cylindrical or pouch form factor which are inherently inefficient due to high thermal and electrical resistance. Our AMV Energy 30 pack’s competitive advantage is our direct cell integration approach which minimizes thermal resistance while maximizing electrical conductivity. Our AMV Energy Cell is intended to directly integrate into our AMV Energy 30 pack product. In addition, Atlis is developing the battery pack system with a completely integrated power management, thermal management, and battery management system.

Company History
 
Since its incorporation in 2016, Atlis has been primarily focused on research and development. The business strategy, intellectual property, and initial truck design were created by the founding team. In March 2018 Atlis launched its first Regulation CF campaign to fund further development of the battery technology and the concept designs of the XP Platform and XT pickup truck. In October 2018 Atlis completed a proof-of-concept prototype battery pack that demonstrated a full charge in less than 15 minutes. In 2019 Atlis completed a proof-of-concept prototype of the XP Platform. A second Regulation CF campaign in December 2019 allowed the company to move out of Mark Hanchett’s garage and into our first production facility and hire additional engineers to finalize design of the AMV Battery cell, XT pickup truck, and XP Platform. In August 2020, Atlis launched a successful Regulation A+ campaign which funded facility expansion and continued growth of Atlis technical development teams. In September 2021, Atlis launched a Regulation CF campaign to continue scaling AMV Energy Cell development. In early 2022, Atlis launched its final Regulation A+ campaign which not only funded the company’s operations throughout the year but also provided a foundation upon which Atlis could become a public company. On September 27, 2022, Atlis became a publicly listed company under the ticker “AMV” at The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”). Atlis is an execution focused company and plans to continue to raise capital needed to execute on its immediate and long-term goals.
How We Plan to Generate Revenue 
 
We intend to pursue opportunities as an EV battery technology manufacturer, an energy storage systems company, a vehicle technology company, and a supplier for other automotive OEMs. We also intend to leverage our battery technology solutions to support other emerging electric applications such as heavy machinery, agriculture, aircraft, including electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (“eVTOL”), and marine transportation.
 
To date, Atlis has not yet generated any revenue. The Company plans to generate revenue through the sale of our products which include our AMV Battery Pack and Cube Cell, the AAC, the XP platform, the XT pickup truck and a suite of services and software to complete the ecosystem.
 
We plan to take a risk mitigated approach in going to market. We realize that building up a technology firm like ours from the ground up is a time intensive, resource intensive and capital-intensive process. A crawl, walk, run and leap approach to implementing our eco-system of products and solutions, enables the Atlis team to mitigate execution risk and it mitigates investment risk for our investors and supporters.
 
We plan to deploy our Crawl phase in 2023 by launching the AMV cells and battery packs into the market, followed closely by the 1.5MW charging stations. The development and launch of the battery cell and its integration into a battery pack, both slated for manufacturing ramp in 2023, are the foundational pieces. Then we intend to continue scaling the production and deployment of these products.
 
The AMV XP Platform and XT Pickup truck products are in research and development stage. The Company has produced a working prototype of the XP Platform and the XT pickup truck. We expect to finalize development of the production model and begin producing trucks for delivery in the coming years. In the walk phase, we expect to introduce the AMV AP platform followed by the launch of our flagship XT truck shortly after at which time we will be in the run phase. The leap phase is designed to complete the ecosystem and provide a unified set of products and services geared towards driving accelerated transition to electrification for our intended market segment.
 
Ultimately, we believe that this path allows us to focus on driving execution and building incremental value as we grow.
 
Industry 
 
Electric Vehicle Battery, Energy Storage and Charging Infrastructure
 

· | The electric vehicle battery industry is rapidly growing as OEMs target transition to completely electric product offerings, some as soon as 2025. Electric vehicle batteries are in high demand, and smaller companies are not able to secure battery supply for their production targets from the larger battery manufacturers. According to Wood Mackenzie, by 2030 the 2.3 Terawatt hour (“TWh”) global need for electric vehicle batteries is 77% higher than the forecasted supply of 1.3 Gigawatt hour (“GWh”). Furthermore, as EV’s become increasingly popular, there has been a growth in charging infrastructure around the world. According to Acumen Research and Consulting, the electric vehicle charging market is projected to hit $182 billion by 2030. However, there are still challenges to widespread adoption of EV’s. These primarily include long charge times and limited charging infrastructure. Atlis intends to supply battery cells, packs, and charging infrastructure to help fill these gaps in supply.

Energy Storage
 
Energy storage systems (ESS) have a wide range of emerging use cases that are becoming increasingly important as the adoption of renewable energy sources and electrification continues to grow. Some of the emerging use cases for energy storage systems include:

· | Grid Stabilization - Energy storage systems can help stabilize the electrical grid by storing excess energy during periods of low demand and releasing it during periods of high demand. This can help prevent blackouts and improve the reliability of the electrical grid. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Renewable Integration - Energy storage systems can help integrate renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, into the grid by storing excess energy and releasing it when demand is high. This can help balance the variability of renewable energy sources and increase the penetration of renewable energy into the grid. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Electric Vehicle Charging - Energy storage systems can be used to store energy for electric vehicle charging. This can help reduce the strain on the electrical grid during peak charging periods and enable more efficient use of renewable energy sources. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Microgrids - Energy storage systems can be used in microgrids, which are small-scale power grids that can operate independently of the main electrical grid. Microgrids can be used to provide power to remote or off-grid locations, improve the reliability of the electrical grid, and enable more efficient use of renewable energy sources. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Emergency Backup Power - Energy storage systems can be used as backup power sources during power outages or other emergencies. This can help ensure critical facilities, such as hospitals, data centers, and emergency response centers, have continuous power. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Overall, the emerging use cases for energy storage systems are diverse and are becoming increasingly important as the world shifts toward a more sustainable energy system. Atlis intends to leverage its battery technology to support the growth of the ESS market given that ESS requirements are technologically adjacent to electric vehicle batteries.
 
Pickup Trucks 
 
Pickup trucks have been the top three best-selling vehicles in the United States for the past five years. Altogether, including the new and used truck market, vehicle up-fitter market, and charging opportunity, the total market opportunity for manufacturers in the pickup truck space is north of $241 billion. Atlis intends to capture the largest market share of the electric work truck market. Our proprietary battery technology is being designed to allow us to deliver unprecedented range and charge times.
Our Company
 
Geographic Sales Territory 
 
Ultimately, Atlis is developing a technology platform that is intended to add value across the globe, and our long-term vision includes s global footprint. Although our initial focus is to manufacture and sell our products in the United States, we believe a strong interest from international markets allows us quick expansion paths in the future. The Company has signed an agreement with an Australian company Australian Manufactured Vehicles for XT pickup trucks. We have registered interest in battery packs for vehicles and energy storage solutions in the United Kingdom, France and New Zealand as well as interest in our XP platform and XT pickup trucks from South American distributors.
Distribution Channels
 
Our hardware and services will be facilitated online via our Company's website and through our internally developed business to business sales process. Our intent is to allow fleet and consumer customers to purchase AMV products both online and directly through the Company’s sales process.
Supply Chain
 
As we begin our production ramp, we have been keeping close contact with our supply chain partners to ensure we can satisfy our production goals. We have shared our 3-year production forecast, based on our current non-binding reservation and LOI engagements, with our raw material suppliers to confirm their capability to support our build plan. Our ability to meet this demand is heavily dependent on our ability to raise the necessary capital. Our suppliers include large global companies geared toward supporting Li-Ion battery manufacturing with multi-site and international presence. While we believe demand for raw materials will increase over the next several years, we also believe that our suppliers have the ability to support our requested demand.

-


At the same time, we are paying close attention to the global geopolitical situation. Similar to other manufacturing companies a large portion of our supply chain is based in China. Currently, approximately 75% of our raw material is supplied directly or indirectly from China. We intend to explore risk mitigation opportunities in parallel for alternative suppliers in Europe and North America to strengthen our supplier diversity.
 
Growth Strategy
 
We plan to take a strategic approach to scale. First, we plan to bring the AMV Battery and adjacent products (ESS and Charging) to market to drive early revenue.
 
Our strategy is to focus on execution. We are completing testing and design for manufacturing the AMV battery. From there, we plan to stand up production and begin ramping battery cell and pack manufacturing. Simultaneously, we will continue the design work to deliver our production prototype of the XP Platform and intend to deliver hand-built XT pickup trucks to follow.
 
We plan to leverage our active social media presence, influencer marketing and customer word of mouth to generate additional interest in our products. Additionally, we plan to develop a dedicated sales team to pursue large customers.
 
Regulatory Approval of Principal Products or Services
 
We will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements that we plan to comply with to begin distribution of our AMV Battery, XP, and XT products. Our batteries, and the sale of electric vehicles and motor vehicles in general, are subject to regulation under international, federal, state, and local laws, including export and import control laws. Compliance with changing regulations could be time consuming, burdensome, and expensive. To the extent compliance with new and existing regulations is cost prohibitive, our business prospects, financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected. We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, solid and hazardous waste storage, treatment and disposal, and remediation of releases of hazardous materials. There are significant capital, operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental laws and regulations. Environmental laws and regulations may become more stringent in the future, which could increase costs of compliance or require us to manufacture with alternative technologies and materials. Obtaining necessary regulatory approvals is critical to Atlis successfully launching its AMV Cell, AMV Battery Pack, AMV Advanced Charging, AMV XP, and AMV XT products. See “Risk Factors We may face regulatory challenges” for more information.
 
EPA Emissions and Certificate of Conformity
 
The U.S. Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) certifying that certain of our vehicles comply with all applicable emissions and related certification requirements. A Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards. A California Executive Order issued by the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) is also required for vehicles sold in California and states that have adopted California’s stricter standards for emissions controls related to new vehicles and engines sold in such states. States that have adopted the California standards, as approved by the EPA, also recognize the CARB Executive Order for sales of vehicles. In addition to California, there are several other states that have either adopted or are in the process of adopting the stricter California standards, including New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Washington, Oregon, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and Colorado.
 
Vehicle Safety and Testing
 
Our vehicles will be subject to, and will be required to comply with, numerous regulatory requirements established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including applicable U.S. federal motor vehicle safety standards (“FMVSS”). We intend that the AMV XT pickup truck will fully comply with all applicable FMVSSs without the need for any exemptions and expect future Atlis vehicles to either fully comply or comply with limited exemptions related to new technologies. Additionally, there are regulatory changes being considered for several FMVSSs, and while we anticipate compliance, there is no assurance until final regulation changes are enacted.
 
As a manufacturer, Atlis will need to self-certify that its vehicles meet all applicable FMVSSs, as well as the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles can be imported or sold in the United States. Numerous FMVSSs will apply to Atlis’s vehicles, such as crash-worthiness requirements, crash avoidance requirements and electric vehicle requirements. We will also be required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including Theft Prevention Act requirements, consumer information labeling requirements, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls and owner’s manual requirements.
 
The Automobile Information and Disclosure Act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, this law allows inclusion of crash test ratings as determined by NHTSA if such tests are conducted.

Atlis’s vehicles that may be sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting.
 
Seasonality
 
We expect that our operating results will fluctuate in the future due to various factors including changing economic conditions.  Seasonal trends may also be impacted by externalities such as pandemics, supply chain disruptions and materials and machinery shortages.
Impact of Inflation
 
At the end of the period, inflation was the highest in the United States in over 30 years. Our ability to obtain revenue generation and ultimately cash flow can be adversely impacted by sudden increases in specific costs, such as increases in material and labor. In addition, measures used to combat inflation, such as increases in interest rates, could also have an impact on our ability to obtain adequate terms for equipment and material financing. There can be no assurance that inflation will not affect our future results or our speed to market.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, Atlis had a total of 93 full time employees. We believe that an engaged, productive workforce is critically important to creating shareholder value. To that end, we are committed to providing a safe workplace and opportunities for professional growth and advancement based on performance, qualification, demonstrated skill and achievement at a fair wage. Additionally, given the success of our businesses hinges on the proficiency and abilities of our workforce, and we are committed to recruiting, nurturing, and retaining personnel who are well-suited to the demands of our operating environment, the Company leverages its equity as a tool to attract and retain high-skilled talent and to incentivize our management team to achieve its execution goals.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (the “JOBS Act”). As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
 
We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues are $1.07 billion or more, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
 
We are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures as long as the market value of our voting and non-voting Class A common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our voting and non-voting Class A common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.

Controlled Company Exemption
 
Our Chief Executive Officer, Mark Hanchett, beneficially owns and controls a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock. As a result, we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq listing rules. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq. Our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements. Mark Hanchett also serves as the Chairman of the Board of AMV.
