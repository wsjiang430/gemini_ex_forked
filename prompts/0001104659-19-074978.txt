ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General
 
RF Industries, Ltd. (together with subsidiaries, the “Company”) is a national manufacturer and marketer of interconnect products and systems, including coaxial and specialty cables and connectors, fiber optic cables and connectors, and electrical and electronic specialty cables and components. The Company also manufactures and markets a line of ambient thermal systems for wireless telecom companies, as well as shrouds for small cell installations for the wireless industry. Through its five manufacturing and production facilities, the Company provides a wide selection of interconnect products and solutions primarily to telecommunications carriers and equipment manufacturers, wireless and network infrastructure carriers and manufacturers and to various original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in several market segments.
 
The Company operates through two reporting segments: (i) the “RF Connector and Cable Assembly” (RF Connector) segment, and (ii) the “Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly” (Custom Cabling) segment. The RF Connector and Cable Assembly segment primarily designs, manufactures, markets and distributes a broad range of connector and cable products, including coaxial connectors and cable assemblies that are integrated with coaxial connectors, used in telecommunications, information technology, OEM markets and other end markets. The Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment designs, manufactures, markets and distributes custom copper and fiber cable assemblies, complex hybrid fiber optic and power solution cables, electromechanical wiring harnesses, wiring harnesses, ambient thermal systems, and shrouds for small cell installations.
 
Recent Transactions
 
On October 31, 2018, the Company sold Comnet Telecom Supply, Inc. (“Comnet”), its New Jersey-based manufacturer and supplier of telecommunications and data products, including fiber optic cables, cabling technologies, custom patch cord assemblies, data center consoles and other data center equipment. Comnet was a wholly-owned subsidiary that operated with a different sales model and margin profile than the rest of the Company. This divestiture reflected the Company’s transformation of its operating culture and marketing strategies.
 
On March 15, 2019, the Company purchased the business and assets of C Enterprises L.P., a California based designer and manufacturer of quality connectivity solutions to telecommunications and data communications distributors.
 
On November 4, 2019, the Company purchased Schroff Technologies International, Inc. (“Schrofftech”), a Rhode Island based manufacturer and marketer of intelligent thermal control systems used by telecommunications companies across the U.S. and Canada, and shrouds for small cell integration and installation.
 
Strategy
 
The Company’s overall strategy is to provide its customers with a broad selection of products, rapid and high-quality service, and custom design capabilities, all at competitive prices. Specifically, the Company’s overall strategy is the following:
 
Provide rapid and flexible design and manufacturing services. During the past two years, the Company has been restructuring its operations to focus on providing rapid, flexible and high quality custom manufacturing services.
 
2

 

Competitive Pricing. The Company’s manufacturing and distribution arrangements have been designed to lower costs and, thereby, to enable the Company to offer prices on both the custom manufactured products and on most standard connector and cable products that are competitive with the marketplace.
 
Leverage its manufacturing and distribution capabilities and facilities. The Company’s strategy is to operate its five manufacturing and distribution locations to best provide our customers with a competitively priced, high quality customized product delivered with a fast turnaround time. As part of this strategy, the Company utilizes a “one-company” approach to its five production and distribution locations and allocates its resources based on their production specialization capabilities, proximity to the shipment destination and many other factors. Using this “one-company” approach, the Company’s goal is to not only shorten delivery times but to also lower shipping costs. The Company currently operates from its five manufacturing and distribution locations in the U.S.; two in California, and three in the Northeast.
 
Integrate marketing and selling efforts. The Company’s strategy is to integrate and cross-sell the product lines manufactured at, or distributed by its five facilities. The Company has been integrating the marketing and sales efforts of the five divisions, thereby expanding the number and type of products each division can offer to its existing client base.
 
Broad range of immediately available connector products. The Company’s strategy is to stock a very large selection of connector parts, including parts for older or discontinued products that are available for immediate delivery. As a result, the Company is able to fill smaller orders for unique connector parts, as well as provide a broad range of standard connector products.
 
Targeted focus of product lines. The Company’s revised strategy is to focus on passive products that are integrated into telecommunications, infrastructure and similar products manufactured by others, rather than manufacturing and selling operating components or products. As a result, the Company no longer manufactures radio modems, no longer provides mobile management solutions and services, and no longer manufactures medical monitoring products.
 
Increase long-term relationships with customers. The Company’s goal is to establish longer-term relationships with the customers who have to date used the Company for specialized projects by having the Company’s customized solutions built into the customer’s product specifications and bill of materials.
 
Grow through strategic and targeted acquisitions. The Company will continue to consider strategic acquisitions of companies or technologies that can increase or diversify the Company’s customer base, supplement the Company’s management team, expand the Company’s product offerings, and/or expand the Company’s footprint in a relevant market segment.
 
Operations
 
The Company currently conducts its operations through its five divisions.
 
RF Connector and Cable Assembly Segment.
 
The Company’s RF Connector and Cable Assembly segment (“RF Connector segment”) consists of the RF Connector and Cable Assembly division (“RF Connector division”) that is based at the Company’s headquarters in San Diego, California. Although most of the Company’s RF connector and cable products are inventoried and distributed from its San Diego facilities, some of these products also are inventoried and distributed from the Company’s other facilities. The RF Connector division is engaged in the design, manufacture and distribution of coaxial connector solutions for companies that design, build, operate, maintain and use wireless voice, data, messaging, and location tracking systems. Coaxial connector products consist primarily of connectors which, when attached to a coaxial cable, facilitate the transmission of analog and digital signals in various frequencies. Although most of the connectors are designed to fit standard products, the RF Connector division also sells custom connectors specifically designed and manufactured to suit its customers’ requirements such as the Wi-Fi and broadband wireless markets.
 
The Company’s RF Connector division typically carries over 1,500 different types of connectors, adapters, tools, and test and measurements kits. This division’s RF connectors are used in thousands of different devices, products and types of equipment. Since the RF Connector division’s standard connectors can be used in a number of different products and devices, the discontinuation of one product typically does not make the Company’s connectors obsolete. Accordingly, most connectors carried by the Company can be marketed for a number of years and are only gradually phased out. Furthermore, because the Company’s connector products are not dependent on any single line of products or any market segment, the Company’s overall sales of connectors tend to fluctuate less when there are material changes or disruption to a single product line or market segment. Sales of the Company’s connector products are, however, dependent upon the infrastructure build-out by large telecommunications firms and on the Company’s ability to market its products to these customers.
 
Cable assembly products manufactured and sold by the RF Connector division consist of various types of coaxial cables that are attached to connectors (usually the Company’s connectors) for use in a variety of communications applications. Cable assemblies manufactured for the RF Connector division are primarily manufactured at the Company’s San Diego, California facilities using state-of-the-art automation equipment and are sold through distributors or directly to major OEM accounts. Cable assemblies consist of both standard cable assemblies and assemblies that are custom manufactured for the Company’s clients. The Company offers a line of cable assemblies with over 100,000 cable product combinations.

The Company designs its connectors at its headquarters in San Diego, California. However, most of the RF connectors are manufactured for the Company by third-party foreign manufacturers located in Asia.
 
Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly Segment.
 
The Custom Cabling segment currently consists of four wholly-owned subsidiaries – three located in the Northeastern U.S and one located in Southern California. Until its sale on October 31, 2018, Comnet Telecom was part of the Custom Cabling segment. C Enterprises, Inc., which the Company acquired in March 2019, and Schrofftech, which was acquired in November 2019, are now part of the Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment. Certain of the products manufactured and sold by these East Coast are similar and can be manufactured at either of the East Coast facilities. The Company’s plan is to integrate certain of the manufacturing and marketing functions of these divisions so as to better address overlapping market opportunities and to more efficiently manufacture, market and ship products to the Company’s customers. The newly acquired Southern California custom cabling manufacturing and assembly facility provides similar products and services to their customers compared to the other East Coast facilities focusing largely on fiber optic and copper cable assemblies. The four subsidiaries that comprise the current Custom Cabling segment consist of the following:
Cables Unlimited, Inc. Cables Unlimited, Inc. ("Cables Unlimited") is a custom cable manufacturer located in Yaphank, New York, that RF Industries, Ltd. acquired in 2011. Cables Unlimited is a Corning Cable Systems CAH Connections SM Gold Program member, authorized to manufacture fiber optic products that are backed by Corning Cable Systems' extended warranty. Cables Unlimited designs, develops and manufactures custom connectivity solutions for the industrial, defense, telecommunications and wireless markets.  The products sold by Cables Unlimited include custom and standard copper and fiber optic cable assemblies, adapters and electromechanical wiring harnesses for communications, computer, LAN, automotive fiber optic and medical equipment.
Rel-Tech Electronics, Inc. RF Industries, Ltd. acquired Rel-Tech Electronics, Inc. ("Rel-Tech") in June 2015. Rel-Tech’s offices and manufacturing facilities are located in Milford, Connecticut. Founded in 1986, Rel-Tech is a designer and manufacturer of cable assemblies and wiring harnesses for blue chip industrial, oilfield, instrumentation, medical and military customers. Wire and cable assembly products include custom wire harnesses, ribbon cable, electromechanical and kitted assemblies, and networking and communications cabling.

The Company carries thousands of separate types of connectors, most of which are available in standard sizes and configurations and that are also offered by other companies. However, the Company also has some proprietary products, including the CompPro product line, its OptiFlex cables, and Schrofftech telecom shelter cooling and control system products. CompPro is a patented compression technology that offers advantages for a water-tight, ruggedized connection, providing easier installation, and improved system reliability on braided cables. CompPro is used by wireless network operators, installers and distributors in North America and other parts of the world. OptiFlex is a hybrid fiber optic and DC power cabling solution that the Company designed and manufactures, and the Schrofftech products are energy efficient cooling/temperature control and filtration systems for use in telecom shelters, outdoor enclosures and battery/power rooms.
 
Fiber Optic Products
 
The Company’s Cables Unlimited division is a Corning Cable Systems CAH Connections SM Gold Program member that is authorized to manufacture fiber optic products that are backed by Corning Cable Systems’ extended warranty. Through its Cables Unlimited division, the Company offers a broad range of interconnect products and systems that have the ability to combine radio frequency and fiber optic interconnect components, with various connectors and power cables through customized solutions for these customers. Cables Unlimited also manufactures OptiFlex, a custom designed hybrid fiber optic and DC power cabling solution manufactured for wireless service providers engaged in upgrading their cell towers. The custom hybrid cable is significantly lighter and possesses greater flexibility than cables previously used for wireless service.
 
C Enterprises is a Corning Cable Systems CAH Connections SM Gold Program member, authorized to manufacture fiber optic products that are backed by Corning Cable Systems’ extended warranty. C Enterprises designs, develops and manufactures connectivity solutions to telecommunications and data communications distributors.
 
Other Cabling Products
 
The Company also designs, manufactures and sells cable assemblies and wiring harnesses for industrial, oilfield, instrumentation, medical and military customers. Wire and cable assembly products include custom wire harnesses, ribbon cable, electromechanical and kitted assemblies, networking and communications cabling. DIN and Mini DIN connector assemblies include power cord, coaxial, Mil-spec and testing.
Telecommunications Thermal Control Systems and Shrouds
 
Since its acquisition of Schrofftech in November 2019, the Company now also manufactures and sells intelligent thermal control systems for outdoor telecommunications equipment. The thermal control systems, which can be controlled offsite using networked software at the telecommunication company’s own data center, maintain the interior temperature of telecommunications equipment. Schrofftech has also introduced shrouds for small cell deployments that reduce installation time and improve aesthetics by eliminating the exterior cabling used with current configurations.
Foreign Sales
 
Net sales to foreign customers accounted for $960,000 (or approximately 2%) of the Company’s net sales, and $662,000 (or approximately 1%) of the Company’s net sales for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The majority of the export sales during these periods were to Canada and Mexico.
 
The Company does not own, or directly operate any manufacturing operations or sales offices in foreign countries.
 
Distribution and Marketing
 
The Company currently sells its products through independent warehousing distributors and through its in-house marketing and sales team. Sales through independent distributors accounted for approximately 45% of the net sales of the Company for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019. The Company’s agreements with most of the distributors are nonexclusive and generally may be terminated by either party upon 30-60 days’ written notice. The Company directly sells certain of its products to large, national telecommunication equipment and solution providers who include the Company’s products in their own product offerings.
Manufacturing
 
The Company contracts with outside third parties for the manufacture of a significant portion of its coaxial connectors. However, virtually all of the RF cable assemblies sold by the Company during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019 were assembled at the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) approved factory in San Diego, California. The Company procures its raw cable from manufacturers with ISO approved factories in the United States, China and Taiwan. The Company primarily relies on fourteen manufacturers for its coaxial connectors, tools and other passive components and several plants for raw cable. Although the Company does not have manufacturing agreements with these manufacturers for its connectors and cable products, the Company does have long-term purchasing relationships with these manufacturers. There are certain risks associated with the Company’s dependence on third-party manufacturers for some of its products. See “Risk Factors” below. The Company has in-house design engineers who create the engineering drawings for fabrication and assembly of connectors and cable assemblies. Accordingly, the manufacturers are not primarily responsible for design work related to the manufacture of the connectors and cable assemblies.

Raw Materials
 
Connector materials are typically made of commodity metals such as copper, brass and zinc and include small applications of precious materials, including silver and gold. The RF Connector division purchases most of its connector products from contract manufacturers located in Asia and the United States. The Company believes that the raw materials used in its products are readily available and that the Company is not currently dependent on any supplier for its raw materials. The Company does not currently have any long-term purchase or supply agreements with its connector suppliers. The Custom Cabling divisions obtain coaxial connectors from the RF Connector division. The Company believes there are numerous domestic and international suppliers of other coaxial connectors that the Company may need for any of its cabling products.
 
The Cables Unlimited, Rel-Tech Electronics, C Enterprises, and Schrofftech divisions purchase largely all of the raw materials used in their products from sources located in the United States. Fiber optic cables are available from various manufacturers located throughout the United States; however, Cables Unlimited purchases most of its fiber optic cables from Corning Cables Systems LLC. The Company believes that the raw materials used by Cables Unlimited in its products are readily available and that Cables Unlimited is not currently dependent on any supplier for its raw materials except where Corning Extended Warranty certification is required. Neither Cables Unlimited nor Rel-Tech Electronics currently have any long-term purchase or supply agreements with their connector and cable suppliers.
 
Employees
 
As of October 31, 2019, the Company employed 281 full-time employees, of whom 51 were in accounting, administration, sales and management, 224 were in manufacturing, distribution and assembly, and 6 were engineers engaged in design, engineering and research and development. The employees were based at the Company’s facilities in San Diego, California (78 employees), Yaphank, New York (76 employees), Milford, Connecticut (51 employees), and Vista, California (76 employees). RF Industries purchased Schrofftech in November 2019. As of the date of this Annual Report, Schrofftech had 12 full-time employees, of whom six were in administration and the rest were in engineering and manufacturing. The Company also occasionally hires part-time employees.
 
The Company believes that it has a good relationship with its employees. The Cables Unlimited division employs five cable installers who are currently represented by a union. Other than the foregoing installers that belong to a union, none of the Company’s other employees are unionized.
 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 
The Company owns ten U.S. patents related to CompPro Product Line that it acquired in May 2015. The CompPro Product Line utilizes a patented compression technology that offers revolutionary advantages for a water-tight connection, easier installation, and improved system reliability on braided cables. The CompPro Product Line is used by wireless network operators, installers and distributors in North America and other parts of the world.
 
The Company’s Schrofftech subsidiary owns three issued patents (two are owned jointly) on its proprietary telecom shelter cooling and control system technology and its equipment room ventilation controls. Schrofftech has also filed five pending patent applications related to ventilation and control equipment and controls.
 
The trademarks the Company owns includes the “CompPro” registered trademark associated with the compression cable product line and the “OptiFlex™” as a trademark for its hybrid cable wireless tower cable solution. The Company and each of its subsidiaries also use various trademarks (and associated logos and trade names) in their operations, although none of these trademarks have been registered.

Because the RF Connectors division carries thousands of separate types of connectors and other products, most of which are available in standard sizes and configurations and are also offered by the Company’s competitors, the Company does not believe that its cables and connector business or competitive position is dependent on patent protection.
 
Under its agreements with Corning Cables Systems LLC, Cables Unlimited and C Enterprises are permitted to advertise that they are Corning Cables System CAH Connections SM Gold Program members.
 
Warranties and Terms
 
The Company warrants its products to be free from defects in material and workmanship for varying warranty periods, depending upon the product. Products are generally warranted to the dealer for one year, with the dealer responsible for any additional warranty it may make. The RF Connector products are warranted for the useful life of the connectors. Although the Company has not experienced any significant warranty claims to date, there can be no assurance that it will not be subjected to such claims in the future.
 
The Company usually sells to customers on 30-day terms pursuant to invoices and does not generally grant extended payment terms. Sales to most foreign customers are made on cash terms at time of shipment. Customers may delay, cancel, reduce, or return products after shipment subject to a restocking charge.
 
Under its agreements with Corning Cables Systems LLC, Cables Unlimited and C Enterprises are authorized to manufacture optic cable assemblies that are backed by Corning Cables Systems’ extended warranty (referred to as the “Gold Certified Warranty”).
  
Competition
 
The industries in which we operate are highly competitive, and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations, some of which have greater assets and financial resources than the Company, to local manufacturers. Competition is generally based on breadth of product offering, product innovation, price, quality, delivery, performance and customer service. In addition, rapid technological changes occurring in the communications industry could also lead to the entry of new competitors of all sizes against whom we may not be able to successfully compete.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition, and the inability to do so may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations
Government Regulations
 
The Company’s products are designed to meet all known existing or proposed governmental regulations. Management believes that the Company currently meets existing standards for approvals by government regulatory agencies for its principal products.
 
The Company’s products are Restriction on Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) compliant.

The Company Is Heavily Dependent Upon Wireless And Broadband Communications Providers.
 
Most of the Company’s revenues and profitability were generated from products that the Company sells, directly or through its distributors, to the wireless and broadband communications industries. In addition, the Company also sells connectors, cables and other products to companies that incorporate these products into their own wireless and broadband communications products. As a result, the Company’s business is heavily dependent upon the wireless and broadband markets. Demand for the Company’s products in these markets depends primarily on capital spending by operators for constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their telecommunication systems. The amount of this capital spending and, therefore, the Company’s sales and profitability, will be affected by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, consolidation within the telecommunications industry and the financial condition of operators. There can be no assurance that existing levels of capital spending will continue or that spending will not decrease. A significant decline in capital expenditures by wireless and broadband communications companies could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Company’s Recent Increases In Revenues and Profits Are Due In Large Part To Accelerated Spending Related to Upgrades of the U.S. Wireless Infrastructure and Networks, And Any Decline In This Activity or the Related Capital Expenditures Could Have A Material Negative Affect On The Company’s Operations And Financial Condition.
 
A major portion of the Company’s recent growth in both revenues and profitability is due to increased sales by the Company of products, particularly custom made products manufactured by the Company’s Custom Cabling segment, used to build out and/or upgrade the U.S. wireless infrastructure and related networks. The upgrades to the infrastructure are to both support existing 4G networks, as well as to lay the groundwork for mobile 5G networks. The Company’s products used to build out and upgrade cell tower networks include certain types of custom cabling, fiber optic cable, copper cabling, and hybrid fiber and power cables. Most of the Company’s recent sales of cell tower upgrade products were made, directly or through the Company’s distributors, to a small number of end users. The Company’s revenues and profits could abruptly and materially decrease if any of the Company’s primary end user customers slow down or decrease their purchases of the Company’s products. No assurance can be given that the Company will continue to benefit from the recent increase in wireless network improvements by U.S. wireless carriers.
The Company Depends On Third-Party Contract Manufacturers For A Majority Of Its Connector Manufacturing Needs. If They Are Unable To Manufacture A Sufficient Quantity Of High-Quality Products On A Timely And Cost-Efficient Basis, The Company’s Net Revenue And Profitability Would Be Harmed And Its Reputation May Suffer.
 
Substantially all of the Company’s RF Connector division’s connector products are manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. The Company relies on them to procure components for RF connectors and in certain cases to design, assemble and test its products on a timely and cost-efficient basis. If the Company’s contract manufacturers are unable to complete design work on a timely basis, the Company will experience delays in product development and its ability to compete may be harmed. In addition, because some of the Company’s manufacturers have manufacturing facilities in Taiwan and China, their ability to provide the Company with adequate supplies of high-quality products on a timely and cost-efficient basis is subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including political, social and economic instability and factors that could impact the shipment of supplies. If the Company’s manufacturers are unable to provide it with adequate supplies of high-quality products on a timely and cost-efficient basis, the Company’s operations would be disrupted and its net revenue and profitability would suffer. Moreover, if the Company’s third-party contract manufacturers cannot consistently produce high-quality products that are free of defects, the Company may experience a higher rate of product returns, which would also reduce its profitability and may harm the Company’s reputation and brand.
 
The Company does not currently have any long-term supply agreements with any of its contract manufacturers, and such manufacturers could stop manufacturing products for the Company at any time. Although the Company believes that it could locate alternate contract manufacturers if any of its manufacturers terminated their business, the Company’s operations could be impacted until alternate manufacturers are found.
 
The Company’s Prior Acquisitions And Potential Additional Future Acquisitions Could Increase Operating Costs And Expose The Company To Additional Risks.
 
As part of its plan to operate businesses that are profitable and that reflect the changing market, the Company from time to time sells unprofitable divisions and purchases new businesses. Such recent transactions include the disposition of its Comnet Telecom subsidiary on October 31, 2018, and the purchase of its new C Enterprises and Schrofftech subsidiaries in 2019. In addition, the Company has previously disclosed that, as part of its growth strategy, the Company intends to make additional acquisitions of businesses in the future. While the Company believes that restructuring its operations and acquiring other businesses will benefit the Company in the longer term, these dispositions and acquisitions have in the short term caused the Company to incur additional legal, accounting and administrative expenses, including the cost of integrating the various accounting systems of its new subsidiaries, upgrading its information systems, and the cost of managing various divisions in separate locations and states. The Company may in the future make additional acquisitions. Accordingly, the Company will be subject to numerous risks associated with the acquisition of additional businesses, including:

· | diversion of management’s attention;
--+-------------------------------------


· | the effect on the Company’s financial statements of the amortization of acquired intangible assets;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
8

 


· | the cost associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Company may not be able to secure capital to finance future acquisitions to the extent additional debt or equity is needed; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | assumption of unknown liabilities, or other unanticipated events or circumstances.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Any of these risks could materially harm the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any business that the Company acquires will achieve anticipated revenues or operating results.
 
The Company’s Dependence On Third-Party Manufacturers Increases The Risk That It Will Not Have An Adequate Supply Of Products Or That Its Product Costs Will Be Higher Than Expected.
 
The risks associated with the Company’s dependence upon third parties which develop and manufacture and assemble the Company’s products, include:
 

· | reduced control over delivery schedules and quality; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | risks of inadequate manufacturing yields and excessive costs; 
· | the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand; and
· | potential increases in prices due to raw material and/or labor costs. 

 
These risks may lead to increased costs or delay product delivery, which would harm the Company’s profitability and customer relationships.
 
An Impairment In The Carrying Value Of Goodwill, Trade Names And Other Long-Lived Assets Could Negatively Affect The Company’s Consolidated Results Of Operations And Net Worth. 
 
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends and market and economic conditions. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability. Goodwill reviews are prepared using estimates of fair value based on the estimated present value of future discounted cash flows. The Company could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment upon unexpected significant declines in operating results, the divestiture of a significant component of the Company’s business or other factors.
 
No assurance can be given that events or circumstances will not change regarding the carrying value of goodwill of the Cables Unlimited, Rel-Tech, C-Enterprises and Schrofftech subsidiaries or the CompPro product line. Should the Company in the future determine that the carrying value of the goodwill associated with some or all of these assets no longer is recoverable, the Company will have to record additional impairment losses. In the event that the Company has to record material impairment charges on the Cables Unlimited, Rel-Tech, C-Enterprises or Schrofftech subsidiaries or the CompPro product line, such future charges could materially reduce future earnings, which would negatively affect the Company’s stock price.
 
Changes In Technology May Reduce The Demand For Some Of The Company’s Products.
 
The wireless and telecommunications industry is rapidly changing. Changes in the product demands by telecommunications and other infrastructure companies may make certain of the Company’s current products obsolete. Accordingly, the Company must timely react to technological developments and provide new products to meet the shifting demands of its customers. The Company’s failure to successfully introduce new or enhanced products on a timely and cost-competitive basis could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.
If The Manufacturers Of The Company’s Coaxial Connectors Or Other Products Discontinue The Manufacturing Processes Needed To Meet The Company’s Demands Or Fail To Upgrade Their Technologies, The Company May Face Production Delays.
 
The Company’s coaxial connector and other product requirements typically represent a small portion of the total production of the third-party manufacturers. As a result, the Company is subject to the risk that a third-party manufacturer will cease production of some of the Company’s products or fail to continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of the Company’s products are based. Each of these events could increase the Company’s costs, harm its ability to deliver products on time, or develop new products.

While The Company Has In The Past Paid Dividends, No Assurance Can Be Given That The Company Will Declare Or Pay Cash Dividends In The Future.
 
During fiscal 2019, the Company made four dividends distributions to its stockholders (for a total of $0.08 per share). Dividends are declared and paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors subject to applicable laws, and depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, plans for future acquisitions, contractual restrictions, general business conditions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. If the Company does not pay a cash dividend, the Company’s stockholders will not realize a return on their investment in the Common Stock except to the extent of any appreciation in the value of the Common Stock. 
The Company’s Dependence Upon Independent Distributors To Sell And Market The Company’s Products Exposes The Company To The Risk That Such Distributors May Decrease Their Sales Of The Company’s Products Or Terminate Their Relationship With The Company.
 
The Company’s sales efforts are primarily affected through independent distributors. Although the Company has entered into written agreements with most of the distributors, the agreements are nonexclusive and generally may be terminated by either party upon 30-60 days’ written notice. The Company’s distributors are not within the control of the Company, are not obligated to purchase products from the Company, and may also sell other lines of products. There can be no assurance that these distributors will continue their current relationships with the Company or that they will not give higher priority to the sale of other products, which could include products of competitors. A reduction in sales efforts or discontinuance of sales of the Company’s products by its distributors would lead to reduced sales and could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and business. Selling through indirect channels such as distributors may limit the Company’s contact with its ultimate customers and the Company’s ability to assure customer satisfaction.
A Material Portion Of The Company’s Sales Is Dependent Upon A Few Principal Customers, The Loss Of Whom Could Materially Negatively Affect The Company’s Total Sales.
 
Two customers, a distributor and a wireless carrier, accounted for approximately 19% and 23% of the Company’s net sales, respectively, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019. One distributor accounted for approximately 62% of the Company’s net sales for the year ended October 31, 2018. The wireless carrier’s accounts receivable balance accounted for approximately 56% of the total net accounts receivable balance at October 31, 2019. The distributor’s accounts receivable balance accounted for approximately 48% of the total net accounts receivable balance at October 31, 2018.
 
None of these customers have entered into long-term written agreements with the Company, nor do they have any minimum purchase obligations. Accordingly, these customers could stop buying the Company’s products at any time and for any reason. Also, a significant portion of the Company’s recently increased sales have been sold indirectly to a few end users for use in upgrading and building out the wireless network infrastructure. A reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from these customers or the loss of the distributor or the primary end user customers of the Company’s wireless product could significantly reduce the Company’s future revenues and profits. The Company cannot provide assurance that its existing distributors or primary customers will continue to purchase at the current or historical levels or that the Company will be able to obtain orders from new customers.
 
Difficult Conditions In The Global Economy May Adversely Affected the Company’s Business And Results Of Operations.
 
A prolonged economic downturn, both in the U.S. and worldwide, could lead to lower sales or reduced sales growth, reduced prices, lower gross margins, and increased bad debt risks, all of which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Slowing economic activity, particularly in the telecommunication and data communication and wireless communications industries that represent the Company’s largest target market, may adversely impact the demand for the Company’s products. If the current economic condition in the U.S. deteriorates, the Company’s results could be adversely affected as demand for wireless products lessens. There could also be a number of other adverse follow-on effects on the Company’s business from a deterioration of economic conditions or from a credit crisis, including insolvency of certain key distributors, key suppliers, contract manufacturers and customers.
Changes In Income Tax And Other Regulatory Legislation.
 
The Company operates in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and attempts to structure its operations based upon existing laws and anticipated future changes in the law. However, when new legislation is enacted, or when new interpretations or applications of existing laws are made, the Company may need to implement changes in its policies or manner of operations, which changes could negatively affect the Company’s operations. The Company is, therefore, susceptible to unanticipated changes in legislation, especially relating to income and other taxes, import/export laws, hazardous materials, tariffs and other laws related to trade, accounting and business activities. Such changes in legislation may have an adverse effect on our business.
Because The Markets In Which The Company Competes Are Highly Competitive, A Failure To Effectively Compete Could Result In An Immediate And Substantial Loss Of Market Share.
 
The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive and the Company expects that competition will increase in these markets. In particular, the wireless and telecommunications markets in which most of the Company’s products are sold are intensely competitive. A failure to effectively compete in this market could result in an immediate and substantial loss of revenues and market share. Because most of the Company’s sales are derived from products that are not proprietary or that can be used to distinguish the Company from its competitors, the Company’s ability to compete successfully in these markets depends on a number of factors, including:
 
10

 


· | product quality; 
--+------------------------------------------------
· | reliability; 
· | customer support; 
· | time-to-market; 
· | price; 
· | market acceptance of competitors’ products; and
· | general economic conditions. 

 
The Company’s revenues may suffer if the Company is not able to effectively satisfy its customers in each of the foregoing ways. In addition, the Company’s competitors or customers may offer enhancements to its existing products or offer new products based on new technologies, industry standards or customer requirements that have the potential to replace or provide lower-cost or higher performance alternatives to the Company’s products. The introduction of enhancements or new products by the Company’s competitors could render its existing and future products obsolete or unmarketable.
 
Many of the Company’s competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources. In certain circumstances, the Company’s customers or potential customers have internal manufacturing capabilities with which the Company may compete.
 
If The Industries Into Which The Company Sells Its Products Experience Recession Or Other Cyclical Effects Impacting The Budgets Of Its Customers, The Company’s Operating Results Could Be Negatively Impacted.
 
The primary customers for the Company’s connector and cable products are in the wireless communications industries. Any significant downturn in the Company’s customers’ markets, in particular, or in general economic conditions which result in the cut back of budgets would likely result in a reduction in demand for the Company’s products and services and could harm the Company’s business. Historically, the communications industry has been cyclical, affected by both economic conditions and industry-specific cycles. Depressed general economic conditions and cyclical downturns in the communications industry have each had an adverse effect on sales of communications equipment, OEMs and their suppliers, including the Company. No assurance can be given that the wireless communications industry will not experience a material downturn in the near future. Any cyclical downturn in the communications industry could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Because The Company Sells Its Products To Foreign Customers, The Company Is Exposed To All Of The Risks Associated With International Sales, Including Foreign Currency Exposure.
 
Sales to customers located outside the United States, either directly or through U.S. and foreign distributors, accounted for approximately 2% and 1% of the net sales of the Company during the years ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. International revenues are subject to a number of risks, including:

· | longer accounts receivable payment cycles; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | difficulty in enforcing agreements and in collecting accounts receivable;
· | tariffs and other restrictions on foreign trade; 
· | economic and political instability; and the 
· | burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws. 

 
The Company’s foreign sales are also affected by general economic conditions in its international markets. A prolonged economic downturn in its foreign markets could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. There can be no assurance that the factors described above will not have an adverse material effect on the Company’s future international revenues and, consequently, on the financial condition, results of operations and business of the Company.
 
Since sales made to foreign customers or foreign distributors have historically been in U.S. dollars, the Company has not been exposed to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations. However, if the Company in the future is required to accept sales denominated in the currencies of the countries where sales are made, the Company will thereafter also be exposed to currency fluctuation risks.
 
The Inability To Hire or Retain Certain Key Professionals, Management And Staff Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Condition And Results Of Operations.
 
The Company’s future success depends largely upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, and on its ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate them. However, other than the employment agreement the entered into with Mr. Dawson, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, the Company currently does not have any other written employment agreements with its executive officers and managers. The market for employees in the Company’s industry is extremely competitive and the cost for new employees may exceed the cost of existing employees. The loss of key management and technical personnel, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

The Company Has Few Patent Rights In The Technology Employed In Its Products, Which May Limit the Company’s Ability To Compete.
 
Other than the patents that the Company owns related to its CompPro proprietary product line and its Schrofftech telecom shelter cooling products and control systems, the Company does not hold any other United States or foreign patents. The Company does not seek to protect its rights in the technology that it develops or that the Company’s third-party contract manufacturers develop by means of the patent laws, although it does protect some aspects of its proprietary products and technologies by means of copyright and trade secret laws. Accordingly, competitors can and do sell many of the same products as the Company, and the Company cannot prevent or restrict such competition.
Volatility of Trading Prices Of The Company’s Stock Could Result In A Loss On An Investment In The Company’s Stock.
 
The market price of the Company’s common stock has varied greatly, and the trading volume of the Company’s common stock has fluctuated greatly as well. These fluctuations often occur independently of the Company’s performance or any announcements by the Company. Factors that may result in such fluctuations include:

· | any shortfall in revenues or net income from revenues or net income expected by securities analysts, or a net loss in the Company’s quarterly or annual operations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | fluctuations in the Company’s financial results or the results of other communications-related companies, including those of the Company’s direct competitors; 
· | general conditions in the connector and communications industries; 
· | changes in the Company’s revenue growth rates or the growth rates of the Company’s competitors; 
· | sales of large blocks of the Company’s common stock; and 
· | conditions in the financial markets in general. 

 
In addition, the stock market may, from time to time, experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, which may be unrelated to the operating performance of any specific company. Accordingly, the market prices of the Company’s common stock may be expected to experience significant fluctuations in the future.
 
Failure To Maintain An Effective System Of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Or To Remediate Weaknesses Could Materially Harm The Company’s Revenues, Erode Stockholder Confidence In The Company's Ability To Pursue Business And Report Its Financial Results/Condition, And Negatively Affect The Trading Price Of The Company’s Common Stock.
 
As a public reporting company, the Company is required to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. Failure to establish such internal control, or any failure of such internal control once established, could adversely impact the Company’s public disclosures regarding its business, financial condition or results of operations. Any failure of our internal control over financial reporting could also prevent the Company from maintaining accurate accounting records and discovering accounting errors and financial frauds.
 
Rules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are complex, and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. Any assessment by management that there are weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in the internal controls over financial reporting (including those weaknesses identified in periodic reports), or disclosure of management’s assessment of the internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of the Company’s common stock.
 
As of October 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company determined that its internal control over financial reporting was effective. However, no assurance can be given that there will not be failures in our internal controls in future periods.
 
A Cyber Incident Could Result In Information Theft, Data Corruption, Operational Disruption, And/ Or Financial Loss.
 
Businesses have become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. A cyber attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption or result in denial of service on websites. The Company depends on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure, to process and record financial and operating data, and communicate with its employees and business partners. The Company’s technologies, systems, networks, and those of its business partners may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of the Company’s business operations. Although to date the Company has not experienced any losses relating to cyber attacks, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
