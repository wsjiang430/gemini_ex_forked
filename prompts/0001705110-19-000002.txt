OVERVIEW
Who We Are
ANGI Homeservices connects millions of homeowners to home service professionals through its portfolio of digital home services brands, including HomeAdvisor®, Angie's List® and Handy. Combined, these leading marketplaces have collected more than 15 million reviews over the course of 20 years, allowing homeowners to research, match and connect on-demand to the largest network of service professionals online, through our mobile apps or by voice assistants. ANGI Homeservices owns and operates brands in eight countries.
As used herein, "ANGI Homeservices," the "Company," "we," "our," "us" and similar terms refer to ANGI Homeservices Inc. and its subsidiaries (unless the context requires otherwise).
The Company has two operating segments: North America (United States and Canada) and Europe. North America primarily includes the operations of HomeAdvisor, Angie’s List, Handy, mHelpDesk and HomeStars. Europe includes Travaux, MyHammer, MyBuilder, Werkspot and Instapro.
History
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 13, 2017 as Halo TopCo, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of IAC/InterActiveCorp ("IAC"), and changed our name to ANGI Homeservices Inc. on May 4, 2017. We are a publicly traded holding company that was formed to facilitate the combination of IAC’s HomeAdvisor business and Angie’s List, Inc. (the "Combination"), which was completed on September 29, 2017. For information regarding the Combination, see "Note 4-Business Combinations" to the consolidated and combined financial statements set forth in "Item 8-Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
We acquired Handy Technologies, Inc. ("Handy"), a leading platform in the United States for connecting individuals looking for household services (primarily cleaning and handyman services) with top-quality, pre-screened independent service professionals, on October 19, 2018. Prior to its sale on December 31, 2018, we also operated Felix, a pay-per-call advertising service business, which was included in our North America segment. 
DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESSES
Marketplace
Overview
The HomeAdvisor digital marketplace service ("HomeAdvisor") connects consumers with service professionals nationwide for home repair, maintenance and improvement projects. HomeAdvisor provides consumers with tools and resources to help them find local, pre-screened and customer-rated service professionals, as well as instantly book appointments online. HomeAdvisor also connects consumers with service professionals instantly by telephone, as well as offers several home services-related resources, such as cost guides for different types of home services projects. Handy connects individuals looking for household services (primarily cleaning and handyman services) with top-quality, pre-screened independent service professionals. 
Together, we refer to the HomeAdvisor and Handy businesses in the United States as the "Marketplace." We provide all Marketplace matching services, related tools and directories to consumers free of charge.
As of December 31, 2018, the Marketplace had a network of approximately 214,000 service professionals, each of whom had an active network membership and/or paid for consumer matches (in the case of HomeAdvisor service professionals) or completed a job sourced through the Handy platform (in the case of Handy service professionals) in December 2018. Collectively, these service professionals provided services in more than 500 categories and 400 discrete markets in the United States, ranging from cleaning and installation services to simple home repairs and larger home remodeling projects. The Marketplace generated approximately 23.5 million service requests from over 13 million households during the year ended

December 31, 2018. Service requests consisted of fully completed customer service requests submitted to HomeAdvisor and completed jobs sourced through the Handy platform. 
Consumer Services
Consumers can submit a service request for a service professional directly through HomeAdvisor platforms, as well as indirectly through certain paths on some of our other branded platforms and various third-party affiliate platforms. In the case of service requests submitted through HomeAdvisor and third-party affiliate platforms, consumers are generally matched (through our proprietary algorithms) with up to four service professionals from the HomeAdvisor network of service professionals based on several factors, including the type of services desired, location and the number of service professionals available to fulfill the request. In the case of service requests submitted through our other branded platforms, consumers are generally matched (through our proprietary algorithms) with a combination of HomeAdvisor service professionals and service professionals from the relevant branded platform (as and if available for the given service request). 
Service professionals may contact consumers with whom they have been matched directly and consumers can review profiles, ratings and reviews of presented service professionals and select the service professional whom they believe best meets their specific needs. Consumers are under no obligation to work with any service professional(s) referred by or found through any of our branded or third-party affiliate platforms.
In addition to (or in lieu of) submitting service requests, consumers can also search for service professionals, as well as access service professional ratings and reviews and obtain quotes, directly through the HomeAdvisor online directory. Consumers can rate and review service professionals with whom they have been connected, as well as those listed in the HomeAdvisor online directory.
HomeAdvisor also provides several on-demand services, including Instant Booking and Instant Connect (patent-pending). Through Instant Booking, consumers can schedule appointments for select home services with a HomeAdvisor service professional instantly across certain HomeAdvisor platforms. Through Instant Connect, consumers can connect with a HomeAdvisor service professional instantly by phone, as well as through digital voice assistant platforms. In certain markets, HomeAdvisor also provides Same Day Service and Next Day Service for certain home services.
In addition to matching and on-demand services, consumers can access the online HomeAdvisor True Cost Guide, which provides project cost information for more than 400 project types nationwide, as well as a library of home services-related content, which consists primarily of articles about home improvement, repair and maintenance, tools to assist consumers with the research, planning and management of their projects and general advice for working with service professionals.
Through the Handy platform, consumers can select the service they need and specify when (date and time) they want the service to be provided; this information is then used to match consumers with Handy service professionals. In certain markets, consumers can also submit a request to book a specific Handy service professional for a given job. In both cases, the service is then scheduled and paid for directly through the Handy platform. In addition, consumers who purchase furniture, electronics, appliances and other home-related items from select third-party retail partners online (and in certain markets, in store) can simultaneously purchase assembly, installation and other related services to be fulfilled by Handy service professionals. The service is then paid for directly through the applicable third-party retail partner platform and scheduled through the Handy platform. Consumers can also search for service professionals by zip code on the Handy platform and contact them through the Handy platform. 
Service Professional Services
We primarily offer and sell HomeAdvisor memberships and related products and services to service professionals through our sales force (described below). The basic HomeAdvisor annual membership package includes membership in the HomeAdvisor network of service professionals, as well as access to consumer matches through HomeAdvisor platforms and a listing in the HomeAdvisor online directory and certain other affiliate directories. Membership also includes a business profile page on HomeAdvisor.com, a mobile application and access to various online tools designed to help service professionals more effectively market to, and manage and connect with, consumers with whom they are matched. In addition to the membership subscription fee, HomeAdvisor service professionals pay fees for consumer matches. In the case of Handy, we provide service professionals who self-register on the Handy platform with access to a pool of consumers seeking service professionals. When a service is scheduled through the Handy platform, the related payment is processed and we charge the service professional a booking fee. 
4

We also offer certain other subscription products, primarily to HomeAdvisor service professionals, through mHelpDesk, a provider of cloud-based field service software for small to mid-size businesses. Through mHelpDesk, we provide (among other products and services) mobile office management software that allows service professionals to complete several job-related tasks (such as scheduling, managing job flow, creating and distributing estimates and invoices and processing payments) real time while on the go. We also provide custom website development and hosting services.
Angie’s List
Overview
Angie’s List connects consumers with service professionals for local services through a nationwide online directory of service professionals in over 700 service categories, as well as provides consumers with valuable tools, services and content (including verified reviews of local service professionals), to help them research, shop and hire for local services. We provide consumers with access to the Angie’s List nationwide online directory and related basic tools and services free of charge.
Consumer Services
Through most Angie’s List platforms, consumers can currently register and search for a service professional in the Angie’s List nationwide online directory and/or be matched with a service professional.
Consumers who register can access ratings and reviews and search for service professionals, as well as access certain promotions. Free registration is required in order to access the directory and related basic tools and services. For a fee, we offer two premium membership packages, which include varying degrees of online and phone support, access to exclusive promotions and features and the award-winning Angie’s List print magazine. When consumers choose to be matched with a service professional, they will generally be matched (through our proprietary algorithm) with a combination of HomeAdvisor service professionals and selected certified service professionals (described below) from the Angie’s List nationwide online directory (as and if available for the given service request).
Consumers can rate service professionals listed in the Angie’s List nationwide online directory on an "A" to "F" grading scale based on a variety of criteria, including overall experience, availability, price, quality, responsiveness, punctuality and professionalism and other criteria, depending on the type of service provided. Ratings on each applicable criterion are weighted across all reviews submitted for the service professional to produce such professional’s grade on Angie’s List. Consumers can also provide a detailed description of (and commentary regarding) their service experience. Ratings and reviews cannot be submitted anonymously and there are processes in place to prevent service professionals from reporting on themselves or their competitors, as well as to detect fraudulent or otherwise problematic reviews.
Service Professional Services
Angie’s List provides service professionals with a variety of services and tools. Generally, service professionals with an overall member grade below a "B" are not eligible for certification. Service professionals must satisfy certain criteria for certification, including retaining the requisite member grade, passing certain criminal background checks and attesting to proper licensure requirements.
Once eligibility criteria are satisfied, service professionals must purchase term-based advertising from us to obtain certification. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 36,000 certified service professionals under contract for advertising. If a certified service professional fails to meet any eligibility criteria during the term of his or her contract, refuses to participate in our complaint resolution process or engages in what we determine to be prohibited behavior through any of our service channels, we suspend any existing advertising and exclusive promotions and the related advertising contract is subject to termination.
Certified service professionals rotate among the first service professionals listed in directory search results for an applicable category (together with their company name, overall rating, number of reviews, certification badge and basic profile information), with non-certified service professionals appearing below certified service professionals in directory search results. Certified service professionals can also provide exclusive promotions to members. When consumers choose to be matched with a service professional, our proprietary algorithm will determine where a given service professional appears within related results.

Our International Businesses
We also operate several international businesses that connect consumers with home service professionals. These international businesses include: (i) Travaux, MyHammer and Werkspot, the leading home services marketplaces in France, Germany and the Netherlands, respectively, (ii) MyBuilder, HomeStars and Instapro, leading home services marketplaces in the United Kingdom, Canada and Italy, respectively, and (iii) the Austrian operations of MyHammer. We own controlling interests in MyHammer, MyBuilder and HomeStars and wholly-own Travaux, Werkspot and Instapro. The business models of our international businesses vary by jurisdiction and differ in certain respects from the HomeAdvisor and Handy business models.
Revenue
Our revenue is primarily derived from: (i) consumer connection revenue, which consists of fees paid by HomeAdvisor service professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the service professional ultimately provides the requested service) and booking fees from completed jobs sourced through the Handy platform, and (ii) membership subscription fees paid by HomeAdvisor service professionals. Consumer connection revenue varies based upon several factors, including the service requested, product experience offered and geographic location of service. Revenue is also derived from: (i) sales of time-based website, mobile and call center advertising to service professionals by Angie's List and (ii) membership subscription fees from consumers.
Marketing
We market our various products and services to consumers primarily through digital marketing (primarily paid search engine marketing, display advertising and third-party affiliate agreements) and traditional offline marketing (national television and radio campaigns), as well as through e-mail. Pursuant to third-party affiliate agreements, third parties agree to advertise and promote HomeAdvisor products and services (and those of HomeAdvisor service professionals) on their platforms. In exchange for these efforts, these third parties are paid a fixed fee when visitors from their platforms click through and submit a valid service request through HomeAdvisor, or when visitors submit a valid service request on the affiliate platform and the affiliate transmits the service request to HomeAdvisor. We also market our products and services to consumers through relationships with select third-party retail partners and, to a lesser extent, through partnerships with other contextually related websites and direct mail.
We market subscription packages and related products and services to service professionals primarily through our Golden, Colorado based sales force, as well as through sales forces in Denver and Colorado Springs, Colorado, Lenexa, Kansas, New York, New York, Indianapolis, Indiana and Chicago, Illinois. We also market these products and services through paid search engine marketing, digital media advertising and direct relationships with trade associations and manufacturers. We market term-based advertising and related products to service professionals primarily through our Indianapolis based sales force.
We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in digital and traditional offline marketing (with continued expansion into new and existing digital platforms) to consumers and service professionals to promote our products and services and drive visitors to our various platforms and service professionals.
Technology
Each of our brands and businesses develops its own technology to support its products and services, leveraging both open-source and vendor supported software technology. Each of our various brands and businesses has dedicated engineering teams responsible for software development and the creation of new features to support our products and services across a full range of devices (desktop, mobile web, native mobile applications and digital voice assistant platforms). Our engineering teams use an agile development process that allows us to deploy frequent iterative releases for product and service features. 
Competition
The home services industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and in many important respects, local in nature. We compete with, among others: (i) search engines and online directories, (ii) home and/or local services-related platforms, (iii) providers of consumer ratings, reviews and referrals and (iv) various forms of traditional offline advertising (primarily local in nature), including radio, direct marketing campaigns, yellow pages, newspapers and other offline directories. We also compete with local and national retailers of home improvement products that offer or promote installation services. We believe our biggest competition comes from the traditional methods most people currently use to find service professionals, which is by word-of-mouth and through referrals.
6

We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:

• | the size, quality, diversity and stability of our network of service professionals and the breadth of our online directory listings;


• | the functionality of our websites and mobile applications and the attractiveness of their features and our products and services generally to consumers and service professionals, as well as our continued ability to introduce new products and services that resonate with consumers and service professionals generally;


• | our ability to continue to build and maintain awareness of, and trust in and loyalty to, our various brands, particularly our Angie’s List, HomeAdvisor and Handy brands;


• | our ability to consistently generate service requests and jobs through the Marketplace and leads through our online directories that convert into revenue for our service professionals in a cost-effective manner; and


• | the quality and consistency of our service professional pre-screening processes and ongoing quality control efforts, as well as the reliability, depth and timeliness of customer ratings and reviews.

Intellectual Property 
We regard our intellectual property rights as critical to our success generally, with our trademarks, service marks and domain names being especially critical to the continued development and awareness of our brands and our marketing efforts.
We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademarks, trade dress, domain name registrations, trade secrets and patent applications, as well as through contractual restrictions and reliance on federal, state and common law. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with employees, consultants, contractors and business partners, and employees and contractors are also subject to invention assignment provisions.
We have several registered trademarks in the United States (the most significant of which relate to our Angie’s List and HomeAdvisor brands), as well as other trademarks in Canada and Europe and several pending trademark applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions. We have also registered a variety of domestic and international domain names, the most significant of which relate to our HomeAdvisor and Angie’s List brands. In addition, we have one patent in the United States that expires in May 2019 and six patent applications pending in the United States.
Government Regulation 
We are subject to laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet generally and through mobile applications, including laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for their operations and the activities of their users. As a result, we could be subject to actions based on negligence, various torts and trademark and copyright infringement, among other actions.
In addition, because we receive, transmit, store and use a substantial amount of information received from or generated by consumers and service professionals, we are also impacted by laws and regulations governing privacy, the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal data and data breaches, primarily in the case of our European operations and the handling of personal data of consumers and service professionals located in the European Union. As a result, we could be subject to various private and governmental claims and actions, including under the General Data Protection Regulation, a comprehensive European Union privacy and data protection law that became effective in May 2018 (the "GDPR"). The GDPR, which applies to companies that are organized in the European Union or otherwise provide services to (or monitor) consumers who reside in the European Union, imposes strict standards regarding the sharing, storage, use, disclosure and protection of end user data, as well as significant penalties (monetary and otherwise) for non-compliance. The GDPR will continue to be interpreted by European Union data protection regulators, which may require that we make changes to our business practices, and could generate additional risks and liabilities. The European Union is also considering an update to its Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive to impose stricter rules regarding the use of cookies. In addition, the potential exit from the European Union by the United Kingdom could result in the application of new and conflicting data privacy and protection laws and standards to our operations in the United Kingdom and our handling of personal data of users located in the United Kingdom. Lastly, there are number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations recently passed or under consideration by the U.S. Congress, as well as in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which becomes effective January 1, 2020.

We are particularly sensitive to laws and regulations that adversely impact the popularity or growth in use of the Internet and/or online products and services generally, restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we provide our products and services, regulate the practices of third parties upon which we rely to provide our products and services and undermine open and neutrally administered Internet access. For example, in December 2017, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC") adopted an order reversing net neutrality protections in the United States, including the repeal of specific rules against blocking, throttling or "paid prioritization" of content or services by Internet service providers. To the extent Internet service providers take such actions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
As a provider of products and services with a membership-based element, we are also subject to laws and regulations in certain U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business that apply to membership payment models with auto-renewal provisions. Accordingly, we are sensitive to the adoption of any law or regulation affecting our ability to periodically charge for recurring membership or subscription payments, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the European Union Payment Services directive, which became effective in 2018, could impact the ability of our businesses to process auto-renewal payments for, as well offer promotional or differentiated pricing to, users who reside in the European Union. Similar new legislation or regulations, or changes to existing legislation or regulations governing subscription payments, are being considered in many U.S. states.
We are also sensitive to the adoption of new tax laws. The European Commission and several European countries have issued proposals that would change various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed, including proposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes (including taxes based on a percentage of revenue). For example, the United Kingdom has proposed a Digital Services Tax applicable to revenues of social media platforms, online marketplaces and search engines linked to users residing in the United Kingdom, which would likely apply to certain of our business. If enacted, one or more of these or similar proposed tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
We are also subject to laws governing marketing and advertising activities conducted by/through telephone, e-mail, mobile devices and the Internet, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the CAN-SPAM Act and similar state laws, as well as federal, state, and local laws and agency guidelines governing background screening.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 4,500 employees worldwide, the substantial majority of which provided services to our brands and businesses located in the United States. We believe that we generally have good relationships with our employees.

RELATIONSHIP WITH IAC
Equity Ownership and Vote
We have two classes of capital stock outstanding, Class A common stock and Class B common stock, with one vote and ten votes per share, respectively. Our shares of Class B common stock are convertible into shares of Class A common stock on a share for share basis. As of February 1, 2019, IAC owned 421,118,101 shares of Class B common stock, representing 100% of our outstanding Class B common stock, and did not own any shares of our Class A common stock. As of that date, IAC’s Class B common stock holdings represented approximately 83.5% of our total outstanding shares of capital stock and approximately 98.1% of the total combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock.
Intercompany Agreements
In connection with the Combination, we and IAC entered into certain agreements to govern our relationship following the Combination. These agreements include the following:
Contribution Agreement
Under the contribution agreement: (i) we agreed to assume all of the assets and liabilities related to the HomeAdvisor business and indemnify IAC against any losses arising out of any breach by us of the contribution agreement or any other transaction related agreement described below and (ii) IAC agreed to indemnify us against losses arising out of any breach by IAC of the contribution agreement or any other transaction related agreement described below.
Investor Rights Agreement
Under the investor rights agreement, IAC has certain registration, preemptive and governance rights related to us and the shares of our capital stock it holds. The investor rights agreement also provides certain governance rights for the benefit of stockholders other than IAC.
Services Agreement
The services agreement currently governs services that IAC has agreed to provide to us through September 29, 2019, with automatic renewal for successive one-year terms, subject to IAC’s continued ownership of a majority of the total combined voting power of our voting stock and any subsequent extension(s) or truncation(s) agreed to by us and IAC. Services currently provided to us by IAC pursuant this agreement include: (i) assistance with certain legal, M&A, human resources, finance, risk management, internal audit and treasury functions, health and welfare benefits, information security services and insurance and tax affairs, including assistance with certain public company and unclaimed property reporting obligations; (ii) accounting, controllership and payroll processing services; (iii) investor relations services and (iv) tax compliance services. The scope, nature and extent of services may be changed from time to time as we and IAC may agree.
Tax Sharing Agreement
The tax sharing agreement governs our and IAC’s rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, entitlements to refunds, preparation of tax returns, tax contests and other tax matters regarding U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes. Under the tax sharing agreement, we are generally responsible and required to indemnify IAC for: (i) all taxes imposed with respect to any consolidated, combined or unitary tax return of IAC or its subsidiaries that includes us or any of our subsidiaries (to the extent attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries, as determined under the tax sharing agreement) and (ii) all taxes imposed with respect to any consolidated, combined, unitary or separate tax returns of us or our subsidiaries.
Employee Matters Agreement
The employee matters agreement addresses certain compensation and benefit issues related to the allocation of liabilities associated with: (i) employment or termination of employment; (ii) employee benefit plans and (iii) equity awards. Under the employee matters agreement, our employees participate in IAC’s U.S. health and welfare plans, 401(k) plan and flexible benefits plan and we reimburse IAC for the costs of such participation. In the event IAC no longer retains shares representing at least 80% of the aggregate voting power of shares entitled to vote in the election of our board of directors, we will no longer participate in IAC’s employee benefit plans, but will establish our own employee benefit plans that will be substantially similar to the plans sponsored by IAC.
9

In addition, under the employee matters agreement, we are required to reimburse IAC for the cost of any IAC equity awards held by our current and former employees, with IAC electing to receive payment either in cash or shares of our Class B common stock. This agreement also provides that IAC may require stock appreciation rights granted prior the closing of the Combination and equity awards in our subsidiaries to be settled in either shares of our Class A common stock or IAC common stock. To the extent shares of IAC common stock are issued in settlement of these awards, we are obligated to reimburse IAC for the cost of those shares by issuing shares of our Class A common stock in the case of stock appreciation rights granted prior to the closing of the Combination and shares of our Class B common stock in the case of equity awards in our subsidiaries.
