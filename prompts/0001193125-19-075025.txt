Item 1. Business 
OVERVIEW 
 The Company designs, sources and sells branded kitchenware, tableware and other products used in the home and markets its products under a number of widely-recognized brand names and trademarks, which are either owned or licensed by the Company or through retailers private labels and their licensed brands. The Companys products, which are targeted primarily towards consumers purchasing moderately priced kitchenware, tableware and housewares, are sold through virtually every major level of trade. The Company generally markets several lines within each of its product categories under more than one brand. The Company sells its products directly to retailers (who may resell the Companys products through their Internet websites) and, to a lesser extent, to distributors. The Company also sells a limited selection of its products directly to consumers through its own Internet websites. 
 The Companys product categories include two categories of products used to prepare, serve and consume foods, Kitchenware (kitchen tools and gadgets, cutlery, kitchen scales, thermometers, cutting boards, shears, cookware, pantryware, spice racks and bakeware) and Tableware (dinnerware, stemware, flatware and giftware); and one category, Home Solutions, which comprises other products used in the home (thermal beverageware, bath scales, weather and outdoor household products, food storage, neoprene travel products and home décor). 
 The Company continually evaluates opportunities to expand the reach of its brands and to invest in other companies, both foreign and domestic, that own or license complementary brands. In 2018, the Company made significant progress in this initiative and in March 2018, pursuant to a merger agreement, the Company completed the acquisition of Taylor Holdco LLC and its subsidiaries (dba Filament Brands, and which the Company refers to as Filament). Filament primarily designs, markets and distributes consumer and food service precision measurement products (including kitchen scales, thermometers and timers), bath scales, wine accessories, kitchen tools, and hydration products, and select outdoor products to major retailers in the United States, Canada and select distributors throughout Europe and Asia. Filament distributes products under the Taylor, Salter, Springfield, HoMedics, Rabbit, Houdini, Metrokane, Mako, EatSmart, TravelWise, Chefn, Vibe, d.stil, RBT and private label brand names. Pursuant to the acquisition of Filament, the Company issued approximately 27% of its then-outstanding shares to Taylor Parent, LLC (Taylor Parent), and entered into a stockholders agreement (the Stockholders Agreement) with Taylor Parent, pursuant to which Taylor Parent has the right to: (i) designate up to two persons for nomination for election or appointment to the Companys Board of Directors, for so long as Taylor Parent beneficially owns at least 20% of the outstanding common stock of the Company on a fully diluted basis and (ii) designate one person for nomination for election or appointment to the Companys Board of Directors, for so long as Taylor Parent beneficially owns more than 10% of the outstanding common stock of the Company on a fully diluted basis. The other rights granted to Taylor Parent under the Stockholders Agreement are discussed in greater detail under Item 1A, Risk Factors, below. 
 The Company has a presence in international markets through subsidiaries and affiliate companies that are based outside of the United States. Lifetime Brands Europe Limited is a wholly-owned subsidiary trading as Kitchen Craft. Kitchen Craft is a leading supplier of kitchenware and tableware products and accessories in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and in over 80 other countries. The Company has been working to consolidate the operations of Lifetime Brands Europe Limited to create operational efficiencies and expects this to be completed in 2019. Beginning in 2019, Lifetime Brands Europe Limiteds brand development and design teams, as well as distribution and administrative teams, will be combined and operated out of one state of the art facility. This restructuring is expected to drive new product development while meeting consumer needs. 
 The Company also has a subsidiary in the Peoples Republic of China (China) to supply kitchenware and tableware products to the Chinese market and a subsidiary based in Hong Kong to facilitate the sale of its products to other parts of Asia and smaller markets elsewhere in the world. The Company has a presence in Mexico and other parts of Latin America (excluding Brazil) through its 30% equity interest in Grupo Vasconia, S.A.B. (Vasconia), a housewares company and aluminum manufacturer based in Mexico, and a strategic alliance with a Canadian company to distribute many of the Companys products in Canada.

COMPETITION 
 The markets for kitchenware, tableware and other products used in the home including home décor products are highly competitive and include numerous domestic and foreign competitors, some of which are larger than the Company. The primary competitive factors in selling such products are innovative products, brand, quality, aesthetic appeal to consumers, packaging, breadth of product line, distribution capability and selling price. 
PATENTS AND LICENSES 
 The Company owns approximately 750 design and utility patents. The Company does not believe that the expiration of any of its patents would have a material adverse effect on either of the Companys segments.

The Company originally entered into a licensing arrangement for use of the KitchenAid brand in 2000, and has renewed the license, typically for three-year periods, since that time.
