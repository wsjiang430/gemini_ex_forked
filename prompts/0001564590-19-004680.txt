Overview 
 We are a leading genome editing company focused on developing curative therapeutics utilizing a biological tool known as CRISPR/Cas9, which stands for Clustered, Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (“CRISPR”)/CRISPR associated 9 (“Cas9”). This is a technology for genome editing, the process of altering selected sequences of genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”). We believe that CRISPR/Cas9 technology has the potential to transform medicine by editing disease-associated genes with a single treatment course, and it can also be used to create novel engineered cell therapies that can replace a patient’s diseased cells or effectively target various cancers and autoimmune diseases. We are leveraging our leading scientific expertise, clinical development experience and intellectual property (“IP”) position to unlock a broad set of therapeutic applications for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and to develop a potential new class of therapeutic products.
 We aim to build a long-term company to fulfill our mission to develop curative genome editing treatments that can positively transform the lives of people living with severe and life-threating disease. We believe we can deliver on our mission and provide long-term benefits for all of our stakeholders by focusing on the following key elements - 
  
• | Develop curative CRISPR/Cas9 based medicines;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | Advance our science to help more patients;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | Foster an environment that is the best place to make therapies; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focus on long-term sustainability.
--+-----------------------------------

 Our strategy is to build a full-spectrum genome editing company, by leveraging our CRISPR/Cas9 platform across two areas: in vivo applications, in which CRISPR/Cas9 is the therapy, delivered to target cells within the body; and ex vivo applications, in which CRISPR/Cas9 creates the therapy of engineered human cells. 
 The breadth of our CRISPR/Cas9 platform and delivery technology allows us to pursue a multitude of therapeutic targets/clinical indications. Specifically, we can target diseases that have the potential to be addressed by directly editing specific genes (i.e., gene knockout, repair, or insertion) as well as diseases that may be targeted by genetically engineered cell therapies. The successful treatment of these disorders may require various types of genome edits, CRISPR/Cas9 elements and DNA templates. We have assembled multiple in vivo and engineered cell therapy capabilities into an early pipeline that reflects our full-spectrum approach and leverages the modularity inherent in our platform.
 Our pipeline includes in vivo proprietary programs targeting genetic diseases, including transthyretin amyloidosis (“ATTR”), which we are co-developing with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Regeneron”), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (“AATD”), and other disorders such as primary hyperoxaluria (“PH1”). Our ex vivo programs consist of two separate efforts: 1) a set of proprietary programs focused on engineered cell therapies to treat various cancers and autoimmune diseases, and 2) partnered programs developed in collaboration with Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc. (“Novartis” or “NIBR”), focused on chimeric antigen receptor T cells (“CAR-T cells”), hematopoietic stem cells (“HSCs”), the stem cells from which all of the various types of blood cells originate, and stem cells in the eye, or ocular stem cells (“OSCs”).
 CRISPR/Cas9 Technology
 CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology was derived from an adaptive defense mechanism of bacteria. In 2012 Dr. Jennifer Doudna, one of our scientific co-founders, and her colleagues published a paper in the journal Science describing the use of CRISPR/Cas9 as a genome editing tool. Genome editing is the precise and targeted modification of the genetic material of cells or viruses. The Cas9 endonuclease, a key component of CRISPR/Cas9, can be programmed to cut double-stranded DNA at specific locations. A ribonucleic acid (“RNA”) molecule, called a guide RNA (“gRNA”), binds to Cas9 and can be programmed to direct the Cas9 enzyme to a specific DNA sequence.

The CRISPR/Cas9 system offers a revolutionary approach for therapeutic development due to its broad potential to precisely edit the genome. This system can be used to make three general types of edits: knockouts, repairs and insertions. Each of these editing strategies takes advantage of naturally-occurring biological mechanisms to effect the desired genetic alteration. Products based on CRISPR/Cas9 technology may be one of two types: products where CRISPR itself constitutes the therapy and the edit occurs in vivo, and products where CRISPR is used to create the therapy, where the edit occurs ex vivo. In vivo editing has the potential to provide curative therapeutic options for patients with genetically-based diseases, while ex vivo editing has potential to create cell-based therapies to combat cancer, or autoimmune diseases.
 Strategy 
 Our goal is to build a full spectrum, fully integrated, product-driven biotechnology company, focused on developing and commercializing curative CRISPR/Cas9-based therapeutics. Our approach to advancing the broad potential of genome editing includes plans to: 
 Focus on Indications that Enable Us to Fully Develop the Potential of the CRISPR/Cas9 System. To maximize our opportunity to rapidly develop clinically successful products, we have applied a risk-mitigated approach to selecting indications with significant unmet medical needs based on four primary criteria: 
  
• | the type of edit: knockout, repair or insertion;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | the delivery modality for in vivo and ex vivo applications;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | the existence of efficient regulatory pathways to approval; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | the potential for the CRISPR/Cas9 system to provide therapeutic benefits when compared to existing therapeutic options.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe these selection criteria position us to build a diversified pipeline, in which we are not reliant on any single delivery technology or editing approach for success. In addition, we believe we can apply the learnings from our current programs to inform our selection of additional indications and targets of interest. We are also exploring ways to identify potential new therapeutic targets suitable for modulation with the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We believe this approach serves to increase the probabilities of success in our initial indications, generate insights that will accelerate the development of additional therapeutic products and broaden the opportunity for potential strategic alliances. 
 Aggressively Pursue In Vivo Liver Indications to Develop Therapeutics Rapidly with Our Proprietary Delivery System. For our in vivo indications, we selected well-validated targets in diseases with significant unmet medical needs where there are predictive biomarkers, or measurable indicators of a biological condition or state, with strong disease correlation and where the CRISPR/Cas9 technology and delivery tools existing today could be applied towards developing a novel therapeutic. Our initial in vivo pipeline opportunities target diseases of the liver, which we believe we can address using our proprietary lipid nanoparticle (“LNP”) delivery system. The first in vivo indications that we are evaluating include ATTR, AATD and PH1.
 Actively Develop and Expand Ex Vivo Therapeutic Programs. We are independently researching and developing proprietary engineered cell therapies to treat various cancers and autoimmune diseases, for example using T cell receptor (“TCR”)-engineered T cells for immuno-oncology applications, engineered regulatory T cells for autoimmune disorders and other cell types such as engineered induced pluripotent stem cells for these potential applications. Further, in collaboration with Novartis, we are researching CAR-T cell, HSC and OSC applications. 
 Continue to Leverage Strategic Partnerships to Accelerate Clinical Development. We view strategic partnerships as important drivers for accelerating the achievement of our goal of rapidly developing curative therapies. The potential application of CRISPR/Cas9 is extremely broad, and we plan to continue to identify partners who can contribute meaningful resources and insights to our programs and allow us to more rapidly bring scientific innovation to a broader patient population. Our partnership focusing on HSCs, OSCs and CAR-T cells with Novartis, an industry leader with the first commercially available CAR-T product, our collaboration on in vivo liver indications with Regeneron, a leader in genetics-driven drug discovery and development, and our research collaboration initiated in 2017 on engineered T cell therapies with Ospedale San Raffaele (“OSR”), a leading European research-university hospital, exemplify this strategy.

Grow Our Leadership Position in the Field of Genome Editing. We are committed to broadening our capabilities to remain at the cutting edge of genome editing research. We will continue to invest internally in developing our platform capabilities, including innovative delivery modalities, technologies and tools to advance our therapeutic programs. We will also systematically explore accessing external technologies or opportunities to enhance our leadership position in developing innovative therapeutics. 
 Our Platform 
 An integral part of creating a full-spectrum therapeutic product pipeline based on CRISPR/Cas9 technology is to develop a robust technology platform, based on proprietary and in-licensed technologies. Our modular platform has been built with components that serve both in vivo and ex vivo programs, as well as delivery technologies that can serve either in vivo or ex vivo programs. In addition to the components described below, we are developing robust, high volume (high-throughput) capabilities centering around enabling strategic target identification and validation that we believe will provide us with a competitive advantage in creating successful therapeutic products. 
Informatics 
 We have built a high-throughput, scalable data processing and analysis, or informatics, infrastructure to support various aspects of our platform, including gRNA selection and evaluation of on- and off-target editing in cells. Depending on the desired editing strategy, we use proprietary bioinformatics methods to design candidate guides and select those that we believe to both be highly specific and have high cutting efficiency. As we grow our experimental data set, we continue to incorporate guide performance into our algorithms to improve their predictive power. 
 Guide RNA qualification 
 As part of the process to identify gRNAs for potential development candidates, we screen numerous gRNAs for their ability to generate the required edit at the genomic site of interest, called on-target activity, as well as any propensity to generate unwanted events at other sites in the genome, also known as off-target activity. To evaluate on-target activity, we use high-throughput sequencing methods to analyze the genomes of edited cells, allowing us to assess overall editing efficiency and to examine the nature of the editing events, such as specific insertions or deletions. 
 For gRNAs selected through our primary on-target screens, we perform a variety of analyses to look for possible off-target editing events, including bioinformatic predictions and experimental methods. Part of our approach involves identifying candidates with no or few off-target sites based on experimental measurements of genome-wide DNA breaks, as well as targeted sequencing of such candidate sites to evaluate actual off-target editing events in relevant cell types. We continue to optimize our gRNA qualification capability over time by increasing our throughput, improving our off-target activity detection accuracy and increasing our bioinformatics predictive accuracy. 
 Guide RNA format 
 CRISPR/Cas9 systems can function with gRNAs having a variety of modifications, such as changes to the physical gRNA structure or chemical modifications of nucleotides. As part of our development of CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutics, we are engineering modified gRNAs to, for example, improve editing efficiency, specificity and stability inside cells, as well as to reduce the likelihood of an immune response. We believe our work in this area will allow us to develop the most appropriate guides for therapeutic applications. 
 7


Nuclease 
 Our current preferred Cas9 protein is derived from a species of bacteria called S. pyogenes (Spy), which is the Cas9 used in the vast majority of published CRISPR/Cas9 literature to date. As part of the therapeutic development process, we are adapting and engineering Spy Cas9 with the goal of improving its specificity, activity and manufacturability. In addition, we are exploring other naturally-occurring Cas9 proteins and nucleases from other organisms, which may differ from Spy Cas9 in aspects such as specificity, size or mechanism of DNA cutting. We are pursuing these alternative Cas9 forms and other nucleases through ongoing internal work, by collaborating with our existing partners and scientific founders and by in-licensing opportunities. We are also investigating targeted modifications of Cas9 that can modulate DNA activity by mechanisms other than cleavage. We believe that different therapeutic applications may be best addressed using different forms of Cas9 or other nucleases, depending on the target cell or tissue of interest, the delivery method and the desired type of edit. 
 Cas9 edit type 
 The CRISPR/Cas9 system, by itself, primarily functions to cut DNA, while the resulting desired therapeutic editing events are performed by the cell, subsequent to the cut, as the cell seeks to rejoin the cut ends. One type of edit is caused by a DNA repair mechanism that is prone to losing or adding short lengths of DNA around the cut site. The changes in the DNA impairs the function of any encoded protein, causing a knockout edit. Using a combination of our informatics, gRNA qualification and format and nuclease platform capabilities, we have developed an efficient process to identify gRNAs that create this kind of edit at high frequency while possessing high specificity for the on-target site and no substantial off-target effects.
 While knockout edits can be made using solely a Cas9 protein and guide RNA, other kinds of editing, involving repair and insertion, additionally require a template DNA that contains a desired sequence that may be inserted or used to correct the original sequence. For ex vivo applications, the DNA template may be delivered by electroporation in combination with a Cas9-guide RNA complex, or by other means such as viral vectors. For in vivo applications, we have developed combination approaches for delivering the editing machinery by LNP, and the repair and insertion templates by adeno-associated viral (“AAV”) vectors. For example, in our collaboration with Regeneron, using such a combination LNP-AAV insertion delivery system in mice, we achieved blood levels of human Factor IX (“FIX”) protein, produced by an inserted F9 gene, corresponding to levels higher than those required in a clinical setting, after a single dose. FIX is a blood-clotting protein that is missing or defective in hemophilia B patients.
 In vivo delivery 
 We are focusing our initial in vivo applications in the liver, where we deliver the CRISPR/Cas9 therapy to patients using our proprietary LNP platform. 
 LNPs encapsulate the therapeutic cargo, providing it with stability, selective delivery, improved pharmacologic properties and controlled circulation time. Our therapeutic cargo is designed to degrade relatively quickly, resulting in transient expression of Cas9. We see multiple advantages of using LNPs as an in vivo delivery vehicle, particularly as optimized by us for delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system or its components. First, certain LNPs have historically demonstrated efficacy, safety and favorable tolerability and are currently used as a delivery system for therapeutic messenger RNA (“mRNA”), as well as small interfering RNA (“siRNA”).  mRNA is RNA that encodes proteins and siRNA is RNA that causes the degradation of selected cellular mRNAs. Additionally, LNPs are chemically well-defined and have a completely synthetic route of manufacture, which permits greater scalability. We are currently advancing our programs using our proprietary LNP delivery system, which uses a set of biodegradable, well-tolerated lipids, based on lipids originally developed by Novartis and in-licensed by us for use with all genome editing technologies, including CRISPR/Cas9 products. To date, we have successfully demonstrated well-tolerated in vivo editing in various animal models, including in mouse, rat and non-human primate (“NHP”) livers, with a single dose of systemically delivered LNPs. We have also shown successful delivery to cells in the brains of mice and NHPs, and editing in mouse brain cells using CRISPR/Cas9 delivered by direct injection of one of our proprietary LNP formulations.

With our team’s expertise in LNP delivery technology, we expect to be able to translate the LNPs that we are using for our preclinical evaluation to clinical development in humans. In addition, we are exploring options for incorporating Cas9 into therapeutic products in multiple formats. For example, Cas9 can be delivered in its protein form or could be delivered as a nucleic acid, such as an mRNA. For delivery of Cas9 mRNA, we have identified, and continue to investigate, modifications that may improve expression and stability, as well as reduce the potential for an immune response. We plan to continue to further improve on our LNP system for a variety of CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutic components, including templates for repair and insertion edits. In parallel, we are exploring additional delivery vehicles, including synthetic particles and viral vectors.  We are also developing delivery strategies that we believe will allow us to target other tissues such as the central nervous system, eye, muscle and other organs. 
 Ex vivo delivery 
 Cellular therapies are based on the administration of engineered human cells that are modified to provide or restore necessary functions in the cells of patients, or to target and eliminate cells with harmful attributes, such as cancer cells.  The cells to be modified ex vivo can come from the individual patient (autologous source) or from another individual (allogeneic source). We use the CRISPR/Cas9 system to perform the modification, and deliver the system using a clinically proven method, electroporation, which is an electrical charge-based technique for delivering molecules into cells. In this application, CRISPR creates the therapy ex vivo. In human cells, we have been able to achieve robustly high editing efficiency, including rates greater than 90 percent, of both copies of a single gene (bi-allelic editing), while preserving cell viability. In parallel, we are exploring other delivery methods for ex vivo introduction of biological material to cells, which may provide advantages such as delivery efficiency. 
 We have also simultaneously targeted multiple genes in an ex vivo setting and achieved high bi-allelic editing rates for both genes, demonstrating what we believe to be therapeutically relevant editing of multiple genes simultaneously (multiplex editing). The ability to achieve multiplex editing may be critical in targeting certain diseases. 
 Our Pipeline
 Our current pipeline includes in vivo and ex vivo programs.  Our in vivo programs focus on treating diseases attributable to genes expressed in the liver that have significant unmet medical needs – ATTR (which we are co-developing with Regeneron), AATD, and PH1. Delivery plays a key role in our in vivo therapeutic approach. We have shown in animal models that our proprietary LNP delivery technology, which encapsulates the therapeutic Cas9 mRNA and gRNA into LNPs, can systemically deliver these therapeutic components to the liver.
 For ex vivo applications, our wholly owned programs focus on next-generation, engineered cell therapy solutions that utilize antigen specific TCRs. Our goal for the ex vivo pipeline is to move from autologous to allogeneic therapies, and from blood to solid tumors. Other ex vivo programs, which are partnered with Novartis, use CRISPR/Cas9 to research potentially allogeneic CAR-T cell therapies, as well as engineered HSC and OSC product candidates. 
 We believe our full spectrum approach to in vivo and ex vivo programs positions us to build a pipeline across a wide range of indications.

The following table summarizes the status of our most advanced programs: 
 

in vivo programs
 
Our selection criteria include identifying diseases that originate in the liver, have well-defined mutations that can be addressed by a single knockout, repair or insertion approach, have readily measurable therapeutic endpoints with observable clinical responses, and for which effective treatments are absent, limited or unduly burdensome. Our initial in vivo indications target genetic liver diseases, including ATTR, AATD and PH1. Our current efforts on in vivo delivery focus on the use of LNPs for delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 complex to the liver.
 Genetic diseases:
 Transthyretin Amyloidosis (“ATTR”) Program 
 Background
 ATTR is a progressive and fatal disorder resulting from deposition of insoluble amyloid fibrils into multiple organs and tissues leading to systemic failure. Blood-borne transthyretin protein (“TTR”) is produced by hepatocytes and normally circulates as a soluble homotetramer that facilitates transport of vitamin A, via retinol binding protein (“RBP”), as well as the thyroid hormone, thyroxine. Mutations in the TTR gene lead to the production of TTR proteins that are destabilized in their tetramer form. These tetramers more readily dissociate into the monomeric form, and thence to an aggregative form that results in amyloid deposits in tissues. These deposits cause damage in those tissues, resulting in a disorder known as hereditary TTR amyloidosis (“hATTR”). Over 120 different genetic mutations are currently known to cause hATTR. 
 Deposits of TTR amyloid in the heart, nerves, and/or other tissues can lead to diverse symptoms, often including peripheral neuropathy and/or cardiomyopathy.  Historically, hereditary TTR amyloidosis with peripheral neuropathy (“hATTR-PN”) was known as familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (“FAP”), whereas hereditary TTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (“hATTR-CM”) was known as familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (“FAC”). Typical onset of disease symptoms is during adulthood and can be fatal within two to 15 years. Estimates suggest that approximately 50,000 patients suffer from hATTR worldwide.
 10


In addition to the hereditary forms described above, ATTR can also develop spontaneously in the absence of any TTR gene mutation. This wildtype disease (“wtATTR”), also known as senile systemic amyloidosis, is increasingly being recognized as a significant and often undiagnosed cause of heart failure in the elderly and is the subject of active investigation. Recent estimates suggest that, globally, between 200,000 and 500,000 people may suffer from wildtype TTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (“wtATTR-CM”). 
 Limitations of current treatment options
 Currently, there are two therapies for the treatment hATTR-PN approved in the United States (“U.S.”) and the European Union (“EU”), and a third approved in various markets outside the U.S. and EU. While these therapies have shown the potential to slow or halt the progression of neuropathic symptoms, and in some patients lead to an improvement in symptoms, their approved prescribing instructions require them to be administered chronically for the life of the patient in order to sustain benefit. Additionally, patient response to these therapies varies. While some patients may experience symptomatic improvement after being treated with these therapies, the disease continues to progress in many of the treated patients, which highlights the continued need for efficacious and potentially curative therapies. Currently, no therapies are approved for cardiomyopathy resulting from TTR amyloidosis (“ATTR-CM”).
 Our Approach
 We believe that we can apply CRISPR/Cas9 technology to potentially cure ATTR by disabling the TTR gene in the liver. We expect this approach to greatly reduce or eliminate the production of the TTR protein, which should slow or stop the accumulation of protein in the nerves and the heart, thereby halting disease progression. Current treatments and ongoing clinical trials in hATTR-PN have shown a significant correlation between TTR protein reduction and clinical benefit. Additionally, these studies suggest that loss of TTR gene expression from the liver would be well-tolerated in adult humans. Accordingly, we believe targeting TTR genes with CRISPR/Cas9 may improve patient outcomes by potentially eliminating defective TTR protein in a single or small number of treatments, as opposed to life-long therapy. We have assessed delivery of gRNAs directed at the TTR gene via LNPs and have achieved high levels of liver cell editing in vitro and in vivo as well as reduction of serum TTR protein in multiple non-human species.
 
In our NHP studies, we have demonstrated our ability to lower circulating TTR protein after a single systemic administration of LNPs containing CRISPR/Cas9 cargo.  In recent NHP studies using further improved LNP delivery system components, we observed TTR protein reduction of more than 95 percent, a reduction that has been associated with human clinical benefit using other treatment modalities. Data from NHP studies demonstrated a high correlation between liver editing and reduction of TTR. In our various studies, we have also observed durability of liver editing and reduction of circulating TTR protein in NHPs for over six months. The data from our various NHP studies has also demonstrated the transient nature of Intellia’s proprietary modular LNP delivery system, which was rapidly cleared from circulation, with all CRISPR/Cas9 components undetectable in blood and liver within ten days of administration. 
 
We intend shortly to complete dose-range finding studies and scale-up activities, and initiate IND-enabling toxicology studies. The resulting data, and the formulation utilized to achieve the results previously discussed, will be the basis of our investigational new drug (“IND”) candidate, on track for submission in 2020.
 Clinical Development Pathway 
 Our first in-human studies in ATTR are expected to take place in patients with ATTR who have started to exhibit symptoms related to amyloid deposition. The primary objective of these studies will be to show that the therapy can be delivered safely to the patient. A secondary objective will be to identify early indicators of efficacy, which may include reductions in TTR protein levels in blood. We expect that the results of our preclinical studies, and discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) and other relevant regulatory agencies as well as patient advocacy groups will be important in informing our trial design. Pursuant to our collaboration agreement, we and Regeneron entered into a co-development and co-promotion agreement directed to the first collaboration target, TTR, under which we will be the clinical and commercial lead.

Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Program (“AATD”)  
 Background
 AATD is an inherited genetic disorder that may cause lung and/or liver disease. The lung disease may result in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”), a progressive disorder that causes substantial morbidity and mortality. The liver disease, which is less common, is characterized by inflammation and cirrhosis of the liver. In the United States (“U.S.”), an estimated 60,000 to 100,000 people have AATD, which is the result of a mutation in the SERPINA1 gene that normally produces alpha-1 antitrypsin (“A1AT”) protein that is secreted into the blood. A1AT is a protease inhibitor that blocks the activity of various enzymes such as neutrophil elastase, which is an enzyme that fights infections, but when not adequately controlled by A1AT, can attack normal tissues, such as lung tissue. 
 The most common form of AATD arises when a patient has a mutation in both copies of the SERPINA1 gene, which causes A1AT to aggregate inside liver hepatocytes, rather than being secreted from the liver. The inability to secrete A1AT from the liver leaves the lung unprotected from neutrophil elastase and can result in pulmonary disease. The pulmonary consequences of AATD can sometimes culminate in COPD. Estimates suggest that between one and two percent of all cases of COPD in the United States have AATD as the underlying cause. In some instances of the disease, A1AT accumulates in the liver, causing liver inflammation and cirrhosis, which leads to liver damage, scarring and in the most severe cases, liver failure or cancer. Liver disease associated with AATD is diagnosed from infancy to adulthood, whereas lung disease is most common in adult patients.
 Limitations of current treatment options
 In addition to symptomatic therapies, the primary treatment for the pulmonary symptoms of AATD is alpha-1 antitrypsin replacement (also known as alpha1-proteinase inhibitor or A1-PI) or “augmentation” therapy.  In the U.S., there are several brands of replacement therapy approved for augmentation and maintenance therapy for AATD, but the impact on clinical outcomes is controversial. Further, replacement therapy is typically associated with chronic, weekly intravenous infusions.  Patients with severe disease are sometimes treated with lung volume reduction surgery or lung transplantation, procedures associated with significant morbidity and potential mortality.
 There are currently no specific treatments available for A1AT-associated liver disease and management is supportive in nature. Liver transplant represents a last-line option for patients with end-stage liver disease, but is a procedure associated with significant morbidity and potential mortality.
 Our Approach
 We have demonstrated continued progression of our modular LNP delivery platform capability to knock out various liver targets of interest in mice, including SERPINA1 for liver dysfunction associated with AATD. To date, we have achieved 85 percent editing of hepatic SERPINA1 in a mouse model bearing the human SERPINA1 gene, leading to an approximately 95 percent reduction of the encoded A1AT protein. This approach could be effective in treating the liver manifestations of the disease.
 In October 2018, at the 26th Annual Congress of the European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (“ESGCT”), we reported our progress in advancing an insertion strategy for AATD that could be beneficial for the lung manifestations of the disease. We combined our modular LNP delivery system for CRISPR/Cas9 with a new, proprietary modular AAV bidirectional insertion template to demonstrate robust, efficient CRISPR-mediated targeted insertion of donor template DNA encoding the human SERPINA1 gene into liver cells, following systemic administration of these editing components. The insertion resulted in A1AT blood protein levels in mice that were within the normal human physiological range.

Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (“PH1”) Program 
 Background
 The primary hyperoxalurias are a group of autosomal recessive disorders that are associated with the overproduction of oxalate, a highly insoluble end-product of metabolism that is excreted almost entirely by the kidneys. The overproduction of oxalate leads to the recurrent formation of kidney and bladder stones as well as progressive renal damage (caused by a combination of nephrotoxicity induced by oxalate, obstructions caused by kidney stones and often superimposed infection). This progressive renal damage typically results in chronic kidney disease and ultimately end stage renal disease (“ESRD”).
 Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (“PH1”), one of three types of primary hyperoxaluria, is caused by a deficiency of the liver-specific peroxisomal enzyme alanineglyoxylate aminotransferase (“AGT”), which results in the accumulation of glyoxylate and excessive production of both oxalate and glycolate. PH1 is the most common form of primary hyperoxaluria, accounting for approximately 80 percent of cases, and it has an estimated prevalence of 1-3 cases per million population. PH1 can occur at almost any age, but typically presents during childhood.  While kidney stone formation is often the first sign of disease, 20 to 50 percent of patients have advanced chronic kidney disease or even ESRD at the time of diagnosis.  Data from the Rare Kidney Stone Consortium indicate that the median age at diagnosis of ESRD is 24 years, highlighting the progressive nature the disease.
 Limitations of current treatment options
 Currently, there are no cures for primary hyperoxaluria. Preemptive liver transplantation prior to the onset of kidney damage represents the only definitive “cure” for primary hyperoxaluria. However, given the morbidity and potential mortality associated with the procedure, preemptive liver transplantation is controversial.  Beyond this, treatment for PH1 is supportive in nature, with the goal of reducing kidney stone formation and/or preserving renal function for as long as possible. Treatment (shockwave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, or percutaneous nephrolithotomy) may be required to treat kidney stones and dialysis is required to treat patients who develop end stage renal disease. Kidney transplantation, ideally in combination with liver transplantation, may also be considered for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, although 5-year survival rates for patients undergoing combined kidney and liver transplant are still below 65 percent. The lack of curative therapies beyond preemptive approaches has led to enduring unmet need.
 Our Approach
 Our therapeutic approach is to knock out the gene HAO1, which is involved in the metabolic pathway for oxalate production, thereby reducing the level of blood glyoxylate and in turn urinary oxalate. In initial studies in a mouse model of hyperoxaluria, we achieved approximately 80 percent editing of HAO1, leading to an approximately 45 percent reduction in urinary oxalate after a single dose of LNPs formulated with CRISPR/Cas9 cargo targeting the Hao1 gene. We have also observed up to 90 percent reduction in the protein expressed by HAO1 in a wild type mouse. Across our liver pipeline, these levels of editing achieved using similar formulations reinforce the modular nature of our LNP delivery platform, featuring efficient and effective delivery to hepatocytes.
 Ex Vivo Pipeline
We are independently researching and developing proprietary engineered cell therapies to treat various oncological and autoimmune diseases, for example TCR-engineered T cells for immuno-oncology applications and engineered regulatory T cells for autoimmune disorders.  Our diverse product strategy includes multiple elements.  In particular:

• | We seek to develop allogeneic cellular therapies, which are those derived from unmatched donors and modified outside of the human body to allow them to be administered to an unrelated patient.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 13


 
• | Outside our Novartis collaboration, we are exploring non-CAR-T cellular approaches that use immune cells, including T cells expressing recombinant TCRs, for oncology indications. For example, in our existing collaboration with OSR, we are identifying optimized TCRs recognizing a tumor target that could be used to treat certain cancers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are also exploring methods to apply CRISPR/Cas9 editing to CD4 cells to induce a non-reverting regulatory T cell phenotype, to create therapies that address auto-immune diseases.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For our ex vivo programs requiring delivery to isolated cells such as HSCs or T cells, we initially plan to deliver the CRISPR/Cas9 complex by electroporation. We are also exploring alternative technologies that may provide advantages in delivery efficiency or cell viability. 
 Acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”)
 Background
 AML includes a heterogenous group of blood cancers arising from the malignant expansion of hematopoietic cells of the myeloid lineage.  AML is associated with weakness, fatigue, and bleeding resulting from the depletion of healthy myeloid cells, and is typically rapidly progressive and fatal without immediate treatment. AML is an aggressive and hard-to-treat cancer, resulting in an overall five-year survival of less than 30 percent.  AML is the most common acute leukemia in adults and is associated with the largest number of annual deaths from leukemia in the U.S.  Specifically, it is estimated that there will be approximately 20,000 new cases of AML in the U.S. in 2019 as well as more than 10,000 deaths.  While AML can occur at any age, the prevalence of the disease increases with age, resulting in a median age at diagnosis of 67 years.
 Limitations of current treatment options
 Induction chemotherapy, most commonly with cytarabine and an anthracycline, represents the preferred first-line treatment option for patients who are young and fit enough to tolerate an “intensive” treatment regimen. Patients who achieve remission with induction typically receive additional chemotherapy or an HSC transplant as consolidation therapy. While this treatment approach has the potential to lead to sustained remission or even cure, the intensity of these treatments is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Patients who are older and/or unfit, who represent a significant proportion of the patient population, are often unable to be treated with an intensive regimen and are commonly treated with lower intensity chemotherapy or hypomethylating agents. While these therapies offer the potential to prolong survival and address some of the clinical symptomatology associated with AML, they are not generally considered to be potentially curative treatments. Even among patients who are considered fit enough to receive an intensive regimen, a significant proportion of patients are refractory (i.e., do not achieve a complete remission). Further, relapse is common even among those patients who achieve a remission. While additional lines of treatment may be possible, cure rates are extremely low among relapsed and refractory patients. Combined, the high percentage of patients who are unable to tolerate an intensive potentially-curative regimen, the high percentage of refractory patients and high relapse rates have led to the low overall survival rate in AML patients.
 Over the past several years, several new treatments have emerged for AML with different mechanism of action. While these treatments have led to improvements in response rates and in some cases increased overall survival, the outcomes demonstrated thus far have been incremental in nature and long-term outcomes in AML continue to be extremely poor.
 Our approach
 In May 2018, we announced that our first engineered cell therapy target is an epitope of the WT1 protein, for the treatment of AML and other potential hematological malignancies, as well as for solid tumors. This work is being done in collaboration with our academic partner, OSR. 
 14


At the ESGCT meeting in October 2018, we and our collaborator OSR shared an update on our progress in this program with the presentation of data showing that CRISPR/Cas9 editing in T cells could achieve over 90 percent knockout of endogenous TCRs. In addition, we showed that after insertion of WT1-specific TCRs, the engineered T cells were fully functional and capable of specifically killing approximately 40 percent of leukemic blasts from a patient that expressed the WT1 epitope. We continue to develop engineered T cells to treat AML as part of our wholly owned ex vivo product pipeline based on these novel TCRs and our genome editing technology. This work will be the foundation for our first wholly owned ex vivo engineered cell therapy development candidate for the treatment of AML, which we expect to nominate by the end of 2019.
 CAR-T Cell, HSC and OSC Research Collaboration with Novartis 
 Under our collaboration agreement with Novartis, we received an upfront technology access payment from Novartis of $10.0 million, and we are entitled to up to an additional $40.0 million, in aggregate, in additional technology access fees and research payments during the five-year collaboration term, subject to certain credits and adjustments in favor of Novartis. In addition, we received a $10.0 million payment relating to the expansion of the collaboration to include OSCs. Further, we are eligible to earn up to $230.3 million in development, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments and mid-single-digit royalties, in each case, on a per-product basis for the products developed by Novartis, subject to certain target-based limitations. For more information regarding our ongoing collaboration with Novartis, see the section below entitled “Collaborations—Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc.”
 CAR-T Cell Program
In 2017, the first CAR-T cell products, including Novartis’ Kymriah, were approved by the FDA to treat certain oncological indications such as pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”) and Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (“NHL”). Additional therapies are being developed for blood cancers such as AML, multiple myeloma (“MML”) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”), as well as several other solid-tumor cancers. In CAR-T cell therapy, naturally-occurring immune cells, specifically T cells, are modified ex vivo by inserting a CAR into the T cells, thereby redirecting their response towards cancer cells. 
 CAR-T cell products can benefit from the application of CRISPR/Cas9 in multiple ways. 
  
• | CRISPR/Cas9 could be used to create a universal donor CAR-T cell by knocking out cell surface markers that cause a patient’s immune system to recognize another person’s cells as foreign. Allowing multiple patients to be treated using cells from a single donor could significantly streamline manufacturing and make CAR-T cell therapy more widely accessible.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | CRISPR/Cas9 could be used to modify the T cells to enhance their survival or activity against cancer cells.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | CRISPR/Cas9 could be used to introduce the CAR into a precise location in the genome with a specific integrated copy number, as opposed to the current method involving semi-random integration, thus potentially improving the safety profile of the resulting cells.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | CRISPR/Cas9 could be used to knock out one or more of the proteins believed to be responsible for certain serious side effects that can result in dangerously high fevers or severe loss of blood pressure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We could potentially combine two or more of these approaches to further enhance CAR-T cell therapy.

HSC Program 
 HSCs are the stem cells from which all of the various types of blood cells originate. The HSCs present in transplanted bone marrow, mobilized peripheral blood or cord blood can repopulate a patient’s blood system. There are multiple potential opportunities for treating patients using engineered HSCs, including treating three common classes of blood-related disorders, such as hemoglobin disorders, including sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia; primary immune deficiencies, such as X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency; and bone marrow failures, such as Fanconi anemia. There are limited treatment options available for these types of blood disorders, and available options typically require chronic blood transfusions or bone marrow transplants. These procedures are associated with significant risk, including mortality. We believe the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be used to potentially provide curative benefits by correcting the underlying genetic defect in blood cells of patients with these disorders. In additional applications, normal HSCs may be engineered ex vivo using CRISPR/Cas9 to express a therapeutic protein, which is then administered to patients in need of that protein. 
 Challenges of developing stem cell products can include the relatively low quantity of available cells for treatment and a limited ability to expand HSCs ex vivo. We expect to counter these challenges, if necessary, by employing a proprietary small molecule for HSC expansion to which Novartis has granted us rights. This small molecule could allow us to generate larger numbers of HSCs for re-implantation in patients after editing. We expect that the application of this technology will improve the performance of the blood cell graft and improve patient outcomes and recovery times as more therapeutic cells can be administered. 
 We are pursuing a number of potential gene targets and therapeutic indications in collaboration with Novartis. Under our collaboration with Novartis, we and Novartis each have the right to designate a fixed number of HSC therapeutic targets during multiple selection windows, with Novartis having the right of first target selections. Our selection criteria for development programs include, among others, disease severity, existing treatment options, delivery efficiency, the nature of the genetic edit required and the expected performance of cells modified by the procedure. 
 OSC Program
 In 2018 we announced an expansion of our existing cell therapy collaboration with Novartis to include the ex vivo development of innovative cell therapies using certain OSCs. As part of the updated collaboration terms, Novartis will have the right to develop CRISPR/Cas9-based products for one or more targets using these stem cells. We received a one-time $10 million cash payment and, consistent with the original collaboration agreement, we are also eligible to receive downstream success-based milestones and royalties. We retained rights to all other in vivo and ex vivo applications of CRISPR/Cas9, including for eye disorders, subject to certain in vivo target selection options by Novartis set forth in the original agreement.
 Collaborations 
 To accelerate the development and commercialization of CRISPR/Cas9-based products in multiple therapeutic areas, we have formed, and intend to seek other opportunities to form, strategic alliances with collaborators who can augment our leadership in CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutic development. 
Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc. (“Novartis”)
 In December 2014, we entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with Novartis (the “Novartis Agreement”), primarily focused on the development of new ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9-edited therapies using CAR-T cells and HSCs. 
 Agreement Structure. The parties agreed to engage in collaborative research activities using our CRISPR/Cas9 platform to identify and research therapeutic, prophylactic and palliative products and services relating to the following applications:  a) ex vivo HSCs and b) ex vivo CAR-Ts.  In addition, in the last two years of the collaboration term, Novartis may engage in research and development of a limited number of in vivo targets using our platform.
 16


Scope of Collaboration. During the five-year collaboration term parties may research potential therapeutic, prophylactic and palliative ex vivo applications of CRISPR/Cas9 technology in HSCs and CAR-T cells. Research expenses incurred by us in support of the collaboration are reimbursed by Novartis.
 HSC Program. We and Novartis agreed to conduct research of HSC targets under a research plan agreed upon by both parties. Within the HSC therapeutic space, Novartis may obtain exclusive rights to a limited number of these HSC targets, to be selected by Novartis in a series of selection windows. We have the right to choose a limited number of HSC targets for our exclusive development and commercialization per the specified selection schedule. Following these selections by Novartis and us, Novartis may obtain rights to research an additional limited number of HSC targets on a non-exclusive basis. Novartis is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop and commercialize at least one HSC product directed to each of their selected HSC targets. 
 CAR-T Program. We have also agreed to collaborate with Novartis on research activities for CAR-T cell targets. After completion of the activities contemplated by the parties’ CAR-T cell program research plan, Novartis will assume sole responsibility for developing any products that it selects, arising from that research plan and the costs and expenses of developing, manufacturing and commercializing its selected research targets. Novartis is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop or commercialize at least one CAR-T cell product directed to each of its selected CAR-T cell targets. 
 In Vivo Program. During the last two years of the five-year collaboration term, Novartis has the option to select a limited number of targets for research, development and commercialization of in vivo therapies using our CRISPR/Cas9 platform, on a non-exclusive basis. Following Novartis’ selection of each in vivo target, Novartis may offer us the right to participate in the research and development of such targets, in which case an in vivo program research plan for such target will be entered into between us and Novartis. Novartis is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop or commercialize at least one in vivo product directed to each of its selected targets. Novartis’ in vivo target selections are subject to certain restrictions, including that the targets, or all targets within a limited number of organs: (i) have not already been reserved by us pursuant to our limited right to do so under the agreement; (ii) are not the subject of a collaboration or pending collaboration with a third party; and (iii) are not the subject of ongoing or planned research and development by us. 
 Governance. The parties formed HSC and CAR-T steering committees with responsibility for oversight of these respective research programs and approval of the associated research plans. The HSC steering committee is also responsible for the OSC program. These steering committees in turn are overseen by a joint steering committee. The above steering committees are comprised by an equal number of representatives from each party.
 Financial Terms. We received an upfront technology access payment from Novartis of $10.0 million in January 2015 and are entitled to additional technology access fees of $20.0 million and quarterly research payments of $1.0 million, or up to $20.0 million in the aggregate, during the five-year research term. To date, we have received $15.0 million in technology access fees and $15.0 million in research payments related to these programs. In addition, for each Novartis product under the collaboration (whether HSC or CAR-T, and as of December 2018, OSC), subject to certain conditions, we may  be eligible to receive (i) up to $30.3 million in development milestones, including for the filing of an IND application and for the dosing of the first patient in each of Phase IIa, Phase IIb and Phase III clinical trials, (ii) up to $50.0 million in regulatory milestones for the product’s first indication, including regulatory approvals in the U.S. and EU, (iii) up to $50.0 million in regulatory milestones for the product’s second indication, if any, including U.S. and EU regulatory approvals, (iv) royalties on net sales in the mid-single digits, and (v) net sales milestone payments of up to $100.0 million. We are also eligible to receive payments for: (i) each additional HSC target selected by Novartis beyond its initial defined allocation, for which we will receive $1.0 million for each target (ii) each in vivo target that Novartis selects as described above, and (iii) any exercise by Novartis of certain license options under the agreement. 
 Upon completion of the research collaboration term in December 2019, Novartis has the option to internalize the Intellia platform for a $50.0 million fee, which will allow them to select a limited number of additional CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing targets over five years. Up to $20.0 million of the internalization fee will be credited towards any milestone payments for any additional post-internalization targets (up to $4.0 million per target).
 17


Equity Investments. Additionally, at the inception of the arrangement at which time Intellia was a privately-held company, Novartis invested $9.0 million to purchase our Class A-1 and Class A-2 Preferred Units. The difference between the cash proceeds received from Novartis for the units and the $11.6 million estimated fair value of those units at the date of issuance was determined to be $2.6 million. Accordingly, $2.6 million of the upfront technology access payment was allocated to record the preferred units purchased by Novartis at fair value. 
 License Grant to Novartis. In the 2014 Novartis Agreement, we granted to Novartis a license to our CRISPR/Cas9 platform technology, including a sublicense to certain platform rights licensed from Caribou Biosciences, Inc. (“Caribou”), that is exclusive in the HSC, CAR-T cell and in vivo fields with respect to each target selected by Novartis pursuant to the agreement and the research plan as long as Novartis continues to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop, and commercialize CRISPR-edited products directed to such targets. Upon the expiration of the collaboration term, Novartis shall have the option to access and obtain a non-exclusive license to our CRISPR/Cas9 platform technology to research, develop and commercialize potential therapeutic, prophylactic and palliative products and services for a limited number of certain approved targets selected by Novartis, exercisable upon written notice to us within 30 days after the expiration of the collaboration term. Such approved targets are subject to certain restrictions, including that the targets may not have been already reserved by us pursuant to our limited right to do so under the agreement, may not be the subject of an existing out license of our CRISPR/Cas9 platform to a third party and may not be the subject of ongoing or planned research and development by us. This non-exclusive license will have a term of five years commencing upon the completion of the technology transfer by us enabling Novartis to practice such licensed rights, and Novartis may not select more than a specified number of approved targets in each year of this license term.
License Grant to Intellia. Novartis granted us a non-exclusive license to its intellectual property covering small molecule for HSC expansion and to its LNP platform technology to research, develop and commercialize HSC and in vivo genome editing products, respectively, in the 2014 Novartis Agreement.
 Intellectual Property. IP that we develop within the collaboration related to our CRISPR/Cas9 platform will be owned solely by us, while all other IP developed within the collaboration, including IP covering products arising from the collaboration, will be jointly owned by us and Novartis. 
 2018 Amendment to the Agreement. In December 2018, we entered into an amendment to this agreement with Novartis (the “Amendment”) which expands the scope of the Novartis Agreement to include the ex vivo development of CRISPR/Cas9-based cell therapies using limbal stem cells, a type of ocular stem cell, primarily against gene targets selected by Novartis in exchange for a one-time payment of $10.0 million which we received in December 2018. The governance, milestones and royalties associated with any limbal stem cell program will follow those for the HSC programs. As part of the amendment, Intellia rights to Novartis’ lipid nanoparticle (“LNP”) technology were expanded to include use on all genome editing applications in both in vivo and ex vivo settings.
 Term and Termination. The collaboration term ends in December 2019. The term of the agreement expires on the later of (i) the expiration of Novartis’ payment obligations under the agreement and (ii) the date of expiration of the last-to-expire of the patent rights licensed to us or Novartis under the agreement. Novartis’ royalty payment obligations expire on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of the royalty-bearing patents covering such product in such country or (ii) 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country. We may terminate the agreement if Novartis or its affiliates institute a patent challenge against our IP rights, and all improvements thereto, licensed to Novartis under the agreement. Novartis may terminate the agreement, without cause, upon 90 days’ written notice to us subject to certain conditions, including its payment of any accrued and future obligations as if the collaboration had continued through December 2019. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy—or insolvency-related events. 
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 In April 2016, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Regeneron (the “Regeneron Agreement”). 
 18


Agreement Structure. The Regeneron Agreement has two principal components: i) a product development component under which the parties will research, develop and commercialize CRISPR/Cas-based therapeutic products primarily focused on genome editing in the liver, and ii) a technology collaboration component, pursuant to which we and Regeneron will engage in research and development activities aimed at discovering and developing novel technologies and improvements to CRISPR/Cas technology to enhance our genome editing platform. Under this agreement, we also may access the Regeneron Genetics Center and proprietary mouse models to be provided by Regeneron for a limited number of our liver programs.
 Scope of Collaboration. Under the terms of the six-year collaboration, Regeneron may obtain exclusive rights for up to 10 targets to be chosen by Regeneron during the collaboration term subject to a target selection process and various adjustments and limitations set forth in the agreement. Of these 10 total targets, Regeneron may select up to five non-liver targets, while the remaining targets must be focused in the liver. Certain non-liver targets from Intellia's ongoing and planned research at the time, as well as any targets included in another Intellia collaboration, are excluded from this collaboration. At the inception of the agreement, Regeneron selected the first of its 10 targets, ATTR, which is subject to a Co-Development and Co-Promotion Agreement (“Co/Co”) between us and Regeneron, the general terms and conditions for which were outlined within the Regeneron Agreement.
 Research Collaboration. Research activities under the collaboration will be governed by evaluation and research and development plans that will outline the parties’ responsibilities under, anticipated timelines of and budgets for, the various programs. We will assist Regeneron with the preliminary evaluation of its selected liver targets, and Regeneron will be responsible for preclinical research and conducting clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization of products directed to each of its exclusive targets. We may assist, as requested by Regeneron, with the later discovery and research of product candidates directed to any selected target. For each selected target, Regeneron is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to submit regulatory filings necessary to achieve IND acceptance for at least one product directed to each applicable target, and following IND acceptance for at least one product, to develop and commercialize such product. 
 Reserved Liver Targets. We retain the exclusive right to solely develop products via CRISPR genome editing directed against certain specified genetic targets. During the collaboration term and subject to a target selection process, we have the right to choose additional liver targets for our own development using commercially reasonable efforts. Certain targets that either we or Regeneron select during the term may be subject to further co-development and co-commercialization arrangements at our or Regeneron’s option, as applicable, which either can exercise pursuant to defined conditions. 
 Governance. The parties formed a joint steering committee (“JSC”), which is responsible for setting research objectives and overseeing the general strategies and activities undertaken by the parties under the Regeneron Agreement.  Additionally, the parties formed a Joint Development and Commercialization Committee (“JDCC”) to oversee all profit share products under the Co/Co discussed below.  The JDCC will have responsibility for overseeing the development, manufacture, regulatory matters, and commercialization (including pricing and reimbursement) of ATTR, as the first profit share product under the collaboration agreement.
 Financial Terms. We received a nonrefundable upfront payment of $75.0 million. In addition, on Regeneron programs that are not subject to co-development and co-promotion agreements we may be eligible to earn, on a per-licensed target basis, (i) up to $25.0 million in development milestones, including for the dosing of the first patient in each of Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials, (ii) up to $110.0 million in regulatory milestones, including for the acceptance of a regulatory filing in the U.S., and for obtaining regulatory approval in the U.S. and in certain other identified countries, and (iii) up to $185.0 million in sales-based milestone payments. We are also eligible to earn royalties ranging from the high single digits to low teens, in each case, on a per-product basis, which royalties are potentially subject to various reductions and offsets and incorporate our existing low- to mid-single-digit royalty obligations under a license agreement with Caribou. 
 Equity Investments. In connection with this collaboration, Regeneron purchased $50.0 million of our common stock in a private placement under a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) concurrent with our initial public offering.
 19


Term and Termination. The collaboration term ends in April 2022, except that Regeneron may make a one-time payment of $25.0 million to extend the term for an additional two-year period. The agreement will continue until the date when no royalty or other payment obligations are due, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Regeneron’s royalty payment obligations expire on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of the royalty-bearing patents covering such product in such country, (ii) 12 years from the first commercial sale of such product in such country, or (iii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such product. We may terminate the agreement on a target-by-target basis if Regeneron or any of its affiliates institutes a patent challenge against our CRISPR/Cas or certain other background patent rights. We may also terminate the agreement on a target-by-target basis if Regeneron does not proceed with the development of a product directed to a selected target within specified periods of time. Regeneron may terminate the agreement, without cause, upon 180 days written notice to us, either in its entirety or on a target-by-target basis, in which event, certain rights in the terminated targets and associated IP revert to us, as described in the agreement. Following such termination, we may owe Regeneron royalties, in certain circumstances, up to mid-single digits on any terminated targets that we subsequently commercialize on a product-by-product basis for a period of 12 years after the first commercial sale of any such products. Either party may terminate the agreement either in its entirety or with respect to the technology collaboration or one or more of the targets selected by Regeneron, in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. 
 
Co-Development and Co-Promotion Agreement.
 In July 2018, we and Regeneron finalized the form of the Co/Co that will be used as the basis for each Co/Co agreement directed to a target. Simultaneously, we and Regeneron executed the Co/Co agreement directed to the first collaboration target, ATTR, for which we are the clinical and commercial Lead Party (see below). As such, Regeneron will be the Participating Party (see below), and will share equally in worldwide development costs and profits as long as it funds half of the defined research and development costs attributable to the ATTR program. 
 
Co-Development and Co-Promotion: Agreement Structure. Under the Co/Co Agreement, Regeneron has the right to exercise up to at least five Co/Co options on our liver targets (other than Intellia’s reserved liver targets), while we may exercise at least one Co/Co option on Regeneron’s liver targets, the exact number of Co/Co options being subject to certain conditions of the target selection process. Co/Co options must be exercised (or forfeited) once a target reaches a defined preclinical stage. Within 15 days of exercising the option, the party exercising the option must pay $1.5 million to the other party as compensation for prior work. The ATTR program was exempted from this payment. One Party will be the “Lead Party” and the other Party the “Participating Party”. The Lead Party shall have control and primary responsibility for the development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercial activities. The Participating Party shall have the right to consult on these activities through its participation on the JDCC and will have the right to co-fund development and commercialization activities in exchange for a share of profits. In general, the parties will share equally in worldwide development costs and profits of any future products.  Prior to reaching a specific development milestone, the Participating Party may elect to reduce its share of worldwide development costs and profits by 50 percent.
 Co-Development and Co-Promotion: Termination. Either party may terminate by providing 180 days written notice. If Intellia terminates, the product becomes a Regeneron product, and is subject to all future milestone and royalty payment obligations under the Regeneron Agreement. If Regeneron terminates and has contributed at least $5 million in Development Costs, Intellia will pay low- to mid-single digit royalties on the net sales of the product, depending on co-funding percentage, stage at termination and, if any, Regeneron IP incorporated into the product.
 Potential Future Collaborations 
 We view strategic partnerships as important drivers for helping accelerate our goal of rapidly treating patients. The potential application of CRISPR/Cas9 is extremely broad, and we plan to continue to identify partners who can contribute meaningful resources and insights to our programs and allow us to more rapidly bring scientific innovation to a broader patient population. 
 20


Intellectual Property
 We believe we are well positioned in terms of our IP because we: 
  
• | have built, and intend to expand, a broad worldwide portfolio of IP, including patents and patent applications, in areas relevant to the development and commercialization of human therapeutic products using CRISPR/Cas9 technology;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | protect our IP by maintaining trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology innovations and know-how; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | intend to take additional steps, where appropriate, to further protect our IP rights, including, for example, through the use of copyright protection and regulatory protection available via orphan drug designations, data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our licensed patent portfolio encompasses foundational filings on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 systems for gene editing, improvement modifications of these CRISPR systems, LNP technologies, TCRs for specific targets, and cell expansion technology relevant to stem cell-based therapies. We access these patent estates from licensors including Caribou, Novartis and OSR. We also actively apply for, maintain, and plan to defend and enforce, as needed, our internally developed and externally licensed patent rights. Furthermore, we continue to search for and evaluate opportunities to in-license IP relevant to our targeted therapeutic programs and platforms and to develop and acquire new IP in collaboration with third parties. 
 In addition to our in-licensed IP, our IP portfolio includes over 25 patent families filed since 2015 covering solely or jointly owned technologies that we have developed independently or through our collaborations with Novartis, Regeneron and OSR. The patent families claim inventions relating to CRISPR/Cas9 improvements, methods for delivering CRISPR/Cas9 components, methods of treating diseases using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and methods for analyzing editing events, among others.  Patents resulting from our internal portfolio, if issued, would expire no earlier than 2036.
 We actively apply for, maintain, and plan to defend and enforce, as needed, our internally developed and externally licensed patent rights. Furthermore, we continue to search for and evaluate opportunities to in-license IP relevant to our targeted therapeutic programs and platforms and to develop and acquire new IP in collaboration with third parties. 
 Caribou Biosciences In-Licensed Intellectual Property
 In July 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Caribou, as subsequently amended and supplemented, for an exclusive, worldwide license for human therapeutic, prophylactic, and palliative uses, except for anti-fungal and anti-microbial uses, defined in the license agreement as our field of use, of any CRISPR/Cas9-related patents and applications owned, controlled or licensed by Caribou as well as companion diagnostics to our product or product candidates. The license agreement also included exclusive rights in our field of use to any CRISPR/Cas9-related IP developed by Caribou after July 16, 2014 and through a cut-off date of January 30, 2018. The agreement further includes a non-exclusive research license to conduct research and development on product candidates and products. The Caribou licensed patent portfolio includes several U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications owned by Caribou, and U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications co-owned by The Regents of the University of California, the University of Vienna and Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier, as well as U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications owned or controlled by Pioneer Hi-Bred and its affiliates. We have the right to grant sublicenses to the Caribou licensed patent portfolio to third parties in our field of use. Caribou retains the right to practice the licensed IP in all other fields, including for its own specific therapeutics purposes, provided it does not pertain to the application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to the development of products in our field of use.
 Pursuant to a services agreement entered into with Caribou in parallel with the license agreement, we also received two years of research and development services from Caribou, which ended in November 2016. Any IP developed under the services agreement is owned by Caribou and is included in, and subject to the terms of, our license agreement with Caribou. 
 21


In relation to our founding, we issued Caribou 8,110,599 shares of our junior preferred stock. We paid Caribou $5.0 million over the term of the two-year services agreement; and have agreed to pay 30.0 percent of Caribou’s patent prosecution, filing, and maintenance costs for the IP included in the license agreement amounting to a total of $3.5 million paid through December 31, 2018. We also granted Caribou an exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, to any CRISPR/Cas9 patents, patent applications and know-how in Caribou’s retained fields of use owned or developed by us between July 16, 2014 and a cut-off date of January 30, 2018. Caribou, which is obligated to pay a portion of our patent filing, prosecution and maintenance costs for any such licensed IP, also has an option to sublicense any CRISPR/Cas9 IP in-licensed by us for uses and activities in its retained field of use. 
 The Caribou license agreement grants us sublicenses in our field of use to IP in-licensed by Caribou from The Regents of the University of California and the University of Vienna. Further, under the license agreement, we had an option to sublicense for our field of use any new IP in-licensed by Caribou through January 30, 2018. In July 2015, we exercised our option to sublicense a portfolio in-licensed by Caribou from Pioneer Hi-Bred International, according to the terms described below. 
 The term of the Caribou license is until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent right that is licensed to either party. We must use commercially reasonable and diligent efforts to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize at least one product. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach, bankruptcy or insolvency-related events, or breach of its obligations with respect to the included in-licenses. The license agreement with Caribou also gives us access, in our field of use, to Caribou internally developed IP. Since March 2013, Caribou has filed over 50 patent applications in the U.S. and internationally, which relate to the CRISPR/Cas platform, including modified and improved CRISPR/Cas9 systems or components, and methods of use that are part of our license. We cannot ensure that these applications will lead to issued claims that cover our products or activities. Any patents that grant from these applications will expire in or after 2034, assuming payment of necessary maintenance fees.
 On October 17, 2018, we initiated an arbitration proceeding against Caribou asserting that Caribou is violating the terms and conditions of the license agreement entered into by the Company and Caribou in July 2014 (“Caribou License”), as well as other contractual and legal rights, by using and seeking to license to third parties two patent families relating to specific structural or chemical modifications of gRNAs, that were purportedly invented or controlled by Caribou, in our exclusive human therapeutic field. Under the Caribou License, Caribou granted to the Company a worldwide, exclusive license to all of Caribou’s IP relating to CRISPR/Cas9 technology for all therapeutic, prophylactic and palliative uses and applications for any or all diseases and conditions in humans, with the sole exceptions of anti-microbial and/or anti-fungal applications. The license encompassed all CRISPR/Cas9 IP developed or controlled by Caribou as of July 16, 2014 and through an IP cutoff date (January 30, 2018) that was necessary or useful for us to develop, manufacture or commercialize products in our field, as well as any technology developed by Caribou under a service agreement entered into by the Company and Caribou in July 2014. Caribou has asserted that the two families of IP are outside the scope of our license. In accordance with the Caribou License, we have submitted a demand for arbitration seeking a declaration that the disputed IP is included within the scope of our license under the Caribou License, an award of compensatory, consequential and punitive damages based on Caribou’s conduct, and an injunction prohibiting Caribou from licensing or using this IP in our exclusive human therapeutics field, among other claims.
 The Regents of the University of California and the University of Vienna Intellectual Property 
 The Regents of the University of California and the University of Vienna (collectively, “UC/Vienna”) co-own with Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier a worldwide patent portfolio, which covers methods of use and compositions relating to engineered CRISPR/Cas9 systems for, among other things, cleaving or editing DNA and altering gene product expression in various organisms, including humans. We refer to this co-owned worldwide patent portfolio as the UC/Vienna/Charpentier patent family. The earliest claimed priority date for this patent family is May 25, 2012. As of December 31, 2018, this family includes granted patents in many jurisdictions outside the United States, including for example the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, China and the approximately 40 countries that are members of the European Patent Convention. Corresponding applications are being prosecuted in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) and other patent agencies across the world. Any patents that ultimately issue from this family and are appropriately maintained will expire in or after 2033.

Caribou entered into an exclusive, worldwide license in all fields, with the right to sublicense, for this patent family with UC/Vienna in April 2013 solely under UC/Vienna ownership rights. Caribou’s license remains in effect for the life of the last-to-expire patent or last-to-be-abandoned patent application licensed, whichever is later. Through our license agreement with Caribou, we have an exclusive sublicense to UC/Vienna’s interest in this foundational CRISPR/Cas9 patent family for use in human therapeutics, except for anti-fungal and anti-microbial uses as defined in the license agreement as our field of use. For products covered by this license and their companion diagnostics, we will owe mid-single-digit royalties on net sales. In addition, we may be subject to milestone payments of $0.1 million upon the first filing of an IND application, a total of $0.5 million for Phase II and Phase III clinical trials, $0.5 million to $1.0 million for each of the first three approved new drug applications or biologics license applications in the United States, and $0.2 million for each of the first three approved indications in Europe. Caribou has the right to terminate its agreement with UC/Vienna at any time or the agreement may be terminated due to an uncured material breach. We cannot guarantee that Caribou will maintain the UC/Vienna license for its full term. Should the license between Caribou and UC/Vienna be terminated for any reason, any compliant Caribou sublicenses as of the termination date will remain in effect and will be assigned to UC/Vienna in place of Caribou. Specifically, if we are in compliance with our obligations under our sublicense and Caribou and UC/Vienna terminate their agreement, UC/Vienna would replace Caribou as our licensor. 
 On April 13, 2015, UC/Vienna/Charpentier jointly filed a request with the USPTO asking that an interference be declared between a UC/Vienna/Charpentier patent application and certain patents issued to the Broad Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the President and Fellows of Harvard College (collectively, the “Broad Institute patent family” or the “Broad”), which claim aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 systems and methods to edit genes in eukaryotic cells, including human cells. An interference is an adversarial proceeding conducted by the USPTO’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board (the “PTAB”) to determine the initial inventor of a particular invention claimed in U.S. patents and patent applications owned by different parties. On January 11, 2016, the PTAB declared an interference involving one UC/Vienna/Charpentier application, 12 Broad issued patents and a Broad patent application.  In the order declaring the interference, the PTAB designated UC/Vienna/Charpentier the “Senior Party” and the Broad the “Junior Party”.  In March 2016, the PTAB re-declared the interference to add an additional U.S. patent application owned by the Broad.  On February 15, 2017, the PTAB dismissed the proceeding finding that the parties’ respective patent claims involved in the interference were distinct such that they did not meet the legal requirement to proceed with the interference. Specifically, the PTAB concluded that the Broad’s claims were directed to the use of CRISPR/Cas9 only in eukaryotic cells and, thus were patently distinct from UC/Vienna/Charpentier’s claims, which were directed to the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in all settings.  As a result of this proceeding’s dismissal, the PTAB did not make a decision regarding which party actually first invented the use of CRISPR/Cas9 systems and methods to edit genes in eukaryotic cells. In April 2017, UC/Vienna/Charpentier appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“the Federal Circuit”) seeking a review and reversal of the PTAB’s decision. On September 10, 2018, the Federal Circuit affirmed the PTAB’s decision to terminate the interference proceeding. The time for UC/Vienna/Charpentier to ask for a rehearing by the Federal Circuit or permission from the U.S. Supreme Court to appeal has expired. Accordingly, the Federal Circuit returned the UC/Vienna/Charpentier patent application at issue in the terminated interference to the USPTO.  On February 8, 2019, the USPTO issued a notice allowing the patent application, which, when issued, will cover generally the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology using a single RNA guide in any setting, including cellular settings.
 Pioneer Hi-Bred International (DuPont Company) Intellectual Property 
 Pioneer Hi-Bred and its affiliates, including the DuPont Company, have licensed to Caribou on a worldwide basis, various patent families relating to CRISPR/Cas systems, components and methods of use generally and CRISPR/Cas9 specifically in certain fields, which include Intellia’s field of use under our license agreement with Caribou. In July 2015, we exercised our option under the license agreement with Caribou to sublicense these Pioneer patent families in our field of use. The license from Pioneer to Caribou will expire upon the expiration, abandonment or invalidation of the last patent or patent application licensed from Pioneer to Caribou. 
 The licensed Pioneer portfolio includes a family of applications filed by Vilnius University that discloses the components of a CRISPR/Cas9 system required for gene editing in non-bacterial organisms. On May 2, 2017, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent No. 9,637,739, with claims covering the in vitro assembly and use of a recombinant CRISPR/Cas9 complex to modify DNA. Patents obtained from this patent family will expire in or after 2033, assuming payment of necessary maintenance fees. We cannot ensure that these additional applications in this family will lead to issued claims that cover our products or activities. 
 23


Invention Management Agreement 
 On December 15, 2016, we entered into a Consent to Assignments, Licensing and Common Ownership and Invention Management Agreement (the “Invention Management Agreement”), with The Regents of the University of California, University of Vienna, Dr. Charpentier, Caribou, CRISPR Therapeutics AG, ERS Genomics Ltd. and TRACR Hematology Ltd. Under the Invention Management Agreement, Dr. Charpentier retroactively consented to UC/Vienna’s CRISPR/Cas9 license to Caribou as well as Caribou’s sublicensing to Intellia certain of its rights to the UC/Vienna/Charpentier CRISPR/Cas9 IP, subject to the restrictions of our license from Caribou. Under the agreement, the parties commit to maintain and coordinate the prosecution, defense and enforcement of the CRISPR/Cas9 foundational patent portfolio worldwide, and each of the co-owners of the IP grants cross-consents to all existing and future licenses and sublicenses based on the rights of another co-owner. The Invention Management Agreement also includes retroactive approval by certain parties of certain prior assignments of interests in patent rights to other parties, and provides for, among other things, (i) good faith cooperation among the parties regarding patent maintenance, defense and prosecution, (ii) cost-sharing arrangements, and (iii) notice of and coordination in the event of third-party infringement of the subject patents. Unless earlier terminated by the parties, the Invention Management Agreement will continue in effect until the later of the last expiration date of the UC/Vienna/Charpentier patents underlying the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, or the date on which the last underlying patent application is abandoned. 
Novartis In-Licensed Intellectual Property
 The December 2014 Novartis Agreement grants us worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free rights to a portfolio of 14 Novartis patent families containing granted patents and pending applications in the United States and internationally relating to LNP compositions, methods of use and modified nucleic acids. The license under the Novartis Agreement permits us to use the Novartis LNPs to develop therapeutic, prophylactic, and palliative CRISPR-based in vivo products. Under a December 2018 amendment to the Novartis Agreement, we obtained rights to use these LNPs both in vivo and ex vivo for any gene editing product.   The earliest claimed priority dates for the licensed patent families range from December 2009 through June 2013, and accordingly will expire by or after December 2030. The term of the license continues until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent right that is licensed to either party. If we attempt to challenge any of the patents in the licensed families, Novartis may terminate the license on a patent-by-patent basis. We cannot guarantee that our products or delivery methods will be covered by issued claims in these families. 
 In addition, under the Novartis Agreement, Novartis has also granted us rights to use its proprietary small molecule for HSC expansion. Our rights to this technology are subject to a single-digit royalty based on whether we develop and commercialize the relevant product solely or in collaboration with another third party. 
 Under the Novartis Agreement, any platform IP developed as part of the collaboration is owned solely by us, while all other IP developed within the collaboration, including product-based IP, is jointly owned by us and Novartis. We cannot guarantee that IP filed based on collaboration data will result in issued claims covering our products or delivery methods. Under our agreement with Novartis, we have also granted Novartis a sublicense to the IP we license under our agreement with Caribou for the Novartis-selected HSC and CAR-T cells products, and in vivo products if applicable, with such sublicense being exclusive as long as Novartis uses commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize those products. 
 In December 2018, we entered into an amendment to our agreement with Novartis which expands the scope of the Novartis Agreement to include the ex vivo development of CRISPR/Cas9-based cell therapies using limbal stem cells primarily against selected gene targets by Novartis.
 Manufacturing
 We have entered into certain manufacturing and supply arrangements with third-party suppliers to support production of our product candidates and their components. We plan to continue to rely on these qualified third-party organizations to produce or process bulk compounds, formulated compounds, viral vectors or engineered cells for IND-supporting activities and early stage clinical trials. We expect that clinical and commercial quantities of any in vivo product or engineered cells that we may seek to develop will be manufactured in facilities and by processes 
 24


that comply with FDA and other regulations. At the appropriate time in the product development process, we will determine whether to establish manufacturing facilities or continue to rely on third parties to manufacture commercial quantities of any products that we may successfully develop. In certain instances, we may consider building our own commercial infrastructure. 
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are extremely competitive in the race to develop new products. While we believe we have significant competitive advantages with our industry-leading expertise in genome editing, clinical development expertise and dominant IP position, we currently face and will continue to face competition for our development programs from companies that use genome editing or gene therapy development platforms and from companies focused on more traditional therapeutic modalities such as small molecules and antibodies. The competition is likely to come from multiple sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many of these competitors may have access to greater capital and resources than us. For any products that we may ultimately commercialize, not only will we compete with any existing therapies and those therapies currently in development, but we will also have to compete with new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Competitors in our efforts to provide genetic therapies to patients can be grouped into at least three sets based on their product discovery platforms:
  
• | genome editing companies focused on CRISPR/Cas9 including: Beam Therapeutics Inc., Caribou Biosciences, Inc., Casebia Therapeutics, LLC, CRISPR Therapeutics, Inc., Editas Medicine, Inc., ToolGen, Inc., and Tracr Hematology Limited;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other genome editing companies including: bluebird bio, Inc., Cellectis S.A., Homology Medicines, Inc., Poseida, Inc., Precision BioSciences, Inc., and Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc., and;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | genome therapy companies developing in vivo or ex vivo therapies, such as cell therapies, including: bluebird bio, Inc., Cellectis S.A., Celgene Corporation (which acquired Juno Therapeutics, Inc.), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (which acquired Kite Pharma, Inc.), Novartis A.G., Spark Therapeutics, Inc., and Voyager Therapeutics, Inc.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our competitors will also include companies that are or will be developing other genome editing methods as well as small molecules, biologics, in vivo gene therapies, engineered cell therapies (both autologous and allogeneic) and nucleic acid-based therapies for the same indications that we are targeting with our CRISPR/Cas9-based therapeutics. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 We are subject to extensive regulation. We expect our future in vivo and ex vivo product candidates to be regulated as biologics. Biological products are subject to regulation under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic (“FD&C”) Act and the Public Health Service Act (“PHS Act”), and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving drug and biological products. Before clinical testing of biological products in the U.S. may begin, we must submit an IND to the FDA, which reviews the clinical protocol and other information, and the IND must become effective before clinical trials may begin. 
 Biologic products must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agencies before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals. 
 25


Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) regulates biological products, including gene and cell therapies. CBER’s Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies (“OTAT”) is responsible for oversight of gene therapy and related products, and the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee (“CTGTAC”) advises CBER on its reviews. Human gene therapy products are defined as all products that mediate their effects by transcription or translation of transferred genetic material or by specifically altering host (human) genetic sequences. Some examples of gene therapy products include nucleic acids, genetically modified microorganisms (e.g., viruses, bacteria, fungi), engineered site-specific nucleases used for human genome editing, and ex vivo genetically modified human cells. FDA has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general and their preclinical assessment, potency or other quality testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy INDs, and long-term adverse event monitoring of clinical trial subjects; all of which are intended to facilitate industry’s development of these products. More recently and as part of the implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act, FDA has issued a number of draft guidances pertaining to Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapies, which are defined as including cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products and combination products using any such therapies or products. Additionally, gene therapies, including genetically modified cells, that lead to a durable modification of cells or tissues may meet the definition of a regenerative medicine therapy. A number of guidances have been revised to reflect the growing knowledge and incorporation of newer technology, including certain considerations for genome editing. A small number of gene therapy products have been approved by regulatory agencies.  In 2012, the European Medicines Agency authorized the marketing of the first gene therapy product approved by regulatory authorities anywhere in the Western world.  And in the U.S., in 2017, the FDA approved the first two cell-based gene therapy products as well as a gene therapy product.
 Ethical, social and legal concerns about genome-editing technology, gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any product candidates. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 U.S. Gene and Cell Therapy Products Development Process 
 The FDA approves biologics, including gene and cellular therapy products, through the Biologics License Application (“BLA”) process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. This process generally involves the following: 

• | completion of extensive nonclinical, sometimes referred to as preclinical laboratory tests, and preclinical animal studies and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including good laboratory practice (“GLP”);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practice (“GCP”) and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity, and potency, from nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practice (“cGTP”) requirements for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 26


 
• | positive results from potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA licensure.
--+----------------------------------------------

 Before testing any drug or biological product candidate, including gene and cellular therapy product candidates, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. 
 The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to, among other reasons, safety concerns or non-compliance with regulatory requirements. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that result in the suspension or termination of such trials. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Certain clinical trials also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee (“IBC”), a local institutional committee that reviews all forms of research conducted at that institution involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment and ensures that all research is conducted in compliance with National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase I. The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase II. The product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase III. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency (for BLA products), and safety in an expanded patient population at dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval and labeling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 27


Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA typically advises that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for up to a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. 
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other trials, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics such as gene and cellular therapy products, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information to NIH. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made publicly available as part of the registration at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved, up to a maximum of two years. 
 Human therapeutic products based on gene-editing technology are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the study period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, purity and potency for BLA products that are human gene editing therapeutics, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP, and in certain cases, cGTP, requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final product to support a BLA. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product candidate (such as gene and cellular therapy products), FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal trials, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), a BLA or supplement to a BLA, for a product candidate with certain novel characteristics must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the claimed 
 28


indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (“FDASIA”) requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (“PSP”) within sixty days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include, among other things, an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including, to the extent practicable, study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information, along with any other information specified in FDA regulations. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, or other clinical development programs. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, including for failure to pay required fees, and may request additional information. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective (or, in the case of biological products, safe, pure and potent), and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP, and in certain cases, cGTP, requirements to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the FDA review and approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug or biological product candidate. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the application without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and, if applicable, cGTP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, cGTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control. 
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the application identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring clarifying labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring product reformulation or additional 
 29


clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the application, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, challenge the determination set forth in the letter by requesting a hearing or withdraw the application. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases, dosages or patient subgroups or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, precautions or adverse events be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA VI (Fiscal Years 2018-2022) is to review 90 percent of BLAs in 10 months from the 60-day filing date, and 90 percent of priority BLAs in six months from the 60-day filing date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change with PDUFA reauthorization. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission, also known as a Major Amendment, within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 The FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to biological products, including cellular and gene therapy products, intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. Orphan product designation must be requested before submission of BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 In the U.S., Orphan Drug Designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same orphan indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan designated product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity, which may permit off-label use for the orphan indication. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA for the same orphan indication or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 In the U.S. and the EU, as well as in other countries, there are a number of programs to expedite development, review and approval of products for serious or life-threatening disease or condition that address an unmet medical need in the relevant regulatory jurisdiction. In the U.S., these FDA programs include Fast Track Designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough designation. Similar programs in the EU include accelerated assessment, conditional approval and PRIME, which stands for priority medicines.
 30


The FDA’s Fast Track program intends to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new biologic, including gene and cellular therapy products, may request that the FDA designate the product as a Fast Track product at any time during the product’s clinical development, but ideally not later than the pre-BLA meeting. The FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application for a Fast Track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. 
 In the U.S., any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness of the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of that condition. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product subject to accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 In addition, under the provisions of the FDASIA, the FDA established a Breakthrough Therapy Designation, which is intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biological product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the features of Fast Track designation, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, but these can also be granted to the same product candidate if the relevant criteria are met. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. All requests for breakthrough therapy designation will be reviewed within 60 days of receipt, and FDA will either grant or deny the request. 
 Orphan designation, Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Where applicable, we plan to request Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designation for our product candidates. Even if we receive one or both of these designations for our product candidates, the FDA may later decide that our product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification. In addition, these designations may not provide us with a material commercial advantage. 
 Regenerative medicine advanced therapies (“RMAT”) designation
 As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, the FD&C Act was amended to facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of regenerative medicine advanced therapies, which include cell and gene therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products. This program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of regenerative medicine therapies, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and qualify for RMAT designation. A drug sponsor may request that FDA designate a drug as a RMAT concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. FDA has 60 calendar days to determine 
 31


whether the drug meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A BLA for a regenerative medicine therapy that has received RMAT designation may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through use of surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of RMAT designation also include early interactions with FDA and for those granted accelerated approval post-approval requirements may be fulfilled through the submission of clinical evidence from clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real-world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval.
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations and, as applicable, their counterparts in other jurisdictions, requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products, including gene and cellular therapy products, continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of certain components of products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control, quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products, including gene and cellular therapy products. 
 We also would have to comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet and social media platforms. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product, imposition of a REMS or post-market study requirement or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products, including gene and cellular therapy products, in the United States are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain other federal and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain other federal and state agencies for compliance with cGMP, and in certain cases, cGTP, requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market, as well as potential civil and criminal liability. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.

Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product in the United States. Starting in 2015, the FDA commenced licensing biosimilars under the BPCIA, and there are currently numerous biosimilars approved in the U.S. and Europe. The FDA has issued several draft and final guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars and interchangeable biological products. 
 The BPCIA also contains various provisions regarding exclusivity for reference and interchangeable products and procedures for sharing and litigating patents covering the reference product. The BPCIA, however, is complex and only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, proposed legislation has sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty. 
 Additional Regulation 
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, all affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. 
Other Healthcare Laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of biological products, other U.S. federal and state healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, which include, but are not limited to, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and physician payment transparency laws. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order, arrangement for or recommendation of the purchase, lease, order, arrangement for any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Affordable Care Act or ACA, provides that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the federal False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from the federal government, including Medicare, Medicaid and other government payors, that are false or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 33


 
• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose, among other things, requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the U.S. federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the “Physician Payments Sunshine Act,” created under the Affordable Care Act, and their implementing regulations, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians, other healthcare providers, and their immediate family members;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other laws which prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which prohibits, among other things, the commercialization of adulterated or misbranded of drugs and medical devices and the Public Health Service Act, which prohibits, among other things, the commercialization of biological products unless a biologics license is in effect; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and may be broader in scope than their federal equivalents; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Because of the breadth of these laws and the limited statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. 
 34


As of May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) regulates the collection and use of personal data in the EU. The GDPR covers any business, regardless of its location, that provides goods or services to residents in the EU and, thus, could incorporate our activities in EU member states. The GDPR imposes strict requirements on controllers and processors of personal data, including special protections for “sensitive information,” which includes health and genetic information of individuals residing in the EU. GDPR grants individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal information, allows them to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, and provides the individual with an express right to seek legal remedies in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated. Further, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to regions that have not been deemed to offer “adequate” privacy protections, such as the U.S. currently. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU member states, which may deviate slightly from the GDPR, may result in warning letters, mandatory audits and financial penalties, including fines of up to 4 percent of global revenues, or €20,000,000, whichever is greater. As a result of the implementation of the GDPR, we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
 To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
 Other Government Regulation 
 In addition to the healthcare laws and regulations in the U.S. and EU discussed above, we may be subject to a variety of regulations in these and other jurisdictions governing, among other things, animal research, clinical studies, manufacture, marketing approval, and any commercial sales and distribution of biological products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 
Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any biological product for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. 
 In the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for biological products, including gene and cellular therapy products, exists among third-party payors. As a result, obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for such a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data regarding the products’ clinical benefits and risks on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Even if we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate for us to achieve or sustain profitability or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, third-party payors may not cover, or provide adequate reimbursement for, long-term follow-up evaluations required following the use of our gene-modifying products. Patients are unlikely to use, and health care providers may not prescribe, our product candidates unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to 
 35


cover a significant portion of the product’s cost to the patient. Because our product candidates may have a higher cost of goods than conventional therapies, and may require long-term follow up evaluations, the risk that coverage and reimbursement rates may be inadequate for us to achieve profitability may be greater. Moreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors in the U.S. and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for biological products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. In addition, we expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates upon their approval due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, cost containment initiatives and additional legislative changes.  For these reasons, there is significant uncertainty related to coverage and reimbursement of our future products. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates.
 Third‑party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost‑containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost‑containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third‑party reimbursement for our products or a decision by a third‑party payor to not cover our products could reduce physician usage of the products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non‑governmental payors.
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress.
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.

Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare.
 For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted in the United States. The ACA includes measures that have significantly changed, and are expected to continue to significantly change, the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are that the ACA:
  
• | made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs to 23.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs to provide a 50% (70% as of January 1, 2019) point‑of‑sale discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D beneficiaries in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”) as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs being covered under Medicare Part D; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extended a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in significant civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established a new Patient‑Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient‑Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products. The ACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation through 2019.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Congress also could consider additional legislation to repeal, replace, or further modify elements of the ACA. Thus, the full impact of the ACA, or any law replacing elements of it, and the political uncertainty regarding any repeal and replacement on the ACA, on our business remains unclear. 
 37


Additionally, there have been a number of proposed regulatory actions and legislative recommendations aimed at lowering prescription drug prices, and in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019.  There have also been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries related to prescription drug prices.
 We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
