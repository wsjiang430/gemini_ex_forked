ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 CloudCommerce, Inc. (“CloudCommerce,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is a leading provider of data driven solutions. We develop solutions that help our clients acquire, engage, and retain their customers by leveraging cutting edge digital strategies and technologies. We focus intently on using data analytics to drive the creation of great user experiences and effective digital marketing campaigns. Whether it is creating omni-channel experiences, engaging a specific audience, or energizing voters in political campaigns, we believe data is the key to digital success. Our goal is to become the industry leader by always applying a “data first” strategy and acquiring other companies that can help us achieve this vision. 
 To better serve our customers and create value for our shareholders, we strategically acquire profitable cloud commerce solutions providers with strong management teams.
 Core Services
 Our core solutions are data analytics, digital marketing, branding and creative services, and development managed infrastructure support.
 Data Analytics
 To deliver the highest Return on Investment (“ROI”) for our customers’ digital marketing campaigns, we utilize sophisticated data science to identify the correct universes to target relevant audiences. Our ability to understand and translate data drives every decision we make. By listening to and analyzing our customers’ data we are able to make informed decisions that positively impact our customers’ business. We leverage industry-best tools to aggregate and visualize data across multiple sources, and then our data and behavioral scientists segment and model that data to be deployed in targeted marketing campaigns. We have data analytics expertise in retail, wholesale, distribution, logistics, manufacturing, political, and several other industries.
Digital Marketing
 We help our customers get their message out, educate their market and tell their story. We do so creatively and effectively by deploying powerful call-to-action digital campaigns with national reach and boosting exposure and validation with coordinated advertising in print media. Our fully-developed marketing plans are founded on sound research methodologies, brand audits and exploration of the competitive landscape. Whether our customer is a challenger brand, a political candidate, or a well-known household name, our strategists are skillful at leveraging data and creating campaigns that move people to make decisions.
Branding and Creative Services
 We approach branding from a “big picture” perspective, establishing a strong identity and then building on that to develop a comprehensive branding program that tells our customer’s story, articulates what sets our customer apart from their competitors and establishes our customer in their market.
Development and Managed Infrastructure Support
 Commerce-focused, user-friendly digital websites and apps elevates our customer’s marketing position and draw consumers to their products and services. Our platform-agnostic approach allows us to architect and build solutions that are the best fit for each customer. Once the digital properties are built, our experts will help manage and protect the website or app and provide the expertise needed to scale the infrastructure needed as our customer’s business grows.
Revenue Model
 We have a variety of revenue-generating models. We charge fixed or variable implementation fees to design, build and launch websites. In addition, we have several retainer arrangements for other services that vary in term length that provides reliable income. Our professional services are billed at hourly or monthly rates, depending on the customer’s needs. We believe this flexibility allows us to attract customers while maximizing profits based on billable hours.

Benefits to Clients
 Our complete solution of providing robust technology along with complementary professional services delivers many benefits to our customers.
 Reduced Total Cost of Ownership and Risk
 Utilizing our services, businesses can dramatically reduce or eliminate upfront and ongoing hardware, software, maintenance and support costs associated with developing, customizing, deploying and upgrading sophisticated solutions and campaigns. They can have a global digital presence without assuming the costs and risks of developing it themselves and take immediate advantage of the investments we continually make in our digital systems and associated services. Our commitment to the latest technologies helps ensure that our clients maintain pace with industry advances.
Revenue Growth
 We help our clients grow their businesses by leveraging our experience to (i) increase the acquisition, retention and lifetime value of new customers; (ii) extending their businesses into new geographic markets; and (iii) expanding the visibility and sales of their products through new online sales channels. We have developed substantial expertise in digital marketing which we apply to help our clients enhance their brands and increase interest and traffic, all of which are designed to generate higher revenues for our clients’ businesses and greater revenue for the Company.
Deployment Speed
 Businesses can reduce the time required to develop their digital presence by utilizing our outsourced business model. Typically, a new client can have their digital properties live much more quickly than if they decided to build, test and deploy resources in-house. Once they are operational, clients can make real-time changes to their digital properties, allowing them to address issues and take advantage of opportunities without technical assistance.
Focus on Core Competency
 By utilizing our outsourced-agency model, businesses can focus on developing, marketing and selling their products rather than devoting time and resources to building and maintaining an internal infrastructure. Management can focus their time on their core business while ensuring they have access to the latest technologies, tools and expertise for running a successful digital operation.
Sales and Marketing 
 Our objective is to be the leading global provider of data-driven solutions. To achieve this objective, we have assembled a team of experts working collectively for the best interest of our customers. 
 During the client sales process, our team delivers demonstrations, presentations, proposals and contracts. Many new customers have been retained through email marketing, direct sales, and word-of-mouth referrals. Our direct sales efforts are aimed at senior marketing and information technology (IT) executives within Consumer, B2B and political organizations who are looking to create or expand their digital operations. Word-of-mouth referrals have been very valuable to us and we intend to continue nurturing our customer and industry relationships to maximize these referrals.
 In addition to our direct sales efforts and referrals, we have established and continue to explore channel partnerships to expand our customer base. Prospective channel partners include existing Technology companies, hosting providers, ERP vendors, and e-commerce marketing professionals.
 Industry Overview
 Growth of Mobile, Digital and Social 
 We believe there are a number of factors that are contributing to the growth of mobile, digital and social commerce, including the following: (i) accessibility and adoption of smartphone devices throughout the world; (ii) rapid advancements in high-speed internet and 4G cellular networks making the internet more available, reliable, and efficient; (iii) consumers are more comfortable with the process of consuming information and buying products from their mobile devices; (iv) the functionality of both mobile and desktop website continues to improve, a greater range of mobile payment options are available, and special offers and shipping discounts are making online shopping more attractive; (v) businesses are placing more emphasis on their digital commerce strategies as mobile, desktop and social channels can reach a larger audience at a comparatively lower cost than the methods used to drive traffic to

traditional brick-and-mortar retail stores. As a result of these growth drivers, we believe retailers and wholesalers have begun to build large, global customer bases that can be reached cost-effectively, potentially resulting in higher sales and profitability.
 Opportunities for Outsourced Digital Solutions
 We believe there are advantages to outsourcing data analytics, digital marketing, creative and development solutions like those of CloudCommerce as an attractive alternative to building and maintaining this capability in-house. These advantages include: (i) eliminating the substantial up-front and ongoing costs of computer hardware, network infrastructure and specialized application software and personnel; (ii) reducing the time it takes to get digital products and properties live and productive; (iii) shifting the ongoing technology, financial, regulatory and compliance risks to a proven service provider; (iv) leveraging the expertise of a digital solutions provider to accelerate growth of a business; and (v) allowing businesses to focus on their specific core competencies.
Competition
 The market for digital marketing solutions providers is highly fragmented with vendors providing expertise in specific areas. Usually, merchants or brands must manage multiple vendors that supply specific services. We compete with other outsourced digital providers as well as with companies that maintain their own internal teams and build their solutions themselves. The competition we encounter includes:

● | In-house development of digital capabilities using tools or applications available for a fee or through open-source models;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Digital capabilities custom-developed by global solutions providers including, but not limited to, IBM Digital, Accenture Interactive, WPP, Omnicom, Publicis;

● | Web hosting, web services and infrastructure companies that offer portions of our solution and are seeking to expand the range of their offering, including, but not limited to, Network Solutions, LLC, Akamai Technologies, Inc., Yahoo! Inc., eBay Inc. and Hostopia.com Inc.
