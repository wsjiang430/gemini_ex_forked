Company Overview
Kennedy Wilson is a global real estate investment company.  We own, operate, and invest in real estate both on our own and through our investment management platform.  We focus primarily on multifamily and office properties located in the Western United States, United Kingdom, and Ireland. To complement our investment business, the Company also provides real estate services primarily to financial services clients. 
Our value is primarily derived from our ownership in income producing real estate assets as well as management's track record of producing attractive returns on its investments. We have an ownership interest in approximately 53 million square feet of property globally, including 28,613 multifamily rental units and 18.9 million square feet of commercial property. At December 31, 2018, we and our equity partners held portfolio with assets at a book value of approximately $11.3 billion.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, these assets generated total revenues of approximately $1.0 billion.  The Company has an average ownership interest across all of its investments of approximately 63% as of December 31, 2018. In addition to our income producing real estate, we engage in development, redevelopment and value add initiatives through which we enhance cash flows or reposition asset to increase value. 
We have 375 employees in 17 offices primarily located throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Spain. 
The following is our business model: 

• | Identify countries and markets with an attractive investment landscape


• | Establish operating platforms in our target markets


• | Develop local intelligence and create long-lasting relationships, primarily with financial institutions


• | Leverage relationships and local knowledge to drive proprietary investment opportunities with a focus on off-market transactions that we expect will result in above average cash flows and returns over the long term


• | Acquire high quality assets, either on our own or with strategic partners, utilizing cash from our balance sheet (funded by cash flows from operations, refinancing of current investments, investments sales or the sale of equity or debt securities) and typically financing them on a long-term basis


• | Reposition assets to enhance cash flows post-acquisition


• | Explore development opportunities on underutilized portions of assets, primarily excess land with little or no basis that is adjacent to income producing properties or acquire development assets that fit within our overall investment strategy


• | Continuously evaluate and selectively harvest asset and entity value through strategic realizations using both the public and private markets


• | Use our services businesses to meet client needs, strengthen relationships with financial institutions, and position ourselves as a valuable resource and partner to these institutions for any future real estate opportunities

Business Segments
Our operations are defined by two core business units: KW Investments and KW Investment Management and Real Estate Services (IMRES). 

• | KW Investments invests our capital in real estate-related assets using a mixture of wholly owned investments and investments made with equity partners.


• | IMRES encompasses our fee generating businesses, which includes our investment management platform and the property services platform. These businesses offer a comprehensive line of real estate services for the full lifecycle of real estate ownership to clients that include financial institutions, institutional investors, insurance companies, developers, builders and government agencies.

Our segments have a symbiotic relationship and work closely together. IMRES plays a critical role in supporting our investment strategy by providing local market intelligence and real-time data for evaluating investments, generating proprietary transaction flow and creating value through efficient implementation of asset management or repositioning strategies. KW Investments enables clients to benefit from the capabilities of IMRES. 
KW Investments
We invest our capital in real estate assets either on our own or through our investment management platform. When we have partners, we are typically the general partner in the arrangement generated management fees with a promoted interest in the profits of our investments beyond our ownership percentage. The Company has an average ownership interest across all its investments of approximately 63% as of December 31, 2018. Our equity partners include, financial institutions, foundations, 
 2

endowments, high net worth individuals and other institutional investors. We typically act as asset managers on our investments and generally will outsource the day to day property management to third parties.
The following are product types we invest in through the KW Investments segment: 
Multifamily
We pursue multifamily acquisition opportunities where we can unlock value through a myriad of strategies, including institutional management, asset rehabilitation, repositioning and creative recapitalization. We focus primarily on apartments in supply-constrained, infill markets. 
As of December 31, 2018, we hold investments in 28,613 multifamily apartment units across 108 assets primarily located in the Western United States, Ireland and United Kingdom. Based on our share of net operating income, 43% of our Western United States multifamily assets are located in the Pacific Northwest, primarily in suburbs of Seattle and Portland. The rest of the Western United States portfolio is in Northern and Southern California and the Mountain States region of Utah, Idaho and Nevada. 
Through our Vintage Housing Holdings ("VHH") partnership we acquire and develop income and age restricted properties.  The VHH portfolio includes over 6,900 rental units with approximately another 2,000 units currently under development or undergoing entitlements in the Western United States.  VHH typically utilizes tax-exempt bond financing and the sale of federal tax credits to help finance its investments.
Commercial
We pursue office acquisitions opportunities that typically have a value-add component that can benefit from our asset management expertise. After acquisition, the properties are generally repositioned to enhance market value. 
Our retail portfolio has different characteristics based on the geographic markets that the properties are located in. In Europe, we have a mixture of high street retail, suburban shopping centers and leisure assets which are mainly located in the United Kingdom as well as Dublin and Madrid. In our Western United States retail portfolio we invest in shopping centers that are generally grocery anchored. 
Our industrial portfolio is mainly distribution centers located in the United Kingdom.    
As of December 31, 2018, we hold investments in 198 commercial properties, totaling over 18.9 million square feet, predominately in the United Kingdom and Ireland with additional investments in Italy, Spain, the Pacific Northwest and Southern California. 
Hotel
We acquire hotels in certain opportunistic situations in which we are able to purchase at a discount to replacement cost or can implement our value-add investment approach. As of December 31, 2018, we have an ownership interest in 6 hotels (including one hotel under development) with 999 hotel rooms located in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Hawaii and Northern California.
Residential, Loan and Other
In certain cases, we may pursue for sale housing acquisition opportunities, including land for entitlements, finished lots, urban infill housing sites and partially finished and finished housing projects. On certain income-producing acquisitions, there are adjacent land parcels for which we may pursue entitlement activities or, in some cases, development or re-development opportunities. 
We acquire and/or originate loans secured by real estate. Our acquisitions and originations include individual notes on all real estate property types as well as portfolios of loans purchased from financial institutions, corporations and government agencies. We deliver value through loan resolutions, discounted payoffs, and sales. We also convert certain loans into a direct ownership in the underlying real estate collateral. 
Our loan investment portfolio is generally countercyclical to our other real estate investment businesses. When market conditions deteriorate there are more opportunities in acquiring loan portfolios. Our portfolio is principally related to loans acquired at a discount from their contractual balance due as a result of deteriorated credit quality of the borrower or market conditions. Such loans are underwritten by us based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral. Due to the discounted purchase price, we seek and are generally able to accomplish near term realization of the loan in a cash settlement or by obtaining title to the property. Accordingly, the credit quality of the borrower is not of substantial importance to our evaluation of the risk of recovery from the investment.
This group also includes our investment in liquid non-real estate investments which include marketable securities, investment funds that hold marketable securities and private equity investments. 
 3

As of December 31, 2018, we hold 20 investments which are primarily comprised of 340 residential units/lots and 4,004 acres located in Hawaii and the Western United States. As of December 31, 2018, these investments had a gross asset value of $274.7 million and the Company had a weighted average ownership in such of investments of 55%. These investments are in various stages of completion, ranging from securing the proper entitlements on land positions to sales of units/lots. Please also see the sections titled "Industry Overview - Western United States" and "Industry Overview - Hawaii".
Development and redevelopment
We have a number of development, redevelopment and entitlement projects that are underway or in the planning stages. Unlike the residential projects that are held for sale and described in the section directly above, these initiatives may ultimately result in income-producing assets (4,153 multifamily units and 0.9 million commercial rentable square feet), along with substantial upgrades to certain multifamily and commercial properties and hotels that are already producing income for the Company. If these projects are brought to completion, the Company’s estimated share of the total capitalization of these projects would be approximately $1.1 billion (approximately 30% of which has already been funded), which we expect would be funded through our existing equity, third party equity, project sales, tax credit financing and secured debt financing.  This represents total capital over the life of the projects and is not a representation of peak capital and does not take into account any distributions over the course of the investment. We and our equity partners are under no obligation to complete these projects and may dispose of any such assets after adding value through the entitlement process. Please also see the section titled “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Development and redevelopment” in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional detail on these investments. 
KW Investment Management and Real Estate Services (IMRES)
IMRES includes both our investment management platform and to a lesser extent our third-party services business and offers a comprehensive line of real estate services for the full lifecycle of real estate ownership to clients that include financial institutions, institutional investors, insurance companies, developers, builders and government agencies. IMRES has four main lines of business: investment management, property services, brokerage, and auction and conventional sales. These four business lines generate revenue for us through fees and commissions.
We manage approximately $16 billion of IMRES AUM, the majority of which we have an ownership interest in and the balance we manage for third parties (please see definition of IMRES AUM in the section titled "Non-GAAP Measures and Certain Definitions"). With 17 offices throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Jersey and Spain, we have the capabilities and resources to provide property services to real estate owners as well as the experience, as a real estate investor, to understand client concerns. The managers of IMRES have an extensive track record in their respective lines of business and in the real estate community as a whole. Their knowledge and relationships are an excellent driver of business through the services business as well as on the investment front.
Additionally, IMRES plays a critical role in supporting our investment strategy by providing local market intelligence and real-time data for evaluating investments, generating proprietary transaction flow and creating value through efficient implementation of asset management or repositioning strategies.
Investment Management 
Our investment management platform utilizes a number of different investment vehicles for which we provide acquisition, asset management, financing, and other investment-related services, and typically includes a co-investment from us. We usually provide investment management services on our consolidated investment portfolio as well as investments with strategic partners many of whom have separate account agreements with us. Through our fund management business we have two active closed end funds seeking to generate attractive, risk adjusted returns. 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company manages a total of $2.2 billion in fee-bearing capital.  
Commingled funds
We currently have two closed end funds that we manage and receive investment management fees. We focus on sourcing investors in the U.S., Europe and Middle East and investments in U.S and Europe with respect to our commingled funds. 
Separate accounts
We have a few equity partners that have separate account agreements with us. As part of the agreement we act as the general partner and receive investment management fees including potential acquisition, disposition, financing, construction management, performance and other fees. 
Property Services
This division manages or provides advice with respect to office, retail and residential real estate for third-party clients, fund investors, and investments held by the Company. In addition to earning property management fees, consulting fees, lease 
 4

commissions, construction management fees, disposition fees, and accounting fees, the property services group gives us insight into local markets and potential acquisitions. 
Brokerage
Our brokerage division represents tenants and landlords on every aspect of site selection, negotiation and occupancy. The division also specializes in innovative marketing programs tailored to client objectives for all types of investment grade and income producing real estate. The division's property marketing programs combine proven techniques with its detailed market knowledge to create optimum results.
Auction and Conventional Sales
Kennedy Wilson was founded in 1977 as a real estate auction business and has since grown into a global real estate company. The auction and conventional sales division provides innovative marketing and sales strategies for all types of commercial and residential real estate, including single family homes, mixed-use developments, estate homes, multifamily dwellings, new home projects, and conversions. Generally, the division's auction sales business is countercyclical to the traditional sales real estate market and has been a bellwether for us in forecasting market conditions. 
Research 
Meyers Research LLC ("Meyers") was a research business specializing in residential real estate research and advisory. We sold the business in December 2018 for $48.0 million and recognized a gain on sale of business of $40.4 million. We used part of the proceeds from such sale to reinvest $15.0 million for an 11% ownership interest in a new partnership between Meyers Research and another premiere residential real estate construction service company. We no longer control Meyers and will treat the new investment as an unconsolidated investment. 
Value Creation
Our differentiated and unique approach to investing is the cornerstone of how we create value for our shareholders. Our investment philosophy is based on three core fundamentals:

• | Leverage our global footprint and complementary investments and services businesses to identify attractive investment markets across the world.


• | Selectively invest in opportunities across many real estate product types with a goal of maximizing cash flow and risk-adjusted return on capital.


• | Actively manage assets and finance our assets in a manner designed to generate stable, predictable and growing cash flows for shareholders and clients.

Kennedy Wilson is able to create value for its shareholders in the following ways:

• | We are able to identify and acquire attractive real estate assets across many markets, in part due to the significant proprietary deal flow driven from an established global network of industry relationships, particularly with financial institutions. This can create value by allowing us to maintain and develop a large pipeline of attractive opportunities. 


• | Our operating expertise allows us to focus on opportunistic investments where we believe we can increase the value of assets and cash flows, and include transactions with distressed real estate owners or lenders seeking liquidity, or purchases of under-managed or under-leased assets, and repositioning opportunities.


• | Many times, these investments are acquired at a discount to replacement cost or recent comparative sales, thereby offering opportunities to achieve above average total returns. In many cases, this may lead to significant additional returns, such as a promoted interest (where we have partners), based on the performance of the assets. 


• | Our long-lasting and deep relationships with financial institutions allow us to refinance loans to reduce interest rates and/or increase borrowings due to property appreciation and thereby obtain cash flow to use for new investments. We generally implement this strategy after our value-add initiatives have been executed, thus allowing us to maintain moderate levels of leverage.


• | We have been able to attract third party capital due to our ability to generate above-market returns for our partners, diversity of geographic markets and investment product types as well as our flexibility in structuring deals through funds, separate accounts and equity partner arrangements.


• | KW Investment Management and Real Estate Services (IMRES) plays a critical role in supporting our investment strategy by providing local market intelligence and real-time data for evaluating investments, generating proprietary transaction flow and creating value through efficient implementation of asset management or repositioning strategies.

• | We understand that real estate is cyclical. Our management team employs a multi-cyclical approach that has resulted in our IMRES AUM being globally diversified across many sectors of real estate while maintaining a healthy liquidity position and adequate access to capital. 

Competitive Strengths
We have a unique platform from which to execute our investment and services strategy. The combination of an investment platform and a service business provides several competitive strengths when compared to other real estate buyers and asset managers operating stand-alone or investment-focused firms and may allow us to generate superior risk-adjusted returns. Our investment strategy focuses on investments that offer significant appreciation potential through intensive asset management, leasing, repositioning, redevelopment and the opportunistic use of capital. We differentiate ourselves from other firms in the industry with our full service, investment-oriented structure. Whereas most other firms use an investment platform to obtain additional service business revenue, we use our service platform to enhance the investment process and ensure the alignment of interests with our investors.
Our competitive strengths include:

• | Transaction experience: Our senior management team has an average of 23 years of real estate experience and has been working and investing together on average for over 10 years. Members of the senior management team have collectively acquired, developed and managed in excess of $30 billion of real estate investments in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Italy and Japan throughout various economic cycles, both at our Company and throughout their careers.


• | Extensive relationship and sourcing network: We leverage our relationships in order to source off-market deals. In addition, the senior management team and our acquisition team have transacted deals in nearly every major metropolitan market on the West Coast of the United States, as well as in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Italy and Japan. Their local presence and reputation in these markets have enabled them to cultivate key relationships with major holders of property inventory, in particularly financial institutions, throughout the real estate community.


• | Structuring expertise and speed of execution: Prior acquisitions completed by us have taken a variety of forms, including direct property investments, joint ventures, exchanges involving stock or operating partnership units, participating loans and investments in performing and non-performing mortgages at various capital stack positions with the objective of long-term ownership. We believe we have developed a reputation of being able to quickly execute, as well as originate and creatively structure acquisitions, dispositions and financing transactions.


• | Vertically integrated platform for operational enhancement: We have over 375 employees in both KW Investments and IMRES, with 17 offices throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Jersey and Japan. We have a hands-on approach to real estate investing and possess the local expertise in property and asset management, leasing, construction management, development and investment sales, which we believe enable us to invest successfully in selected submarkets.


• | Risk protection and investment discipline: We underwrite our investments based upon a thorough examination of property economics and a critical understanding of market dynamics and risk management strategies. We conduct an in-depth sensitivity analysis on each of our acquisitions. This analysis applies various economic scenarios that include changes to rental rates, absorption periods, operating expenses, interest rates, exit values and holding periods. We use this analysis to develop our disciplined acquisition strategies.


• | Management's alignment with shareholders: As of December 31, 2018, our directors and executive officers and their respective affiliates owned an aggregate of approximately 14% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Due to management team's ownership interest in the Company its interests are in alignment with common shareholders of the Company. 

The real estate business is cyclical. Real estate cycles are generally impacted by many factors, including availability of equity and debt capital, borrowing cost, rent levels, and asset values. Our strategy has resulted in a strong track record of creating both asset and entity value for the benefit of our shareholders and partners over these various real estate cycles.
Industry Overview 
Key Investment Markets
Western United States
In 2018, the U.S. real estate market continued to improve benefiting from fiscal stimulus and record-low unemployment. U.S. GDP growth accelerated to an estimated 3.0% from 2.2% in 2017. The job market continued to improve during the year, with 
 6

payrolls growing at a faster rate in 2018 as compared to 2016 and 2017. The unemployment rate ended the year at 3.9%, down from 4.1% in December 2017. 
The demand for multifamily housing remained strong in 2018, despite the elevated level of new supply. A significant portion of new construction continues to be centered around the urban core in large metropolitan cities in the Western U.S. However, Kennedy Wilson's portfolio is largely comprised of garden style communities in suburban locations. Demand for workforce housing has exceeded supply, resulting in above-average rent growth. The multifamily market is expected to remain healthy in 2019, as demographic and lifestyle preferences, along with the financial challenges of homeownership, continue to drive demand.
The U.S. office market is expected to have moderate growth in 2019, with office-using employment expected to grow by 1.6% or more than 300,000 jobs. Kennedy Wilson's U.S. office portfolio is primarily located in Southern California and the Greater Seattle market, which both continue to benefit from the expansion of large tech companies. Demand remains firm heading into 2019, with much of the new supply already preleased. Tenants in the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) industries and flexible space providers are expected to continue fueling demand for office space.
 The U.S. economic outlook for 2019 remains positive, with consumer and business confidence remaining high. However, a number of important factors will continue to play a large role in the performance of real estate in 2019, including the future direction of interest rates, upward inflationary pressures, and the effect on the US economy from the on-going US trade war with China.
Hawaii
In Hawaii, natural disasters were the headline stories in 2018 with major flooding on Kauai and volcanic eruptions on the Big Island (where we hold an interest in a residential development project and the Kona Village Resort).  The volcanic eruption that lasted between the months of May to August 2018 had a measurable adverse impact on tourism to the Big Island, which led to a decrease in visitors and sales volume at our residential development project during 2018 as compared to 2017.  However, visitor volumes and transactional activity have increased at our project since August 2018 and the Company believes that the natural disasters, primarily the volcanic eruptions, did not affect the long-term viability of its investments on the Big Island. 
Even with the natural disasters and the nationwide media coverage of the same, Hawaii’s economy in 2018 remained favorable, with record-low unemployment and an increase in the number of visitors to the Hawaiian Islands overall (as discussed above, tourism was down for the Big Island during 2018).  Major economic drivers included a strong global economy in the Pacific region, increased airline seat capacity, and ready access to non-traditional accommodations.  In 2019, Hawaii’s economy is expected to continue expanding albeit at a modestly slower pace than in 2018. The Hawaiian economy, which had the country's second lowest unemployment rate at year-end of 2.5%, continues to depend significantly on the US economy and certain key international economies, especially Japan.
United Kingdom
             Despite the challenging political outlook following the lack of clarity over the terms of the U.K.’s exit from the European Union and the terms of the U.K.’s future relationship with the European Union, the U.K. economy continues to be relatively resilient. Unemployment rates in the U.K. were approximately 4% in 2018, a near record figure. The tight labor market has translated to real wage growth, growing at its fastest rate in a decade, up 3.4% compared to 2017. 
Investment volumes in the U.K. hit £73 billion in 2018, 28% ahead of the 10-year average. Given the U.K.’s attractive market fundamentals and transparent investment environment, foreign investments into the U.K. remained strong in 2018, making up 46% of the total investment volume.
Central London office investment and occupational market fundamentals remain strong, underpinned by London’s world-class city status. Significant infrastructure improvements, with the arrival of Crossrail, a world-leading cultural standing and a level of diversity and talent that few cities enjoy, London continues to lure significant investments from global tech companies retaining its top spot in Europe for technology investment funding in 2018. London office absorption of 13.7 million square feet, exceeded the last two years and was above the 10-year average absorption of 12.8 million square feet. 
The U.K. retail sector remains under pressure, with weakening occupation demand as a number of high-profile retailers have gone into bankruptcy during 2018. Rent pressure is particularly being felt on secondary and tertiary retail assets, while retail assets that serve as popular and convenient destinations continue to perform strongly.
Prime industrial continues to outperform, with capital value growth of 12% over 2018, driven by shifts to e-commerce. Core locations, longer-dated income and inflation-linked rental increases remain in high demand, as the Company has seen across its own industrial portfolio.
 7

Ireland 
Ireland’s economy remains the best performing in Europe for the fifth consecutive year, with unemployment at 5.7%, the lowest rate in over a decade. Strong economic activity has contributed to an active investment market with strong employment fundamentals. Investment volume for 2018 was €3.6 billion, significantly up compared to €2.3 billion in 2017. Office and multifamily transactions represented almost one-third of investment volume in 2018. A strong handful of institutions have announced new funds targeting multifamily assets in Dublin with billions of institutional equity available for this relatively new asset class for Ireland. A further benefit to the depth of the market is that the pool of buyers has expanded further with more institutional purchasers and purchasers from Asia. 
Dublin office absorption reached a peak of 3.9 million square feet in 2018, compared to the 10-year average of 2.25 million square feet. Leasing activity was significantly buoyed by the single largest lease deal ever recorded to Facebook for 825,000 square feet. Momentum for 2019 remains strong with 1.6 million square feet reserved at the end of the year. Both city center rents and those in the south suburbs, where our own office portfolio is based, remained stable at approximately €65.00 per square foot and €28.50 per square foot, respectively.
The Dublin multifamily sector continues to demonstrate strong fundamentals, with 60% of the population under the age of 35 now renting in Dublin and home ownership continuing to decline. Ireland benefits from the highest level of natural population growth at 6.6% among EU countries. 
Prime retail rents, driven by Grafton Street Zone A rents, of €585 per square foot remained flat year-on-year. With strong Irish economic indicators coupled with solid consumer sentiment and tourist activity, the retail sales index continues its upward trajectory, up 4.0% year-on-year (as of Q3-18), according to the Central Statistics Office of Ireland . Dublin is also on the radar for international retailers looking to grow their European portfolios with strong demand for prime high street and retail schemes, with a number of retailers announcing their first stores in Dublin in 2018.             
2018 was very positive for Irish hoteliers, underpinned by healthy economic activity, increased air connectivity, and record tourism numbers with more than 11 million visitors last year, over twice the population of the Republic of Ireland. This has led to improved revenue per available room and average room rates in Dublin hotels, up 10% and 7.3% year-over-year (as of Q3-18), respectively. 
Other Smaller Investment Markets
Spain
The Spanish retail sector continues to be fueled by improving economic indicators, coupled with decreases in unemployment, driving stronger Spanish households’ purchasing power and generating positive foot traffic improvements. Tourism continues to play a key role, up 1.1% year-on-year, keeping Spain as the second most visited country in the world. 
Spanish retail investment volume reached €3.4 billion in 2018, well above the ten-year average investment volume, with prime retail yields remaining at historic lows, driven by strong levels of institutional demand. 
This activity continues to fuel our retail portfolio, where we are seeing positive signs across high street retail employment and investment markets in central Madrid. Against this backdrop, prime Madrid high street retail has benefited from 5.0% year-on-year rental growth and we expect a moderate level of rental increases across the retail sector, especially in prime areas in the near-to medium-term.
Competition
We compete with a range of global, national and local real estate firms, individual investors and other corporations, both private and public. Because of our unique mix of investments and services businesses, we compete with companies that invest in real estate and loans secured by real estate along with brokerage and property management companies. Our investment business competes with real estate investment partnerships, real estate investments trusts, private equity firms and other investment companies and regional investors and developers. We believe that our relationships with the sellers and our ability to close an investment transaction in a short time period at competitive pricing provide us a competitive advantage. The real estate services business is both highly fragmented and competitive. We compete with real estate brokerage and auction companies on the basis of our relationship with property owners, quality of service, and commissions charged. We compete with property management and leasing firms also on the basis of our relationship with clients, the range and quality of services provided, and fees and commissions charged.

Foreign Currency
Approximately 49% of our investment account is invested through our foreign platforms in their local currencies. Investment level debt is generally incurred in local currencies and we consider our equity investment as the appropriate exposure to evaluate for balance sheet hedging purposes. We typically do not hedge future operations or cash flows of operations in foreign exchanges rates which may have a significant impact on the results of our operations. In order to manage the effect of these fluctuations, we generally hedge our book equity exposure to foreign currencies through currency forward contracts and options. Please refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation for a discussion regarding foreign currency and currency derivative instruments.
Transaction-based Results
A significant portion of our cash flow is tied to transaction activity which can affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis or to easily evaluate the breadth of our operation. Historically, this variability has caused our revenue, net income and cash flows to be tied to transaction activity, which is not necessarily concentrated in any one quarter. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we have over 375 employees in 17 offices throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Jersey and Japan. We believe that we have been able to attract and maintain high quality employees. There are no employees subject to collective bargaining agreements. In addition, we believe we have a good relationship with our employees.

Non-GAAP Measures and Certain Definitions
 “KWH,” "KW," “Kennedy Wilson,” the "Company," "we," "our," or "us" refers to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the results of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries.
“KWE” refers to Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate plc, which was a London Stock Exchange-listed company that we externally managed through a wholly-owned subsidiary.  On October 20, 2017 we acquired KWE, which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary. Prior to the acquisition, we owned approximately 24% and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the results of KWE were consolidated in our financial statements due to our role as asset manager.  
"Acquisition-related gains" consist of non-cash gains recognized by the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries upon a GAAP -required fair value measurement due to a business combination. These gains are typically recognized when a loan is converted into consolidated real estate owned and the fair value of the underlying real estate at the time of conversion exceeds the basis in the previously held loan. These gains also arise when there is a change of control of an investment. The gain amount is based upon the fair value of the Company’s or its consolidated subsidiaries' equity in the investment in excess of the carrying amount of the equity immediately preceding the change of control.  
“Adjusted EBITDA” represents net income before interest expense, our share of interest expense included in income from investments in unconsolidated investments, depreciation and amortization, our share of depreciation and amortization included in income from unconsolidated investments, early extinguishment of corporate debt, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, share-based compensation expense for the Company and EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests.  Please also see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP measures” for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income as reported under GAAP. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA to analyze our business because it adjusts net income for items we believe do not accurately reflect the nature of our business going forward or that relate to non-cash compensation expense or noncontrolling interests. Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. Additionally, we believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to assist

them in getting a more accurate picture of our results from operations. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use, as it does not remove all non-cash items (such as acquisition-related gains) or consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The amount shown for Adjusted EBITDA also differs from the amount calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.  
“Adjusted Fees’’ refers to Kennedy Wilson’s gross investment management, property services and research fees adjusted to include Kennedy Wilson's share of fees eliminated in consolidation, Kennedy Wilson’s share of fees in unconsolidated service businesses and performance fees included in unconsolidated investments. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted new GAAP guidance on revenue recognition and implemented a change in accounting principles related to performance allocations, which resulted in us now accounting for performance allocations (commonly referred to as “performance fees” or “carried interest”) under the GAAP guidance for equity method investments and presenting performance allocations as a component of income from unconsolidated investments. Our management uses Adjusted fees to analyze our investment management and real estate services business because the measure removes required eliminations under GAAP for properties in which the Company provides services but also has an ownership interest. These eliminations understate the economic value of the investment management, property services and research fees and makes the Company comparable to other real estate companies that provide investment management and real estate services but do not have an ownership interest in the properties they manage. Our management believes that adjusting GAAP fees to reflect these amounts eliminated in consolidation presents a more holistic measure of the scope of our investment management and real estate services business.
“Adjusted Net Income” represents net income before depreciation and amortization, our share of depreciation and amortization included in income from unconsolidated investments, share-based compensation, the tax impact of the recently enacted tax reform and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, before depreciation and amortization. Please also see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP measures” for a reconciliation of Adjusted Income to net income as reported under GAAP. 
"Equity partners" refers to non-wholly-owned subsidiaries that we consolidate in our financial statements under U.S. GAAP and third-party equity providers.
"Fee Bearing Capital" represents total third-party committed or invested capital that we manage in our joint-ventures and commingled funds that entitle us to earn fees, including without limitation, asset management fees, construction management fees, acquisition and disposition fees and/or promoted interest, if applicable. 
"Gross Asset Value” refers to the gross carrying value of assets, before debt, depreciation and amortization, and net of noncontrolling interests.

"Investment Management and Real Estate Services Assets under Management" ("IMRES AUM") generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide (or participate in) oversight, investment management services and other advice, and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans, and investments in joint ventures. Our IMRES AUM is principally intended to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market, not the basis for determining our management fees. Our IMRES AUM consists of the total estimated fair value of the real estate properties and other real estate related assets either owned by third parties, wholly owned by us or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested. Committed (but unfunded) capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in our IMRES AUM. The estimated value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost. 
 "Noncontrolling interests" represents the portion of equity ownership in a consolidated subsidiary not attributable to Kennedy Wilson. 
 “Same property” refers to properties in which Kennedy Wilson has an ownership interest during the entire span of both periods being compared.  The same property information presented throughout this report is shown on a cash basis and excludes non-recurring expenses. This analysis excludes properties that are either under development or undergoing lease up as part of our asset management strategy.
