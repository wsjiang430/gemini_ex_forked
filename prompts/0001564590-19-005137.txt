Item 1. Business. 
 We are an internally managed real estate company that acquires, owns and manages primarily single-tenant properties that are net leased on a long-term basis to middle-market companies operating service-oriented or experience-based businesses. We have assembled a diversified portfolio using an investment strategy that focuses on properties leased to tenants in businesses such as restaurants (including quick service and casual and family dining), car washes, automotive services, medical services, convenience stores, entertainment, early childhood education and health and fitness. We believe that properties leased to tenants in these businesses are essential to the generation of the tenants’ sales and profits and that these businesses exhibit favorable growth potential and are generally more insulated from e-commerce pressure than many others.
 We were organized on January 12, 2018 as a Maryland corporation and intend to qualify to be taxed as a REIT beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, 91.1% of our $106.8 million of annualized base rent was attributable to properties operated by tenants in service-oriented and experience-based businesses. “Annualized base rent” means annualized contractually specified cash base rent in effect on December 31, 2018 for all of our leases (including those accounted for as direct financing leases) commenced as of that date and annualized cash interest on our mortgage loans receivable as of that date.
 Our objective is to maximize stockholder value by generating attractive risk-adjusted returns through owning, managing and growing a diversified portfolio of commercially desirable properties. We have grown strategically since commencing investment activities in June 2016. As of December 31, 2018, we had a portfolio of 677 properties (including one undeveloped land parcel, 12 properties that secure our investment in mortgage loans receivable and four properties under development) built on the following core attributes:
 Diversified Portfolio.    Our portfolio was 100% occupied by 161 tenants operating 180 different brands, or concepts, in 15 industries across 43 states, with none of our tenants contributing more than 5% of our annualized base rent. Our strategy targets a scaled portfolio that, over time, derives no more than 5% of its annualized base rent from any single tenant or more than 1% from any single property. 
 2

Remaining Lease Term of 14.2 Years.    Our leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 14.2 years (based on annualized base rent), with only 3.1% of our annualized base rent attributable to leases expiring prior to January 1, 2023. Our properties are subject to relatively new, long-term net leases that we believe provide us a stable base of revenue from which to grow our portfolio.
 Significant Use of Master Leases.    67.4% of our annualized base rent was attributable to master leases.
 Healthy Rent Coverage Ratio and Extensive Tenant Financial Reporting.    Our portfolio’s weighted average rent coverage ratio was 2.8x and 97.5% of our leases (based on annualized base rent) obligate the tenant to periodically provide us with specified unit-level financial reporting. “Rent coverage ratio” means the ratio of (x) tenant-reported or, when unavailable, management’s estimate (based on tenant-reported financial information) of annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and cash rent attributable to the leased property (or properties, in the case of a master lease) to (y) the annualized base rental obligation as of a specified date.
 Contractual Base Rent Escalation.    97.1% of our leases (based on annualized base rent) provided for increases in future base rent at a weighted average rate of 1.5% per year.
 Differentiated Investment Approach.    Our average investment per property was $2 million (which equals our aggregate investment in our properties (including transaction costs, lease incentives and amounts funded for construction in progress) divided by the number of properties owned at December 31, 2018), and we believe investments of similar size allow us to grow our portfolio without concentrating a large amount of capital in individual properties and limit our exposure to events that may adversely affect a particular property.
2018 Financial and Operating Highlights 
  
• | During the year ended December 31, 2018, we invested approximately $516 million in 215 property locations (excluding one property securing $3.5 million of short-term financing).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As of December 31, 2018, our total gross investment in real estate totaled $1.4 billion and we had total debt of $540.1 million.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | During 2018, we completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 32,500,000 shares of our common stock and issued 2,772,191 additional shares of common stock pursuant to the partial exercise of an option granted to underwriters of our IPO. We received total proceeds of $458.7 million, net of underwriters’ discounts and offering expenses, from the issuance of these shares.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | At the time of the IPO, we also completed a $125.0 million concurrent private placement (the “Concurrent Private Placement”) of our common stock and units of Essential Properties, L.P., which is our operating partnership (the “Operating Partnership”) and through which we hold substantially all of our assets and conduct our operations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | For the period of 2018 subsequent to our IPO, we made distributions totaling $0.434 per share of common stock.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In June 2018, we entered into a four-year, senior unsecured revolving credit facility which allows up to $300.0 million in principal borrowings (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).

Our Target Market
 We are an active investor in single-tenant, net leased real estate. Our target properties are generally freestanding, commercial real estate facilities where a middle-market tenant conducts activities that are 
 3

essential to the generation of its sales and profits. We believe that this market is underserved from a capital perspective and offers attractive investment opportunities.
 Within this market, we emphasize investment in properties leased to tenants engaged in a targeted set of service-oriented or experience-based businesses, such as restaurants (including quick service and casual and family dining), car washes, automotive services, medical services, convenience stores, entertainment, early childhood education, and health and fitness because we believe these businesses are generally more insulated from e-commerce pressure than many others. In addition, we believe that many of these businesses are favorably impacted by current macroeconomic trends that support consumer spending, such as generally declining unemployment and positive consumer sentiment.
 We also focus on properties leased to middle-market companies, which we define as regional and national operators with between 10 and 250 locations and $20 million to $500 million in annual revenue, and we opportunistically invest in properties leased to smaller companies, which we define as regional operators with less than 10 locations and less than $20 million in annual revenue. Although it is not our primary investment focus, we will opportunistically consider investments leased to large companies. While most of our targeted tenants are not rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, we primarily seek to invest in properties leased to companies that we determine have attractive credit characteristics and stable operating histories.
 Despite the market’s size, the market for single-tenant, net leased real estate is highly fragmented. In particular, we believe that there is a limited number of participants addressing the long-term capital needs of unrated middle-market and small companies. We believe that many publicly traded REITs that invest in net leased properties concentrate their investment activity in properties leased to investment grade-rated tenants, which tend to be larger organizations, with the result that unrated, middle-market and small companies are relatively underserved and offer us an attractive investment opportunity.
 Furthermore, we believe that there is strong demand for our net-lease solutions among middle-market and small owner-operators of commercial real estate, in part, due to the bank regulatory environment, which, since the turmoil in the housing and mortgage industries from 2007-2009, has generally been characterized by increased scrutiny and regulation. We believe that this environment has made commercial banks less responsive to the long-term capital needs of unrated middle-market and small companies, many of which have historically depended on commercial banks for their financing; accordingly, we see an attractive opportunity to address the capital needs of these companies by offering them an efficient alternative to financing their real estate with traditional mortgage or bank debt and their own equity.
 Accordingly, while we believe our net-lease financing solutions may be attractive to a wide variety of companies, we believe our most attractive opportunity is owning properties net leased to bank finance-dependent, middle-market and small companies that are generally unrated and have less access to efficient sources of long-term capital than larger, rated companies.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe the following competitive strengths distinguish us from our competitors and allow us to compete effectively in the single-tenant, net-lease market:
  
• | Carefully Constructed Portfolio of Recently Acquired Properties Leased to Service-Oriented or Experience-Based Tenants. We have strategically constructed a portfolio that is diversified by tenant, industry and geography and generally avoids exposure to businesses that we believe are subject to pressure from e-commerce. Our properties are subject to relatively new, long-term net leases that we believe provide us a stable base of revenue from which to grow our portfolio. As of December 31, 2018, we had a portfolio of 677 properties, with annualized base rent of $106.8 million, which was selected by our management team in 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

accordance with our focused investment strategy. Our portfolio is diversified with 161 tenants operating 180 different concepts across 43 states and 15 industries. None of our tenants contributed more than 5% of our annualized base rent as of December 31, 2018, and our strategy targets a scaled portfolio that, over time, derives no more than 5% of its annualized base rent from any single tenant or more than 1% from any single property.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We focus on investing in properties leased to tenants operating in service-oriented or experience-based businesses, such as restaurants (including quick service and casual and family dining), car washes, automotive services, medical services, convenience stores, entertainment, early childhood education and health and fitness, which we believe are generally more insulated from e-commerce pressure than many others. As of December 31, 2018, 91.1% of our annualized base rent was attributable to tenants operating service-oriented and experience-based businesses.
 We believe that our portfolio’s diversity and recent underwriting decreases the impact on us of an adverse event affecting a specific tenant, industry or region, and our focus on leasing to tenants in industries that we believe are well-positioned to withstand competition from e-commerce increases the stability of our rental revenue.
  
• | Experienced and Proven Net Lease Management Team. Our senior management has significant experience in the net lease industry and a track record of growing net lease businesses to significant scale, and it was directly responsible for sourcing, financing and acquiring each of the properties in our portfolio. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our senior management team has been responsible for our refined investment strategy and for developing and implementing our investment sourcing, underwriting, closing and asset management functions, which we believe can support significant investment growth without a proportionate increase in our operating expenses. As of December 31, 2018, exclusive of our initial investment activity on June 16, 2016 when we acquired a portfolio of 262 net leased properties, consisting primarily of restaurants, that were being sold as part of the liquidation of General Electric Capital Corporation for an aggregate purchase price of $279.8 million (including transaction costs) (the “GE Seed Portfolio”), 82.2% of our portfolio’s annualized base rent was attributable to internally originated sale-leaseback transactions and 92.1% was acquired from parties who had previously engaged in one or more transactions that involved a member of our senior management team (including operators and tenants and other participants in the net lease industry, such as brokers, intermediaries and financing sources). The substantial experience, knowledge and relationships of our senior leadership team provide us with an extensive network of contacts that we believe allows us to originate attractive investment opportunities and effectively grow our business.
  
• | Growth Oriented Balance Sheet Supporting Scalable Infrastructure. As of December 31, 2018, we had $549.1 million of gross debt outstanding, with a weighted average maturity of 4.1 years, and net debt of $532.9 million. For the three months ended December 31, 2018, our net income was $8.2 million, our Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre was $102.3 million and our ratio of net debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre was 5.2x. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Net debt and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre are non-GAAP financial measures. For definitions of net debt and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre, reconciliations of these measures to total debt and net income, respectively, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and a statement of why our management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and a discussion of how management uses these measures, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

In June 2018, we entered into the Revolving Credit Facility, which is a four-year, senior unsecured revolving credit facility that allows for up to $300.0 million in principal borrowings and is available for general corporate purposes, including funding future acquisitions. As of December 31, 2018, we had borrowed $34.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility and had an available borrowing capacity of $266.0 million. Our borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility initially bear interest at an annual rate of (i) applicable LIBOR plus an applicable margin between 1.45% and 2.15%; or (ii) the base rate (which rate is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% or LIBOR plus 1.0%) plus an applicable margin of between 0.45% and 1.15%.
 Our largest borrowing source is our private conduit program (the “Master Trust Funding Program”), under which we may, subject to applicable covenants, issue multiple series and classes of notes from time to time to institutional investors in the asset-backed securities market. As of December 31, 2018, we had Class A Notes and Class B Notes outstanding under our Master Trust Funding Program with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $515.1 million and a weighted average annual interest rate of 4.35%. These notes are secured by a pool of 347 properties and the related leases as of December 31, 2018; however, we have the ability to prepay these notes without the payment of a make-whole amount after November 2021, giving us flexibility to unencumber the pledged assets, should we choose to do so as part of a strategy to seek an investment grade credit rating in the future or for other reasons. Prepayments with respect to notes issued under our Master Trust Funding Program with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $272.3 million (as of December 31, 2018) on or after November 25, 2019 do not require a make-whole payment, and prepayments with respect to notes issued under our Master Trust Funding Program with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $242.8 million (as of December 31, 2018) on or after November 25, 2021 do not require a make-whole payment. These notes are non-recourse to us, subject to customary limited exceptions.
 We are the property manager and servicer for the leases that are the collateral for the notes under our Master Trust Funding Program and, in that capacity, have discretion in managing the collateral pool. We believe that this discretion enhances our operational flexibility by enabling us to: issue additional notes in future series that reflect the increase in the value of properties or the entire collateral pool; substitute assets in the collateral pool (subject to meeting certain prescribed conditions and criteria); and sell underperforming assets and reinvest the proceeds in better performing properties, subject, in the case of substitutions and sales, to certain limitations unless the substitution or sale is credit- or risk-based. We also have the ability to add properties to the collateral pool between series issuances, thereby further increasing the pool’s size and diversity. By issuing investment grade-rated debt through the Master Trust Funding Program, we seek to lower our borrowing costs and, in turn, be in a position to deliver more competitive financial terms to our tenants and attractive returns to our stockholders.
 We also have 330 unencumbered properties that contribute $58.2 million of annualized base rent as of December 31, 2018. We seek to manage our balance sheet so that we have access to multiple sources of debt capital in the future, such as term borrowings from insurance companies, banks and other sources, single-asset mortgage financing and CMBS borrowings, that may offer us the opportunity to lower our cost of funding and further diversify our sources of debt capital.
  
• | Differentiated Investment Strategy. We seek to acquire and lease freestanding, single-tenant commercial real estate facilities where a tenant services its customers and conducts activities that are essential to the generation of its sales and profits. We primarily seek to invest in properties leased to unrated middle-market companies that we determine have attractive credit characteristics and stable operating histories. We believe middle-market companies are underserved from a capital perspective and that we can offer them attractive real estate financing solutions and enter into lease agreements that provide us with attractive 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

risk-adjusted returns. Furthermore, many net lease transactions with middle-market companies involve properties that are individually relatively small, which allows us to avoid concentrating a large amount of capital in individual properties. We maintain close relationships with our tenants, which we believe allows us to source additional investments and become the capital provider of choice as our tenants’ businesses grow and their real estate needs increase.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Asset Base Allows for Significant Growth. Building on our senior leadership team’s experience of more than 20 years in net lease real estate investing, we have developed leading origination, underwriting, financing, documentation and property management capabilities. Our platform is scalable, and we will seek to leverage these capabilities to improve our efficiency and processes to seek attractive risk-adjusted growth. While we expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to rise in some measure as our portfolio grows, we expect that such expenses as a percentage of our portfolio will decrease over time due to efficiencies and economies of scale. We have grown substantially since we commenced investment activities on June 16, 2016 when we acquired our GE Seed Portfolio for $279.8 million (including transaction costs). During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, we purchased properties with aggregate purchase prices of $535.4 million and $521.8 million, respectively. With our smaller asset base relative to other institutional investors that focus on acquiring net leased real estate, we believe that superior growth can be achieved through manageable acquisition volume.

• | Disciplined Underwriting Leading to Strong Portfolio Characteristics. We generally seek to execute transactions with an aggregate purchase price of $3 million to $50 million. Our size allows us to focus on investing in a segment of the market that we believe is underserved from a capital perspective and where we can originate or acquire relatively smaller assets on attractive terms that provide meaningful growth to our portfolio. In addition, we seek to invest in commercially desirable properties that are suitable for use by different tenants, offer attractive risk-adjusted returns and possess characteristics that reduce our real estate investment risks. As of December 31, 2018:

• | Extensive Tenant Financial Reporting Supports Active Asset Management.

As of December 31, 2018, leases contributing 97.5% of our

Our Business and Growth Strategies
 Our objective is to maximize stockholder value by generating attractive risk-adjusted returns through owning, managing and growing a diversified portfolio of commercially desirable properties. We intend to pursue our objective through the following business and growth strategies.

• | Structure and Manage Our Diverse Portfolio with Disciplined Underwriting and Risk Management. We seek to maintain the stability of our rental revenue and maximize the long-term return on our investments while continuing our growth by using our disciplined underwriting and risk management expertise. When underwriting assets, we emphasize commercially desirable properties, with strong operating performance, healthy rent coverage ratios and tenants with attractive credit characteristics. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Leasing.    In general, we seek to enter into leases with (i) relatively long terms (typically with initial terms of 15 years or more and tenant renewal options); (ii) attractive rent escalation provisions; (iii) healthy rent coverage ratios; and (iv) tenant obligations to periodically provide us with financial information, which provides us with information about the operating performance of the leased property and/or tenant and allows us to actively monitor the security of payments under the lease on an ongoing basis. We strongly prefer to use master lease structures, pursuant to which we lease multiple properties to a single tenant on a unitary (i.e., “all or none”) basis. In addition, in the context of our sale-leaseback investments, we generally seek to establish contract rents that are at prevailing market rents, which we believe enhances tenant retention and reduces our releasing risk if a lease is rejected in a bankruptcy proceeding or expires.
 Diversification.    We monitor and manage the diversification of our portfolio in order to reduce the risks associated with adverse developments affecting a particular tenant, property, industry or region. Our strategy targets a scaled portfolio that, over time, will (1) derive no more than 5% of its annualized base from any single tenant or more than 1% of its annualized base rent from any single property, (2) be primarily leased to tenants operating in service-oriented or experience-based businesses and (3) avoid significant geographic concentration. While we consider these criteria when making investments, we may be opportunistic in managing our business and make investments that do not meet one or more of these criteria if we believe the opportunity presents an attractive risk-adjusted return. 
 Asset Management.    We are an active asset manager and regularly review each of our properties for changes in the business performance at the property, credit of the tenant and local real estate market conditions. Among other things, we use Moody’s Analytics RiskCalc (“RiskCalc”), which is a model for predicting private company defaults based on Moody’s Analytics Credit Research Database, to proactively detect credit deterioration. Additionally, we monitor market rents relative to in-place rents and the amount of tenant capital expenditures in order to refine our tenant retention and alternative use assumptions. Our management team utilizes our internal credit diligence to monitor the credit profile of each of our tenants on an ongoing basis. We believe that this proactive approach enables us to identify and address issues expeditiously and to determine whether there are properties in our portfolio that are appropriate for disposition.
 In addition, as part of our active portfolio management, we may selectively dispose of assets that we conclude do not offer a return commensurate with the investment risk, contribute to unwanted geographic, industry or tenant concentrations, or may be sold at a price we determine is attractive. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold 45 properties for net sales proceeds of $60.2 million, representing a 3.6% gain compared to our gross investment in these assets of $58.1 million.

• | Focus on Relationship-Based Sourcing to Grow Our Portfolio by Originating Sale-Leaseback Transactions. We plan to continue our disciplined growth by originating sale-leaseback transactions and opportunistically making acquisitions of properties subject to net leases that contribute to our portfolio’s tenant, industry and geographic diversification. Since we commenced investment activities in June 2016, our senior management team has sourced, underwritten, negotiated and structured 175 investment transactions that have closed. As of December 31, 2018, exclusive of our GE Seed Portfolio, 82.2% of our portfolio’s annualized base rent was attributable to internally originated sale-leaseback transactions and 92.1% was acquired from parties who had previously engaged in transactions that involved a member of our senior management team (including operators and tenants and other participants in the net lease industry, such as brokers, intermediaries and financing sources). In addition, we seek to leverage our relationships with our tenants to facilitate investment opportunities, including selectively agreeing to reimburse certain of our tenants for development costs at our properties in exchange for contractually specified rent that generally increases proportionally with our funding. As of December 31, 2018, exclusive of our GE Seed Portfolio, approximately 48.2% of our investments were sourced from operators and tenants who had previously consummated a transaction involving a member of our management team, and approximately 43.9% were sourced from participants in the net lease industry, such as brokers, intermediaries or financing sources, who had previously been involved with a transaction involving a member of our management team. We believe our senior management team’s reputation, in-depth market knowledge and extensive network of long-standing relationships in the net lease industry provide us access to an ongoing pipeline of attractive investment opportunities. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As of February 22, 2019, we have entered into purchase and sale agreements for 20 properties with an aggregate purchase price of $40.1 million.
  
• | Focus on Middle-Market Companies in Service-Oriented or Experience-Based Businesses. We primarily focus on investing in properties that we lease on a long-term, triple-net basis to unrated middle-market companies that we determine have attractive credit characteristics and stable operating histories. Properties leased to middle-market companies may offer us the opportunity to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns, as a result of our intensive credit and real estate analysis, lease structuring and portfolio construction. We believe our capital solutions are attractive to middle-market companies due to their more limited financing options, as compared to larger, rated organizations, and, in many cases, smaller transactions with middle-market companies will allow us to maintain and grow our portfolio’s diversification. Middle-market companies are often willing to enter into leases with structures and terms that we consider attractive (such as master leases and leases that require ongoing tenant financial reporting) and believe contribute to the stability of our rental revenue. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, we emphasize investment in properties leased to tenants engaged in service-oriented or experience-based businesses, such as restaurants (including quick service and casual and family dining), car washes, automotive services, medical services, convenience stores, entertainment, early childhood education, and health and fitness, as we believe these businesses are generally more insulated from e-commerce pressure than many others.
  
• | Internal Growth Through Long-Term Triple-Net Leases That Provide for Periodic Rent Escalations. We seek to enter into long-term (typically with initial terms of 15 years or more and tenant renewal options), triple-net leases that provide for periodic contractual rent escalations. As of December 31, 2018, our leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 14.2 years (based on annualized base rent), with only 3.1% of our annualized base rent attributable to leases expiring prior to January 1, 2023, and 97.1% of our leases (based on annualized base rent) provided for increases in future base rent at a weighted average of 1.5% per year. Additionally, our underwriting and active asset management, which we believe

reduce default losses and increase renewal probabilities, is intended to enhance the stability of our rental revenue.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Actively Manage Our Balance Sheet to Maximize Capital Efficiency. We seek to maintain a prudent balance between debt and equity financing and to maintain funding sources that lock in long-term investment spreads and limit interest rate sensitivity. As of December 31, 2018, we had $549.1 million of gross debt outstanding and net debt of $532.9 million. Our net income for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was $8.2 million, our Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre was $102.3 million and our ratio of net debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre was 5.2x. We target a level of net debt that, over time, is generally less than six times our Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre. We have access to multiple sources of debt capital, including the investment grade-rated, asset-backed bond market, through our Master Trust Funding Program, and bank debt, through the Revolving Credit Facility. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Net debt and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
 Competition
 We face competition for acquisitions of real property from investors, including traded and non-traded public REITs, private equity investors and institutional investment funds, some of which have greater financial resources than we do, a greater ability to borrow funds to acquire properties and the ability to accept more risk. We also believe that competition for real estate financing comes from middle-market business owners themselves, many of whom have had a historic preference to own, rather than lease, the real estate they use in their businesses. This competition may increase the demand for the types of properties in which we typically invest and, therefore, reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us and increase the prices paid for such acquisition properties. This competition will increase if investments in real estate become more attractive relative to other forms of investment.
 As a landlord, we compete in the multi-billion dollar commercial real estate market with numerous developers and owners of properties, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. Some of our competitors have greater economies of scale, lower costs of capital, access to more resources and greater name recognition than we do. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose our tenants or prospective tenants, and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates or to offer substantial rent abatements, tenant improvement allowances, early termination rights or below-market renewal options in order to retain tenants when our leases expire.

 As of December 31, 2018, we had 18 full-time employees. Our staff is mostly comprised of professional employees engaged in origination, underwriting, closing, financial reporting, portfolio management and capital markets activities essential to our business.
Insurance
 Our tenants are generally required to maintain liability and property insurance coverage for the properties they lease from us pursuant to triple-net leases. These leases generally require our tenants to name us (and any of our lenders that have a mortgage on the property leased by the tenant) as additional insureds on their liability policies and additional named insured and/or loss payee (or mortgagee, in the case of our lenders) on their property policies. Depending on the location of the property, losses of a catastrophic nature, such as those caused by earthquakes and floods, may be covered by insurance policies that are held by our tenant with limitations such as large deductibles or co-payments that a tenant may not be able to meet. In addition, losses of a catastrophic nature, such as those caused by wind/hail, 
 10

hurricanes, terrorism or acts of war, may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. If there is damage to our properties that is not covered by insurance and such properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we will continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties are irreparably damaged. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Properties—Insurance on our properties may not adequately cover all losses and uninsured losses could materially and adversely affect us.”
 In addition to being a named insured on our tenants’ liability policies, we separately maintain commercial general liability coverage. We also maintain full property coverage on all untenanted properties and other property coverage as may be required by our lenders, which are not required to be carried by our tenants under our leases.
 Regulation
 General.     Our properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including those relating to fire and safety requirements, and affirmative and negative covenants and, in some instances, common area obligations. Our tenants have primary responsibility for compliance with these requirements pursuant to our leases. We believe that each of our properties has the necessary permits and approvals.
 Americans With Disabilities Act (“ADA”).     Under Title III of the ADA, and rules promulgated thereunder, in order to protect individuals with disabilities, public accommodations must remove architectural and communication barriers that are structural in nature from existing places of public accommodation to the extent “readily achievable.” In addition, under the ADA, alterations to a place of public accommodation or a commercial facility are to be made so that, to the maximum extent feasible, such altered portions are readily accessible to and usable by disabled individuals. The “readily achievable” standard takes into account, among other factors, the financial resources of the affected site and the owner, lessor or other applicable person.
 Compliance with the ADA, as well as other federal, state and local laws, may require modifications to properties we currently own or may purchase, or may restrict renovations of those properties. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants, as well as the incurrence of the costs of making modifications to attain compliance, and future legislation could impose additional obligations or restrictions on our properties. Although our tenants are generally responsible for all maintenance and repairs of the property pursuant to our lease, including compliance with the ADA and other similar laws or regulations, we could be held liable as the owner of the property for a failure of one of our tenants to comply with these laws or regulations.
 Environmental Matters
 Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations regulate, and impose liability for, releases of hazardous or toxic substances into the environment. Under various of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner, operator or tenant of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances, hazardous wastes or petroleum product releases or threats of releases at the property, and may be held liable to a government entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation, clean-up and monitoring costs incurred by those parties in connection with the actual or threatened contamination. These laws may impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to fault, or whether or not the owner, operator or tenant knew of or caused the presence of the contamination. The liability under these laws may be joint and several for the full amount of the investigation, clean-up and monitoring costs incurred or to be incurred or actions to be undertaken, although a party held jointly and severally liable may seek to obtain contributions from other identified, solvent, responsible parties of their fair share toward these costs. These costs may be substantial, and can exceed the value of the property. In addition, some environmental laws may create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. As the owner or operator of real estate, we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate. The presence of contamination, or the failure to properly remediate contamination, on a property 
 11

may adversely affect the ability of the owner, operator or tenant to sell or rent that property or to borrow using the property as collateral, and may adversely impact our investment in that property.
 Some of our properties contain, have contained, or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Similarly, some of our properties were used in the past for commercial or industrial purposes, or are currently used for commercial purposes, that involve or involved the use of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or are adjacent to or near properties that have been or are used for similar commercial or industrial purposes. These operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, and we could potentially be required to pay to clean up any contamination. In addition, environmental laws regulate a variety of activities that can occur on a property, including the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, air emissions, water discharges and exposure to lead-based paint. Such laws may impose fines or penalties for violations, and may require permits or other governmental approvals to be obtained for the operation of a business involving such activities. As a result of the foregoing, we could be materially and adversely affected.
 Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos-containing material (“ACM”). Federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building’s management to identify and warn, through signs and labels, of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to installed ACM in their building. The regulations also have employee training, record keeping and due diligence requirements pertaining to ACM. Significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations. As a result of these regulations, building owners and those exercising control over a building’s management may be subject to an increased risk of personal injury lawsuits by workers and others exposed to ACM. The regulations may affect the value of a building containing ACM in which we have invested. Federal, state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal, encapsulation, disturbance, handling and/or disposal of ACM when those materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction, remodeling, renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release into the environment of ACM and may provide for fines to, and for third parties to seek recovery from, owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with ACM.
 When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs.
 Before completing any property acquisition, we obtain environmental assessments in order to identify potential environmental concerns at the property. These assessments are carried out in accordance with the Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments (ASTM Practice E 1527-13) as set by ASTM International, formerly known as the American Society for Testing and Materials, and generally include a physical site inspection, a review of relevant federal, state and local environmental and health agency database records, one or more interviews with appropriate site-related personnel, review of the property’s chain of title and review of historical aerial photographs and other information on past uses of the property. These assessments are limited in scope. If, however, recommended in the initial assessments, we may undertake additional assessments such as soil and/or groundwater samplings or other limited subsurface investigations and ACM or mold surveys to test for substances of concern. A prior owner or operator of a property or historic operations at our properties may have created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the 
 12

site assessments. Material environmental conditions may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future, and future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability. If environmental concerns are not satisfactorily resolved in any initial or additional assessments, we may obtain environmental insurance policies to insure against potential environmental risk or loss depending on the type of property, the availability and cost of the insurance and various other factors we deem relevant (i.e., an environmental occurrence affects one of our properties where our lessee may not have the financial capability to honor its indemnification obligations to us). Our ultimate liability for environmental conditions may exceed the policy limits on any environmental insurance policies we obtain, if any.
 Generally, our leases require the lessee to comply with environmental law and provide that the lessee will indemnify us for any loss or expense we incur as a result of lessee’s violation of environmental law or the presence, use or release of hazardous materials on our property attributable to the lessee. If our lessees do not comply with environmental law, or we are unable to enforce the indemnification obligations of our lessees, our results of operations would be adversely affected.
 We cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future. Compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems. If we or our tenants were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities, we could be materially and adversely affected.
