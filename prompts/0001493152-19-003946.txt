Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

General
 
ProPhase Labs, Inc. (“ProPhase” or the “Company”) was initially organized in Nevada in July 1989. Effective June 18, 2015, we changed our state of incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 621 N. Shady Retreat Road, Doylestown, Pennsylvania 18901 and our telephone number is 215-345-0919.
 
We are a vertically integrated and diversified branding, marketing and technology company with deep experience with over-the-counter (“OTC”) consumer healthcare products and dietary supplements and other remedies. We are engaged in the research, development, manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of OTC consumer healthcare products and dietary supplements in the United States. This includes the development and marketing of dietary supplements under the TK Supplements® brand.
 
In addition, we also continue to actively pursue acquisition opportunities for other companies, technologies and products within and outside the consumer products industry.
 
We use a December 31 year-end for financial reporting purposes. References in this Annual Report to “Fiscal 2018” mean the Fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and references to other “Fiscal” years mean the year, that ended on December 31 of the year indicated. The term “we”, “us” or the “Company” as used herein also refer, where appropriate, to the Company, together with its subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires.


Revenues from continuing operations for Fiscal 2018 and 2017 were $13.1 million and $9.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had working capital of approximately $14.0 million, including $6.7 million of marketable securities available for sale. We believe our current working capital is an acceptable and adequate level of working capital to support our business for at least the next twelve months.
 
Net income (loss) for Fiscal 2018 and 2017 were ($1.7) million and $40.6 million, respectively.
 
Contract Manufacturing Services
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pharmaloz Manufacturing, Inc. (“PMI”), is a full service contract manufacturer and distributor of a broad range of non-GMO, organic and/or natural-based cough drops and lozenges and OTC drug and dietary supplement products. Our manufacturing facility, which is located in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, is registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), and is certified organic and kosher. PMI provides product development, pre-commercialization services, production, warehousing and distribution services for its customers.
 
As part of the sale of our Cold-EEZE® Business in March 2017 (see “Discontinued Operations” below), PMI entered into a manufacturing agreement with Mylan Consumer Healthcare Inc. (formerly known as Meda Consumer Healthcare Inc.) (“MCH”) and Mylan Inc. (together with MCH, “Mylan”) to supply various Cold-EEZE® lozenge products to Mylan following the sale for a period of five years with annual renewal options.
 
For each of Fiscal 2018 and 2017, our revenues from continuing operations have come principally from our contract manufacturing services. Three third-party contract manufacturing customers accounted for 45.7%, 31.1%, and 10.9%, respectively, of our Fiscal 2018 revenues from continuing operations. The loss of sales to any one or more of these large third-party contract manufacturing customers could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition, unless we are able to increase revenue from other sources.

TK Supplements® Product Line
 
Our TK Supplements® product line is dedicated to promoting better health, energy and sexual vitality. Each of our herbal supplements is researched to determine the optimum blend of ingredients to ensure our customers receive premium quality products. To achieve this, we formulate with the highest quality ingredients derived from nature and ingredients enhanced by science. Our TK Supplements® product line includes Legendz XL®, a male sexual enhancement, Triple Edge XL®, an energy and stamina booster, and Super Prostaflow+™, a supplement to support prostate and urinary health.
 
In Fiscal 2017, we initiated shipments of Legendz XL® to a national chain drug retailer and several regional retailers. Currently, we are awaiting product acceptance from other national retailers to leverage our existing infrastructure and retail distribution platform during Fiscal 2019. In addition, we have produced, tested and refined a direct response television commercial and initiated television and digital media testing for Legendz XL® for marketing direct to consumers. We have also completed a broad series of clinical studies that support important product claims that have now been incorporated into our product packaging and marketing communications for Legendz XL®.
 
Once we have established a larger retail presence with Legendz XL®, we expect to initiate a TV campaign with short form TV spots as well as other forms of advertising designed to support our retail efforts and generate additional direct-to-consumer sales, a two-pronged strategy of retail and e-commerce consumer engagement. We are preparing to leverage the advertising and targeting technology of PDM to drive e-commerce sales for our e-commerce campaign related to Legendz XL® and Super Prostaflow+™.
 
We plan to introduce Triple Edge XL® as part of our e-commerce initiative in Fiscal 2019.
 
As with any new product launch, we anticipate losses from our TK Supplements® product line as we optimize our market strategy and expand our channels of distribution. There can be no assurance that our strategic focus will result in any revenue growth.
 
Direct Marketing Services
 
In August 2017, we formed ProPhase Digital Media (“PDM”), Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary. Our objective is for PDM to become an independent full-service direct marketing agency. PDM’s first initiative will be to market the TK Supplements® product line.  If successful, this may lead to the marketing of other companies’ consumer products.
Discontinued Operations
 
Prior to March 29, 2017, our flagship OTC drug brand was Cold-EEZE® and our principal product was Cold-EEZE® cold remedy zinc gluconate lozenges. In addition to Cold-EEZE® cold remedy lozenges, we also marketed and distributed non-lozenge forms of our proprietary zinc gluconate formulation, (i) Cold-EEZE® cold remedy QuickMelts®, (ii) Cold-EEZE® Gummies and (iii) Cold-EEZE® cold remedy oral spray.
 
Effective March 29, 2017, we sold our intellectual property rights and other assets related to our Cold-EEZE® brand and product line, including all then current and pipeline over-the-counter allergy, cold, flu, multi-symptom relief and immune support treatments for adults and children to the extent each was, or was intended to be, branded “Cold-EEZE®”, including all formulations and derivatives thereof (collectively referred to as the “Cold-EEZE® Business”) to Mylan. As a consequence of the sale of the Cold-EEZE® Business, for the year ended December 31, 2017, we have classified as discontinued operations (i) all income and expenses attributable to the Cold-EEZE® Business, (ii) the gain from the sale of the Cold-EEZE® Business, and (iii) the income tax expense attributed to the sale of the Cold-EEZE® Business. Excluded from the sale of the Cold-EEZE® Business were our accounts receivable and inventory. We have also retained all liabilities associated with our Cold-EEZE® Business operations arising prior to March 29, 2017.

Seasonality of the Business
 
Our manufacturing revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations. As the majority of products that we manufacture for our customers are OTC healthcare and cold remedy products, our revenues tend to be higher in the first, third and fourth quarters during the cold season. Generally, a cold season is defined as the period from September to March when the incidence of the common cold rises as a consequence of the change in weather and other factors. Revenues are generally at their lowest levels during the second quarter when contract manufacturing demand generally declines.
 
Patents, Trademarks and Royalty Agreements
 
We do not currently own any patents. We maintain various trademarks for our TK Supplements® products including Legendz XL®, Triple Edge XL® and Super ProstaFlow+TM.


Government Regulation
 
Our business is subject to extensive governmental regulation by various federal, state, and local agencies.
 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
 
Pharmaceutical Regulation
 
The manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government, primarily through the FDA and the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), and to a lesser extent by state and local government agencies. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the manufacture, labeling, testing, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of OTC pharmaceutical products.
 
Facilities used in the manufacture, packaging, labeling and repackaging of drug products, including OTC drug products, must be registered with the FDA and are subject to FDA inspection to ensure that drug products are manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMPs”).
 
FDA approval is required before any “new drug” may be marketed, including new formulations, strengths, dosage forms and generic versions of previously approved drugs. Generally, to obtain FDA approval of a “new drug” a company must file a New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”).
 
Under the OTC monograph system, selected OTC drugs are generally recognized as safe and effective and do not require the submission and approval of a NDA or ANDA prior to marketing.
 
The FDA OTC monographs include well-known ingredients and specify requirements for permitted indications, required warnings and precautions, allowable combinations of ingredients and dosage levels. Drug products marketed under the OTC monograph system must conform to specific quality, formula and labeling requirements; however, these products can be developed and marketed without prior FDA approval unlike products requiring a submission and approval of an ANDA or NDA. In general, it is less costly to develop and bring to market a product regulated under the OTC monograph system. From time to time, adequate information may become available to the FDA regarding certain prescription drug products that will allow the reclassification of those products as no longer requiring the approval of an ANDA or NDA prior to marketing. For this reason, there may be increased competition and lower profitability related to a particular OTC-switch product should it be reclassified to the OTC monograph system.

The FDA and the United States Pharmacopeia Convention (the “USP”) have embarked on an initiative to modernize the monograph requirements of OTC drugs. We are monitoring the situation and will make appropriate adjustments to remain in compliance. In addition, regulations may change from time to time, requiring formulation, packaging or labeling changes for certain products. We cannot predict whether new legislation regulating our activities will be enacted or what effect any legislation would have on our business.
 
Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in product recalls, seizure of products, injunctions, suspension of production and/or distribution, refusal of the government or third parties to enter into contracts with us, withdrawal or suspension of the applicable regulator’s review of our drug applications, civil penalties and criminal fines, and disgorgement of profits.
 
Dietary Supplement Regulation
 
The FDA regulates dietary supplements under a different set of regulations than those covering “conventional” foods and drug products (prescription and OTC). Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (the “DSHEA”), which was passed in 1994, dietary supplements that were in commerce prior to 1994 are broadly presumed safe. For these supplements, manufacturers do not need to register their products with the FDA nor get FDA approval before producing or selling them. Manufacturers must make sure that product label information is truthful and not misleading. For these products, the FDA is responsible for taking action against any unsafe or misbranded dietary supplement product after it reaches the market. All new ingredients marketed within dietary supplements after 1994 that are not found in food must meet a stricter set of regulations and notification prior to release in the marketplace.
 
In June 2007, pursuant to the authority granted by the FFDCA as amended by DSHEA, the FDA published detailed cGMP regulations that govern the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations of dietary supplement manufacturers. The cGMP regulations, among other things, impose significant recordkeeping requirements on manufacturers. The cGMP requirements are in effect for all manufacturers, and the FDA is conducting inspections of dietary supplement manufacturers pursuant to these requirements. The failure of a manufacturing facility to comply with the cGMP regulations renders products manufactured in such facility “adulterated,” and subjects such products and the manufacturer to a variety of potential FDA enforcement actions.
 
In addition, under the Food Safety Modernization Act, (the “FSMA”), which was enacted on January 2, 2011, the manufacturing of dietary ingredients contained in dietary supplements are subject to similar or even more burdensome manufacturing requirements, which has the potential to increase the costs of dietary ingredients and subject suppliers of such ingredients to more rigorous inspections and enforcement. The FSMA requires importers of food, including dietary supplements and dietary ingredients, to conduct verification activities to ensure that the food they might import meets applicable domestic requirements. The FSMA also expands the reach and regulatory powers of the FDA with respect to the production and importation of food, including dietary supplements. The expanded reach and regulatory powers include the FDA’s ability to order mandatory recalls, administratively detain domestic products, require certification of compliance with domestic requirements for imported foods associated with safety issues and administratively revoke manufacturing facility registrations, effectively enjoining manufacturing of dietary ingredients and dietary supplements without judicial process. The regulation of dietary supplements may increase or become more restrictive in the future.
 
Under FFDCA, dietary supplements are subject to both adulteration and misbranding provisions. Adulterated products are those that contain unlisted ingredients or are not prepared or packaged under the FDA cGMPs for dietary supplements and misbranded products are those with false or misleading labels. Adulterated or misbranded products are subject to the full range of civil and criminal enforcement measures under the FFDCA and all violations of FFDCA are subject to criminal enforcement at the FDA’s discretion.
 
We are also subject to the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act, which was passed in 2006 to amend the FFDCA with respect to serious adverse event reporting for dietary supplements and nonprescription drugs, among other things. The law requires that the manufacturer, packer or distributor of a dietary supplement or OTC drug notify the FDA of all serious adverse events it receives associated with their dietary supplement or OTC product within 15 business days. Serious adverse events are defined as those that result in death, a life-threatening experience, in-patient hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly or birth defect, as well as situations where medical/surgical intervention is required to prevent the previously listed events.

Consumer Product Safety Commission
 
Under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (“PPPA”), the CPSC has authority to require that certain dietary supplements and certain pharmaceuticals have child-resistant packaging to help reduce the incidence of accidental poisonings. The CPSC has published regulations requiring iron-containing dietary supplements and various pharmaceuticals to have child resistant packaging, and has established rules for testing the effectiveness of child-resistant packaging and for ensuring senior adult effectiveness.
 
The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (“CPSIA”) amended the Consumer Product Safety Act (“CPSA”) to require that the manufacturer of any product that is subject to any CPSC rule, ban, standard or regulation certify that based on a reasonable testing program the product complies with CPSC requirements. This certification applies to pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements that require child-resistant packaging under the PPPA. The CPSC lifted the stay of enforcement of the certification requirement and the regulation has been in effect since February 9, 2010.
 
Federal Trade Commission
 
Advertising of our products in the United States is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) under the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”). Under the FTC’s Substantiation Doctrine, an advertiser is required to have a “reasonable basis” for all objective product claims before the claims are made. Failure to adequately substantiate claims may be considered either deceptive or unfair practices. Pursuant to this FTC requirement, we are required to have adequate substantiation for all material advertising claims that we make for any products sold in the United States.
 
In recent years, the FTC has initiated numerous investigations of and actions against companies that sell dietary supplements. The FTC has issued guidance to assist companies in understanding and complying with its substantiation requirement. We believe that we have adequate substantiation for all material advertising claims that we make for our products in the United States, and we believe that we have organized the documentation to support our advertising and promotional practices in compliance with these guidelines. However, no assurance can be given that the FTC would reach the same conclusion if it were to review or question our substantiation for our advertising claims in the United States.
 
The FTC may enforce compliance with the law in a variety of ways, both administratively and judicially, using compulsory process, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement can result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, corrective advertising, consumer redress, divestiture of assets, rescission of contracts, and such other relief as the agency deems necessary to protect the public. Violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. Although we have not been the subject of any action by the FTC, no assurance can be given that the FTC will not question our advertising or other operations in the United States in the future. Any action in the future by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products in the United States.
 
Other Regulatory Oversight
 
We are also subject to regulation under various state, local, and international laws that include provisions governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, and distribution of dietary supplements and OTC drugs. For example, Proposition 65 in the state of California is a list of substances deemed to pose a risk of carcinogenicity or birth defects at or above certain levels. If any such ingredient exceeds the permissible levels in a dietary supplement, cosmetic, or drug, the product may be lawfully sold in California only if accompanied by a prominent warning label alerting consumers that the product contains an ingredient linked to cancer or birth defect risk. Private attorney general actions as well as California attorney general actions may be brought against non-compliant parties and can result in substantial costs and fines.

Competition
 
We compete with other contract manufacturers of OTC healthcare products. These suppliers range widely in size. Management believes that our manufacturing capacity and abilities offer a significant advantage over many of our competitors in the full service contract development and manufacturing organization for the OTC healthcare market. We have over 20 years of manufacturing experience and industry know how in large scale batch production of OTC lozenge products. The markets for OTC healthcare products and dietary supplements are highly competitive. Many of the participants in these industries have substantially greater capital resources, technical staffs, facilities, marketing resources, product development, and distribution experience than we do. We believe that our ability to compete in these industries will depend on a number of factors, including product quality and price, availability, speed to market, consumer marketing, reliability, credit terms, brand name recognition, delivery time and post-sale service and support.
Employees
 
At December 31, 2018, we employed 47 full-time employees and 3 part-time employees, the majority of who were employed at our manufacturing facility in a production function. The remaining employees were involved in an executive, sales, marketing or administrative capacity. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are members of a union.
