ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Overview
We are a commercial-stage medical technology company focused on providing innovative soft-tissue reconstruction solutions that optimize clinical outcomes by prioritizing the preservation and restoration of the patient’s own anatomy. Our growing product portfolio is purposefully designed to leverage the patient’s natural healing response while minimizing long-term exposure to permanent synthetic materials. We are committed to delivering our advanced technologies with a strong economic value proposition to assist surgeons and institutions in providing next-generation soft-tissue repair solutions to more patients worldwide. 
We are dedicated to building true partnerships with surgeons and healthcare providers to deliver solutions that provide both clinical and economic improvements. We believe that genuine collaboration with surgeons and healthcare providers results in the development of new solutions that empower patient care. 
Our first portfolio of products, the OviTex Reinforced Tissue Matrix (“OviTex”), which we first commercialized in the U.S. in July 2016, addresses unmet needs in hernia repair and abdominal wall reconstruction by combining the benefits of biologic matrices and polymer materials while minimizing their shortcomings, at a cost-effective price. 
​
Hernia repair is one of the most common surgeries performed in the U.S., representing approximately 1.1 million procedures annually. Based on the volume weighted average selling price of our OviTex products, we estimate the annual U.S. total addressable market opportunity for our OviTex products to be approximately $1.5 billion. 
​
Our OviTex portfolio consists of multiple product configurations intended to address various surgical procedures within hernia repair and abdominal wall reconstruction, including ventral, inguinal, and hiatal hernia repair. In addition, we have also designed an OviTex product specifically for use in laparoscopic and robotic-assisted hernia repair, which we market as OviTex LPR and began commercializing this product in November 2018. We recently launched two new, larger configurations of OviTex LPR, designed for ventral and incisional hernias.
​
We have also focused on evaluating and publishing clinical data on the effectiveness and safety of our OviTex products. To date, there have been thirty published or presented works relating to these clinical findings, either by us or a third-party evaluating the OviTex product. Recently in October 2022, the 24-month results of our single arm, multicenter post-market clinical study, which we refer to as our BRAVO study, were published in the Annals of Medicine and Surgery. The BRAVO study was designed to evaluate the clinical performance of OviTex for primary or recurrent ventral hernias using open, laparoscopic, or robotic techniques in 92 enrolled patients. The recurrence rate at the 24-month time point was 2.6%, and surgical site occurrences (“SSOs”) were observed in 38% of the study population. Of the enrolled patients, 78% were characterized as high risk for experiencing an SSO based on at least one known risk factor, which included obesity, active smoking, COPD, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, or advanced age (≥75 years). The results also indicated that BRAVO patients experienced statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in their quality of life and perceived health based on patient responses to the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) health assessment and the validated 12-question Hernia-Related Quality of Life survey (HerQLes). In addition to the BRAVO study and other current clinical initiatives, we also commenced enrollment in May 2021 for our BRAVO II study, a prospective study evaluating the use of OviTex in robot-assisted ventral and inguinal hernia repairs.
​
Our second portfolio of products, the OviTex PRS Reinforced Tissue Matrix (“OviTex PRS”), which we first commercialized in the U.S. in May 2019, addresses unmet needs in plastic and reconstructive surgery. OviTex PRS is indicated for use in implantation to reinforce soft-tissue where weakness exists in patients requiring soft-tissue repair or reinforcement in plastic and reconstructive surgery. Our OviTex PRS portfolio is supported by non-human primate data that demonstrated more rapid tissue integration and tissue remodeling compared to the market leading biologic matrix used in this indication. Based on the current sales of biologic matrices in the U.S., we estimate the annual U.S. current addressable market opportunity for our OviTex PRS products to be approximately $700 million.

Our OviTex products have received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), which clearance was obtained and is currently held by our exclusive contract manufacturer of these products, Aroa. In April 2019, our OviTex PRS products received 510(k) clearance from the FDA, which clearance was obtained by Aroa and is currently held by us. We have also engaged in discussions with the FDA regarding an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) protocol to study the safety and effectiveness of our OviTex PRS product for an indication in breast reconstruction surgery. The FDA has stated that a PMA, rather than 510(k) clearance will be required for such an indication. We have also commenced a retrospective clinical study evaluating the effectiveness and safety of our OviTex PRS products.
​
We also continue to expand our service offerings and diversify our supplier base as we continue to create a soft tissue restoration portfolio, including through the development of complimentary solutions targeting surgical wound management and infection control. In January 2023, we announced an exclusive development and distribution partnership with Collagen Matrix, Inc. (“CMI”), pursuant to which we launched the commercialization of our NIVIS Fibrillar Collagen Pack, an absorbent matrix of Type I and Type III bovine collagen designed to manage moderately to heavily exudating wounds and to control minor bleeding. We also previously commercialized through a distribution agreement with Next Science Technologies Pty Limited (“Next Science”), a proprietary antimicrobial surgical wash in the U.S. plastic reconstructive market. We are assessing additional strategic partnerships with medical device companies whereby we may enter into distribution, product development and/or licensing agreements for new products complimentary to, or related to, existing and future products in our distribution channel.
​
We have a broad portfolio of intellectual property protecting our products that we believe, when combined with the proprietary manufacturing processes associated with our products and our know-how, provides significant barriers to entry. Our intellectual property applies to our differentiated product construction and materials. In addition, we believe our exclusive manufacturing and long-term supply and license agreement (the “Aroa License”) with Aroa creates a competitive advantage by allowing us to secure an exclusive supply of ovine rumen at a low cost. Ovine rumen, the forestomach of a sheep, is the source of the biologic material used in our OviTex portfolio products. In manufacturing the product, we use biologic material from ovine rumen because of its plentiful supply, optimal biomechanical profile and open collagen architecture that allows for rapid cellular infiltration. We purchase product from Aroa at a fixed cost equal to 27% of our net sales of licensed products.
We market our products through a single direct sales force, predominantly in the U.S., as augmented by a smaller number of sales representatives and distributors in certain European countries. We have invested in our direct sales and marketing infrastructure to expand our presence and to promote awareness and adoption of our products. As of December 31, 2022, we had 67 sales territories in the U.S. As part of our commercial strategy, we plan to continue to invest in our commercial organization by hiring additional territory managers and administrative and field-based support employees to support and service new accounts for soft-tissue reconstruction procedures. We believe we can enhance the productivity of our sales force by improving customer segmentation and targeting, implementing and further refining our proprietary training programs leveraging support from our medical education and clinical development functions to drive physician awareness and education on our products, and utilizing engagement analytics to support product development. Additionally, we have contracted with three national GPOs covering our OviTex portfolio and plan to continue to contract with additional GPOs and other integrated delivery networks (“IDNs”) to increase access to and penetration of hospital accounts. 
Our business was directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We experienced volatility in demand for our products which primarily resulted from government and hospital restrictions, as well as patient health and safety concerns, decreasing the volume of elective procedures using our products. We saw improvement in our business during the second half of 2022 and anticipate that procedure volumes will continue to normalize to pre-pandemic levels; however, we continue to monitor the potential impact of COVID-19 on labor and hospital staffing levels, procedural volumes and ultimately on our financial results. 
Our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $41.4 million and $29.5 million, respectively, which represents an increase of $12.0 million, or 41% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our net loss for the same time periods was $44.3 million and $33.3 million, respectively, which represents an increase of $11.0 million, or 33% for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $274.2 million. The vast 

8



majority of our revenue to date has been generated from sales of our OviTex and OviTex PRS products in the U.S., with the remainder generated from sales of our OviTex products in Europe and the sale of other products.
Market Opportunity
OviTex
Hernia repair is one of the most common surgeries performed in the U.S. There are an estimated 1.1 million hernia repairs annually in the U.S. including recurrences, which we categorize as approximately (i) 60,000 complex/moderate ventral hernia repairs and abdominal wall reconstructions, (ii) 345,000 simple ventral hernia repairs and (iii) 665,000 inguinal hernia repairs, and (iv) 40,000 hiatal hernia repairs. 
The healthcare burden of hernia disease to patients, insurers and employers is significant. For the patient, a hernia may cause an increasing level of pain when lifting, straining during urination or a bowel movement, or sitting or standing for long periods of time. Increased pain from the hernia is the most common reason that a patient who is deferring surgical hernia repair will ultimately elect repair surgery. Following surgical hernia repair, convalescence has a significant socioeconomic impact. Absence from work during this period can range from approximately five to 14 days according to one study. Pain is the most common cause of delay in returning to work, followed by wound problems. Long-term pain or discomfort at the hernia repair site is one of the most serious complications of hernia surgery and may, in some cases, persist for years.
Given the limitations of and lack of innovation in existing hernia repair products, we believe a significant market opportunity exists for our portfolio of OviTex products. Based on the volume weighted average selling price of our OviTex products, we estimate the annual U.S. total addressable market opportunity for our OviTex products to be approximately $1.5 billion.

OviTex PRS
Modern advances in tissue engineering have transformed the plastic and reconstructive surgeon’s management strategies across a wide variety of applications. Because biologic matrices incorporate into host tissues and enable revascularization and functional tissue remodeling, surgeons have realized multiple applications for their use, with techniques tailored to the specific requirements of the surgery. There is growing clinical literature validating the use of biologic matrices in head and neck surgery and reconstructions of the chest wall, pelvic region, extremities and breast.
In head and neck surgery, biologic matrices are used for both aesthetic and reconstructive purposes that include: surgery of the nose to change its shape or improve its function, referred to as rhinoplasty; lip augmentation; repair of perforations of the cartilage and thin bone separating the nostrils referred to as the nasal septum; complex reconstruction of the oral and oropharynx cavities after oncologic resection; cleft palate repair; upper and lower eyelid reconstruction; scalp defects and defects of the fibrous membrane covering the brain and spinal cord referred to as dura. In chest wall

reconstruction, biologic matrices are used to repair defects from oncologic resections. In pelvic reconstruction, biologic matrices are utilized as an adjunct in the reconstruction of acquired pelvic defects caused by resections for colorectal, gynecologic and urologic malignancies. In extremities reconstruction, biologic matrices are used in the upper extremity for repair of the donor site following the harvest of a radial forearm free flap, a procedure used to harvest tissue and replace it in the head and neck after cancer has been resected. In breast reconstruction, biologic matrices are utilized for prosthetic based reconstruction following the removal of cancerous breast tissue.
Based on the current sales of biologic matrices in the U.S., we estimate the annual U.S. current addressable market opportunity for our OviTex PRS products to be approximately $700 million. Given the limitations of and lack of innovation in existing biologic matrices for plastic and reconstructive surgical procedures, we believe a significant market opportunity exists for our OviTex PRS portfolio products.
Current Materials Used in Hernia Repair and Abdominal Wall Reconstruction and Their Limitations
Hernia Repair and Abdominal Wall Reconstruction
The vast majority of hernias are treated with surgical repair. Surgical hernia repair is performed either through open repair, which uses a single incision to open the abdomen or groin across the hernia, or minimally invasive repair, which involves laparoscopic or robotic-assisted techniques. Laparoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive surgical technique performed in the abdomen or groin through small incisions. Surgical instruments and devices, such as mesh products, are then delivered to the surgical site through a trocar, which is an access port to the patient’s abdomen or groin. Robotic-assisted surgery is also performed using small incisions in the patient’s abdomen or groin and a trocar, but the surgeon sits at a console in the operating room and operates the robotic instruments remotely.
At the advent of hernia repair, all procedures were performed using an open surgical technique in which an incision is made through the body to access and repair the hernia. Due to the amount of healthy soft-tissue disruption required for an open procedure, there is a high risk of wound-related complications and seroma formation. In the early 1990s, surgeons began using a laparoscopic approach for hernia repair because it provided the benefits of lower wound complication rates, lower patient morbidity and decreased length of stay for patients. Despite these benefits, laparoscopic surgery presents surgeons with challenges, primarily due to restricted instrument dexterity that makes it difficult to achieve primary closure of the hernia defect, in which the connective tissue layer is sutured close, and leads to a bridged repair. In a bridged repair, the tissue reinforcement material spans a portion of the hernia defect without any connective tissue layer above it to provide additional reinforcement. This leads to increased risk of bulging of the material or hernia recurrence. Robotic-assisted hernia repair addresses this issue while still providing the benefits of a laparoscopic repair. In robotic-assisted repair, the surgeon enjoys greater instrument dexterity and precision, and is able to achieve primary closure of the hernia defect. This has contributed to a significant increase in the number of robotic-assisted hernia repairs over the last several years.
It is estimated that about 90% of hernia repairs today use a form of reconstruction material to provide long-term support at the repair site. Reconstruction materials include synthetic mesh, which can be either permanent or resorbable, and biologic matrices made from tissue material.
In October 2020, we surveyed a group of 71 surgeons to better understand their receptivity to natural repair solutions, their technique preferences across their hernia practice and their views on the risks associated with plastic mesh. Feedback was gathered across inguinal hernia, simple ventral, moderate-to-complex ventral and hiatal hernia repair. Included in the group were 43 general surgeons (61%), 19 plastic reconstructive surgeons (27%) and the remainder were colorectal and trauma surgeons. These surgeons indicated they believe there is a role for natural repair products across all hernia segments and they expect to increase their usage of those products in the next 24 months. Almost 60% of surgeons stated that they are aware of the risks associated with plastic mesh and reported approximately 20% of their hernia patients have voiced concern about the use of plastic mesh within the past 12 months.

Permanent Synthetic Mesh
Permanent synthetic mesh, the oldest category of hernia repair materials, is made of plastic materials that are also used in industrial and consumer products. These products have gained popularity with surgeons because they are relatively inert, can be readily sterilized, exhibit biomechanical strength and durability and are available at relatively low upfront cost. Limitations of permanent synthetic mesh products may include:

● | significant persistent foreign body inflammatory response that can result in encapsulation of the implant by fibrotic tissue or contraction of the mesh;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | chronic post-operative pain;
--+-----------------------------


● | scar tissue formation and lack of regeneration of soft-tissue;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | permanent susceptibility to mesh infection;
--+--------------------------------------------


● | significant cost associated with subsequent repairs or failed and infected mesh;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | compromised abdominal wall anatomy due to damaged and eroded tissue rendering subsequent surgical repairs challenging; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | migration of the permanent synthetic mesh which can result in organ erosion or perforation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many of these complications caused by permanent synthetic mesh require additional surgical intervention, including, explantation of the mesh or repair of hernia recurrence or of the abdominal wall. Based on longitudinal data from the Danish Hernia Database, in an analysis of approximately 2,900 patients who received a hernia repair using a permanent synthetic mesh, the observed rate of surgical intervention due to either recurrence or mesh-related complications at five years post operatively was approximately 17%. As a result of these complications and litigation involving these complications, the number of adverse events reported to the FDA for permanent synthetic mesh hernia repairs has risen from 1,484 in 2016, 3,220 in 2017, 9,887 in 2018 to 18,072 in 2019. Synthetic mesh products have been the subject of an increasing number of lawsuits with over 24,000 cases filed in federal and state courts across the U.S. as of September 2022. 
Biologic Matrices
The complications associated with permanent synthetic mesh prompted the development of biologic matrices as a second category of hernia repair materials. Biologic matrices are derived from human or animal dermis, pericardium or intestinal submucosa, which allows them to become replaced entirely by the patient’s own tissue over time, a process known as remodeling. The goal behind these biologic materials was to lower the foreign body inflammatory response and biomechanical requirements of the repair, while providing a matrix upon which tissue remodeling could occur. Compared to permanent synthetic mesh, biologic matrices are less likely to induce this inflammatory response and become infected; however, they may have the following limitations:

● | lack strength or durability as compared to synthetic mesh products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prone to laxity and stretching;
--+--------------------------------


● | difficult to handle, leading to longer operating times as compared to synthetic mesh products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | inability to be placed in a patient through a trocar in laparoscopic or robotic-assisted surgery; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | considerably more expensive upfront costs than permanent synthetic mesh, typically limiting their use to complex hernia repairs or abdominal wall reconstructions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11



Though hernia recurrence occurs with the use of all types of soft-tissue reconstruction, biologic matrices have the highest rates of recurrence, partly due to common use in complex hernia repairs or abdominal wall reconstructions. The RICH study, a multicenter, prospective study sponsored by LifeCell Corporation (“LifeCell”) that evaluated the performance of Strattice, the industry leader for biological tissue matrices in complex abdominal wall reconstruction, in open ventral incisional hernia repair in contaminated abdominal wall defects, demonstrated post-operative hernia recurrence rates of 19% and 28% at 12-months and 24-months follow-up, respectively.
Resorbable Synthetic Mesh
Resorbable synthetic mesh was introduced as a third category of hernia repair materials and as an alternative to permanent synthetic mesh and biologic matrices. Resorbable synthetic mesh was designed with the intended benefits of full degradation over several months, a moderately lower cost than biologic matrices and gradual transfer of strength from synthetic mesh to native tissue over time. Resorbable synthetic mesh is polymer-based and does not include biologic material to promote tissue remodeling and healing. Despite improvements compared to the use of permanent synthetic mesh or biologic matrices, limitations of resorbable synthetic mesh may include:

● | significant foreign body inflammatory response that can result in encapsulation or contraction of the mesh until resorbed;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | scar tissue formation and lack of remodeling of soft-tissue;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | mesh infection until resorbed;
--+-------------------------------


● | migration of the mesh until resorbed which can result in organ erosion or perforation; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | lack of mid-term and long-term soft-tissue reinforcement as resorption progresses.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many of these complications can require additional surgical intervention including explantation of the resorbable synthetic mesh or repair of hernia recurrence or the abdominal wall. Data from a published, multicenter, prospective study sponsored by C.R. Bard, Inc. (now a subsidiary of Becton, Dickinson and Company) that evaluated the performance of Phasix, the current market-leading resorbable synthetic mesh, in CDC Class I, high risk ventral and incisional hernia repair, showed a post-operative hernia recurrence rate of 9% at 18-months follow-up and 18% at 36-month follow-up.
Current Materials Used in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and Their Limitations
Biologic matrices are most commonly used in plastic and reconstructive surgery, including surgery of the nose to change its shape or improve its function, referred to as rhinoplasty, lip augmentation, repair of perforations of cartilage and thin bone separating the nostrils, complex reconstruction of the oral and oropharynx cavities after oncologic resection, cleft palate repair, upper and lower eyelid reconstruction, scalp defects, and defects of the fibrous membrane covering the brain and spinal cord, called the dura, because of their ability to define shape and position, improve tissue quality, reinforce existing soft-tissue and reduce the rate of complications associated with a foreign body inflammatory response, however they are prone to excessive stretching over time and difficult for surgeons to handle. These limitations may lead to undesirable results requiring additional surgical intervention. Additionally, biologic matrices are typically expensive to source.
Our Solution
We have created a new category of tissue reinforcement materials that were purposefully designed in close collaboration with more than 100 surgeons to address the unmet clinical needs in soft-tissue reconstruction. Our portfolio of products, designed with over 95% biologic material, combines the benefits of both biologic and polymer materials while addressing their limitations by interweaving polymer fibers through layers of a minimally-processed biologic material. These products are priced competitively and designed for use with a range of surgical techniques, allowing the benefits 

12



of an advanced biologic repair to be available to more patients for use in accordance with the products’ 510(k) clearances and instructions for use.
The biologic material serves as the natural building block from which we can fabricate devices that meet specific clinical and surgical handling requirements. This material consists of an intact, minimally-processed extracellular matrix derived from ovine rumen, which is the forestomach of a sheep. Polymer fibers are interwoven through the layers of biologic material in unique embroidered patterns and contribute to approximately 5% of the overall device by mass. The interwoven polymer utilized can be either permanent, made from polypropylene, or resorbable, made from polyglycolic acid (“PGA”). The embroidering pattern varies between our OviTex and OviTex PRS portfolios to impart different biomechanical properties tailored for their respective intended clinical applications. Our OviTex products are designed with a lockstitch embroidery pattern that is sewn in a grid pattern to create a ripstop effect and minimize unraveling (when cut). Our OviTex PRS products are designed with a patented corner-lock stitch pattern designed to resist deformation and to control the degree and direction of stretching of the product.
Our capabilities in polymer science, biologics, textile engineering and analytical testing enable us to quickly design innovative products for development and manufacture. These competencies also allow our technical team to tailor the degree of stretch, direction of stretch, overall strength, handling properties, permeability, thickness, texture, size and shape of each reinforced tissue matrix to suit the needs of particular clinical applications and surgical techniques. This expertise has been utilized in the development of our OviTex and OviTex PRS products and is currently being leveraged in the development of our additional OviTex product pipeline seeking to enhance product features for various applications within our indications.
Our reinforced tissue matrices are designed to improve the outcomes of soft-tissue reconstructions by reinforcing tissue while allowing rapid tissue integration, revascularization and biomechanical control. In addition to overall strength, a key property that we engineer into our products is the degree to which they stretch, known as compliance. Each of our products is designed to exhibit a degree of compliance appropriate for its intended clinical application.
The graphics below illustrate the key features of our OviTex and OviTex PRS products:

We believe the principal benefits of our reinforced tissue matrices are:

● | Reduced foreign body inflammatory response. The biologic material utilized in our reinforced tissue matrices is designed to minimize the body’s inflammatory response to the device. Our unique embroidered patterns create a macroporous grid within the biologic material. In our non-human primate study in which we compared our OviTex products to several commercially available synthetic mesh and biologic matrix products, at 24 weeks, our OviTex products demonstrated a minimal foreign body inflammatory response similar to that of biologic matrices, and less foreign body inflammatory response than all of the synthetic mesh tested.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhanced remodeling of soft-tissue and rate of healing. Our reinforced tissue matrices are constructed to provide increased surface area and permeability, allowing for rapid absorption of wound fluids and blood during implantation and enabling oxygen supply, cellular infiltration, migration, and repopulation for revascularization and functional tissue remodeling during healing. In our non-human primate comparative study, at 24 weeks the pattern of collagen formation in our OviTex products resembled connective tissue as opposed to the random fibers typical of scar tissue that were seen adjacent to the synthetic mesh. By contrast, the synthetic mesh showed no signs of remodeling of soft-tissue and exhibited a high level of mesh contraction.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Highly engineered biomechanical properties supported by clinical evidence. Our reinforced tissue matrices are reinforced with interwoven polymer fibers to provide mid-term and long-term support. The interwoven polymer increases the strength of our OviTex products by approximately 25% compared to the biologic material alone. When tensile forces are applied, this design allows for load sharing between the biologic material and the polymer during the remodeling process. Data from our strength testing demonstrated that our OviTex products meet or exceed that of published data from market-leading permanent and resorbable synthetic mesh. In our BRAVO study, the recurrence rate at the 24-month time point was 2.6%, and SSOs were observed in 38% of the study population. Of the enrolled patients, 78%
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14




were characterized as high risk for experiencing an SSO based on at least one known risk factor, which included obesity, active smoking, COPD, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, or advanced age (≥75 years). Based on this data, we believe that this recurrence rate is the lowest reported rate in any published study, including our biologic or resorbable synthetic mesh competitors. The addition of polymer to our reinforced tissue matrices allows each product to maintain its physiologic compliance properties, while resisting stretching and elongation. In our non-human primate comparative study, our OviTex devices best preserved their original shape, experiencing less contraction compared to biologic and synthetic mesh.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhanced surgeon handling and satisfaction. Each of our embroidery patterns was designed specifically to allow the surgeon to trim and shape the product while minimizing the potential for unraveling of the polymer. Based upon our survey of approximately 50 surgeons, our OviTex products conform readily to the contours of surgical sites and are easy to handle, trim, suture and tack in all surgical approaches. In addition, in our BRAVO study, 32 of the 92 enrolled subjects received minimally invasive surgery, of whom 12 received laparoscopic repair and 20 received robotic repair. Of the surgeons who performed minimally invasive surgery, all reported at the time of surgery that the product was easy or very easy to place. The average surgeon satisfaction with the product was 9.7/10 at 30 days for the minimally invasive cohort and remained consistent over 24 months of follow-up. We are also actively enrolling patients in our BRAVO II study, a prospective study evaluating robot-assisted ventral and inguinal hernia repairs with OviTex, including our OviTex LPR, OviTex Core Permanent and OviTex 1S Permanent configurations. During the fourth quarter of 2022, 40% of reported cases using OviTex were performed robotically and 20% were completed laparoscopically, showing growing use of our OviTex product in these minimally invasive settings.

● | Lower upfront cost products. Our reinforced tissue matrices provide our customers with meaningful cost savings over leading competitive products across a range of clinical uses so that more patients can experience the benefits of an advanced biologic repair solution. We price our OviTex products competitively, and on average, our customers realize 20% to 40% cost savings over leading biologic matrices and resorbable synthetic mesh. Our OviTex PRS portfolio is priced below leading biologic matrices.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strengths
We are focused on developing and commercializing a new category of tissue reinforcement materials for surgeons and patients that aim to address the shortcomings of existing products. We believe the following strengths will allow us to build our business and potentially increase our market penetration:

● | Innovative and broad portfolio of products. Our OviTex and OviTex PRS products are the only FDA-cleared products to incorporate polymer fibers interwoven through layers of biologic material in a lockstitch pattern creating an embroidered construction. The biologic matrix is derived from ovine rumen and utilizes a patented process to create a reinforced tissue matrix that is optimized for soft-tissue reconstruction. Our OviTex and OviTex PRS products are available in resorbable and permanent polymer versions in a variety of configurations and sizes. For example, our OviTex devices are currently available in sizes ranging from 4 × 8 cm to 25 × 40 cm, and our OviTex LPR devices are designed with specific thickness, handling properties and shapes optimized for use in laparoscopic and robotic-assisted surgery.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Disruptive technology supported by compelling pre-clinical and clinical evidence. OviTex product technology is supported by extensive pre-clinical research, including bench testing, in-vitro and in-vivo studies. These studies have demonstrated appropriate physiologic strength for the repair, compliance within the physiologic range of the human abdominal wall, retention of extracellular matrix proteins which may aid in tissue remodeling and porosity and permeability to promote fluid transfer. Our in-vivo non-human primate data demonstrated that use of our OviTex products resulted in more rapid tissue integration and revascularization compared to pure biologic matrices, as well as lower inflammatory response and better functional tissue remodeling compared to permanent and resorbable synthetic mesh. This preclinical data is
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15




supported by our compelling clinical evidence showing the safety and efficacy of our OviTex products in published data on over 1,000 hernia patients.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Long-term supply agreement that provides pricing flexibility. Our Aroa License provides for the exclusive supply of ovine rumen and manufacture of our OviTex and OviTex PRS products, which gives us a low and fixed cost of raw materials. We purchase product from Aroa at a fixed cost equal to 27% of our net sales of licensed products.

● | Potential cost savings to healthcare systems and hospitals. Our pricing flexibility allows us to sell our OviTex and OviTex PRS products to hospitals and healthcare systems at prices substantially below competitive products based on national average competitive pricing. Our OviTex products are sold at prices approximately 20% to 40% lower than other biologic matrices and resorbable synthetic mesh. We believe our pricing flexibility will continue to drive greater adoption of our products. Our OviTex PRS products are priced below leading biologic matrices, and as we further commercialize our OviTex PRS portfolio, we anticipate that our customers will realize cost savings over biologic matrices based on national average competitive pricing. We believe that the average selling prices across our products will provide financial benefits to our customers in addition to improving clinical outcomes.

● | Established reimbursement pathway for hernia repair. The implantation of biologic matrices and synthetic mesh for hernia repair is coded using an established fixed procedure payment system known as a MS-DRG that consists of a lump sum payment rate that varies based on the degree of complications and comorbidities of each hernia. In addition, surgeons receive payment for their services depending on the coding associated with the procedure. The MS-DRG-based reimbursement system encourages hospitals to become more efficient in treating patients due to its fixed per-patient reimbursement nature.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Broad intellectual property portfolio. Our products are covered by intellectual property that broadly covers changing a biologic matrix’s biomechanical properties by interweaving a polymer thread through the biologic matrix. Specifically, our patents claim the ability to tailor stretch resistance. The ability to predictably control the biomechanical properties of a biologic matrix is the cornerstone of our product portfolio. Our intellectual property also covers the development of extracellular matrix scaffolds derived from ovine rumen, methods for isolating these scaffolds from ovine rumen, layering multiple sheets of these ovine rumen scaffolds together, sewing in an anti-adhesive layer into a scaffold, and adding unique patterns sewn or embroidered into these scaffolds using different polymers to impart reinforcing strength. Our portfolio also includes patents covering implants with gripping strands, and implants with multivesicular liposomes that may be used to deliver drugs. Through the Aroa License and our issued or allowed patents and patent applications, we have a broad portfolio of intellectual property that is leveraged in all of our reinforced tissue matrix products. In addition, we believe that the trade secrets developed with Aroa create additional barriers to entry.

Our Growth Strategy
Our goal is to become the leading provider of soft-tissue reconstruction products. The key elements of our strategy include:

● | Expand our U.S. commercial organization to support our growth. We sell our products through a single direct sales organization in the U.S. As of December 31, 2022, we had 67 sales territories in the U.S. which are supported by 123 employees in our U.S. based commercial organization. We plan to continue to invest in our commercial organization by hiring additional territory managers and administrative and field-based support employees to support and service new accounts for soft-tissue reconstruction procedures. We believe we can also enhance the productivity of our sales force by improving customer segmentation and targeting, implementing and further refining our proprietary training programs, leveraging support from our medical education and clinical development functions to drive physician awareness and education on our products, and utilizing engagement analytics to support product development.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Promote awareness of our products to drive surgeon use. We educate surgeons regarding the value proposition of our products through presentations and exhibits at industry conferences, medical education symposia, direct training and education, webinars and publishing additional clinical data demonstrating the benefits of our products and establishing online peer-to-peer communities. We plan to continue to drive awareness of our products through in-person and virtual versions of these programs, while expanding their geographic reach and increasing the number of surgeon interactions. We will continue to increase our digital marketing efforts as well to build brand awareness with event marketing engagement, targeted ads and emails, various social media efforts and patient education and outreach efforts.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Drive utilization through existing GPO and IDN contracts and secure additional contracts. We are focused on partnering with our existing GPO- and IDN-contracted customers to promote implementation of our contracts, increase our access to surgeon customers, broaden awareness of products and help drive utilization of our products within associated hospitals and healthcare systems. To date, we have contracted with three national GPOs covering our OviTex and OviTex PRS products. In addition, we continue to pursue contracts with additional GPOs and IDNs. GPO and IDN contracts enable greater access to geographies with high procedural volumes and provide prioritized status within hospital procurement systems.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to build upon clinical evidence of the effectiveness and safety of our products. We are committed to evidence-based medicine and investing in clinical data to support the use of our products. In our BRAVO study, the recurrence rate at the 24-month time point was 2.6%, and SSOs were observed in 38% of the study population. 78% of all enrolled patients were characterized as high risk for experiencing an SSO based on at least one known risk factor, which included obesity, active smoking, COPD, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, or advanced age (≥75 years). Our analysis of patients in the BRAVO study reaching 24-month follow-up was published in the Annals of Medicine and Surgery in October 2022. We have begun our next post-market prospective study, BRAVO II, which evaluates OviTex LPR, OviTex Core Permanent and OviTex 1S Permanent in the robotic repair of ventral and inguinal hernias over 24 months.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advance our portfolio of reinforced tissue matrices with the introduction of new product features and designs. We plan to continue to expand our product offerings and the treatment capabilities of our products to address a broader patient base within soft-tissue reconstruction. As we innovate and develop our products, the new features and improved surgical techniques expand the clinical applications for soft-tissue reinforcement. Areas of focus include enhanced surgical handling, increased permeability, and longer-acting resorbable polymers. Improving the surgical handling and implementation of our devices benefits both the clinician and patient. Increasing product permeability encourages a more-natural healing response. Longer-acting polymers can provide additional support for patients that need more time to heal. We believe these technology enhancements will continue to bolster our portfolio and expand the successful use of our products.

● | Expand our service offerings and diversify our supplier base to create a broader soft tissue preservation and restoration portfolio. We plan to continue assessing internal development strategies and strategic partnerships with medical device companies whereby we may enter into distribution, product development and/or licensing agreements for new soft tissue preservation and restoration products complimentary to, or related to, existing and future products in our distribution channel. For example, in January 2023, we announced the commercial launch of our NIVIS Fibrillar Collagen Pack, an absorbent matrix of Type I and Type III bovine collagen designed to manage moderately to heavily exudating wounds and to control minor bleeding. Similarly, we continue to evaluate additional product opportunities that address patient health and unmet needs within the indications in which we operate.

Our Products
Our Technology Platform
Our advanced reinforced tissue matrix technology consists of multiple layers of minimally-processed, decellularized extracellular matrix derived from ovine rumen with interwoven polymer fibers in a unique embroidered pattern. The extracellular matrix is the collagen component of the rumen that is retained following removal of the epithelium, muscle and cellular content, and has an optimal biomechanical profile and open collagen architecture that allows for rapid cellular infiltration. These thin, strong layers of ovine rumen are plentiful in supply and serve as building blocks from which we can construct multilayered devices to customize products to adapt to clinical needs and surgeon preferences. The layers of extracellular matrix provide a high degree of surface area for tissue remodeling. We strengthen these reinforced tissue matrix layers with interwoven polymers, that are either permanent (polypropylene), or resorbable (PGA). These polymers were selected because they are well characterized suture materials with a history of significant clinical use and recognized safety profiles. Polypropylene has a high tensile strength and a low inflammatory response in small quantities. PGA is the fastest resorbing polymer and within three months it tends to be fully absorbed into the body.
Our highly specialized and customizable textile engineering capability allows us to tailor the degree and direction of stretch, overall strength, handling properties, permeability, thickness, texture, size and shape of each reinforced tissue matrix to suit the needs of particular clinical applications and surgical techniques. Our textile engineering utilizes a computer-controlled fabrication method that is scalable, reproducible, efficient and customizable. This embroidery process creates hundreds of micro-channels to allow the multi-directional passage of the patients’ native cells and fluids throughout the product. The interwoven polymers are embroidered using a lockstitch pattern, which allows for the device to be trimmed while minimizing unraveling (when cut), and we use a patented corner-lock pattern, which creates a stable polymer fabric within the biologic material. We manipulate the polymer thread patterns to control the degree and stretch of our products. Denser grid patterns increase the amount of reinforcement and less dense patterns of different geometry allow for greater stretch. We are also able to manufacture products with smooth external layers that minimize the amount of exposed polymer such that the product can be placed in contact with the viscera. 
OviTex Reinforced Tissue Matrix
Our OviTex Reinforced Tissue Matrix has received 510(k) clearance from the FDA, which clearance was obtained and is currently held by Aroa and is intended for use as a surgical mesh to reinforce and/or repair soft-tissue where weakness exists. Indications for use include the repair of hernias and/or abdominal wall defects that require the use of reinforcing or bridging material to obtain the desired surgical outcome. Our OviTex products can be used in a variety of hernia repairs, including simple and complex ventral, inguinal and hiatal hernias, as well as abdominal wall reconstructions.
Our OviTex products are sterile reinforced tissue matrices derived from ovine rumen with either polypropylene or PGA. The product is provided in a dry, hydratable form and packaged in a double pouched configuration. The product can be stored at room temperature and only needs five minutes of rehydration for use. To be used in surgery our OviTex product is placed in a sterile dish, rehydrated with sterile saline for five minutes, trimmed to fit the site, if needed, and then positioned to achieve maximum contact between the device and the surrounding tissue. The device may be sutured, stapled or tacked into place.

18



All of our OviTex products were designed to minimize the amount of polymer material implanted in patients. The synthetic material in our OviTex products comprise less than 5% of our final product. Depending on the configuration selected, the amount of polymer is approximately 75% less than the polymer content of the most widely implanted permanent synthetic mesh, thereby reducing the patient’s foreign body inflammatory response to the polymer.
We market a variety of OviTex products in a range of sizes, thicknesses and degrees of reinforcement in order to suit surgeon preference and desired surgical technique. Our OviTex portfolio is designed to allow surgeons to select a device appropriate for any abdominal tissue plane. Generally, surgeons may place the reinforced tissue matrix in direct contact with internal organs, known as intraperitoneal placement, or away from these internal organs in a variety of tissue planes, known as pre-peritoneal placement. When selecting a product for intraperitoneal placement, surgeons require a surface that minimizes the risk of tissue attachment, whereas when selecting a product for pre-peritoneal placement, surgeons are able to use a product with polymer exposure on both sides. Surgeons may select the most appropriate product from our OviTex portfolio based on the size of the defect, necessity or surgeon preference for internal organ contact, use of a minimally invasive or open surgical technique and risk of infection.
OviTex Laparoscopic and Robotic Procedures
Our OviTex LPR product was specifically designed for use in laparoscopic and robotic-assisted hernia surgical repairs. OviTex LPR was designed for use with a trocar and requires the same rehydration and fixation as our other OviTex products. This product includes design elements to improve surgical handling, including two extra embroidered lines of blue colored polypropylene fibers to enhance endoscopic orientation and alignment. This product can be introduced into the patient’s body through various sized trocar ports. Based on surgeon feedback, OviTex LPR was designed in an elliptical or circular shape to minimize trimming.

OviTex Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery — OviTex PRS
OviTex PRS, has received 510(k) clearance from the FDA, which clearance was obtained by Aroa and is held by us, and is indicated for use in implantation to reinforce soft-tissue where weakness exists in patients requiring soft-tissue repair or reinforcement in plastic and reconstructive surgery. Our OviTex PRS product can be stored at room temperature and comes in the same packaging and requires the same rehydration and fixation as our OviTex products.
Our OviTex PRS product is a sterile reconstructive reinforced tissue matrix composed of three layers of ovine rumen joined by a patented corner-lock embroidered diamond patterned polymer (PGA or polypropylene) that allows the product to stretch while also maintaining its shape. Machine punched regularly spaced fenestrations, or holes, and die-cut slits in the product facilitate fluid management, allow for rapid cellular infiltration and create a directional bias to the stretch. Our OviTex PRS product is available in arced rectangle and half-moon shapes in a range of sizes (4 × 16 cm through 20 × 20 cm) to suit surgeon preference and nature of the soft-tissue repair in plastic and reconstructive surgery. The device may be trimmed to a desired shape to further accommodate individual anatomy. The current shelf life of permanent OviTex PRS is 36 months and the current shelf life of resorbable OviTex PRS is 12 months.

Product Pipeline and Research and Development
We continue to advance our product pipeline to broaden our treatment capabilities for soft-tissue reinforcement. As we innovate and develop our products, the new features and improved surgical techniques expand the clinical applications for soft-tissue reinforcement. Areas of focus include enhanced surgical handling, increased permeability, and longer-acting resorbable polymers. Improving the surgical handling and implementation of our devices benefits both the clinician and patient. Increasing product permeability encourages a more-natural healing response. Longer-acting polymers can provide additional support for patients that need more time to heal. We believe these technology enhancements will continue to bolster our portfolio and expand the successful use of our products.
Scientific Evidence
Overview of Preclinical and Clinical Programs
One of our key strategies is to continuously obtain evidence to support the safety and effectiveness of our products, which we believe will differentiate us from our competitors. As part of our strategy to gather and analyze high-quality data, we seek to ensure rigorous and reliable data collection and reporting. The data from our preclinical and clinical studies strengthens our ability to raise surgeon awareness and drive adoption of our products as a new category of soft-tissue reconstruction products. We expect our clinical evidence will provide surgeons with safety and efficacy data on 

20



the appropriate use of our products and we plan to obtain further clinical evidence to support additional regulatory clearances or approvals of our reinforced tissue matrices for additional indications for use in the future.
Preclinical Program
Our pre-clinical program is paramount in the design of our products. Our program starts with bench performance characterization to ensure proper strength and compliance for the indication, followed by in-vitro and in-vivo studies to ensure proper biological performance to help promote remodeling of the repair site. We have developed an extensive pre-clinical research library on our devices, as well as on competitor devices. We continue to evaluate new and existing technologies for safety and biocompatibility as part of our product development process. 
We believe we have completed the largest collection of non-human primate preclinical studies conducted in soft-tissue reconstruction surgery. In these studies, we compared our OviTex and OviTex PRS products to market leading competitive materials. The results showed our reinforced tissue matrices exhibited a minimal inflammatory response, rapid cellular infiltration and revascularization and demonstrated early and complete remodeling into functional tissue. The OviTex results have been published in the peer-reviewed journal Hernia (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-019-02119-z). The OviTex PRS results have been published in the peer-reviewed journal ePlasty (ePlasty 2022;22:e43).
Clinical Program
We are committed to obtaining evidence to support the safety and efficacy of our products across their indications. Clinical data has been published on over 1,000 patients treated with OviTex in ventral hernia, inguinal hernia, hiatal hernia, and abdominal wall reconstruction. As part of our clinical research program, we have developed two post-market studies, BRAVO and BRAVO II. This commitment to generating clinical data through controlled prospective studies with 24-month follow-up will allow us to understand the short- and long-term benefits of using OviTex in hernia repair.
In October 2022, the 24-month results of our BRAVO study were published in the Annals of Medicine and Surgery. The BRAVO study was designed to evaluate the clinical performance of OviTex for primary or recurrent ventral hernias using open, laparoscopic, or robotic techniques in 92 enrolled patients. The recurrence rate at the 24-month time point was 2.6%, and SSOs were observed in 38% of the study population. 78% of all enrolled patients were characterized as high risk for experiencing an SSO based on at least one known risk factor, which included obesity, active smoking, COPD, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, or advanced age (≥75 years). The results also indicated that BRAVO patients experienced statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in their quality of life and perceived health.
Surgeons continue to use our OviTex PRS reinforced tissue matrices in their surgeries and, in addition to a potential IDE study, we have also commenced a retrospective clinical study evaluating the effectiveness and safety of our OviTex PRS products.
​
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent and trademark rights, preserving the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operating without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect the intellectual property rights that we consider important to our business. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Aroa License
In August 2012, we entered into the Aroa License, which was amended and restated in July 2015, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive license to certain patents and know-how to develop, commercialize and sell bovine and ovine extracellular matrix products for hernia repair, abdominal wall and breast reconstruction in North America and Europe, 

21



which we refer to as the Licensed Territory. In addition, under the Aroa License, Aroa is our exclusive manufacturer and supplier for the development of our bovine and ovine extracellular matrix products. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Aroa License, we made upfront payments to Aroa totaling $2.3 million and granted Aroa 74,316 newly issued shares of our restricted common stock. We have made additional payments in the aggregate of $2.0 million to Aroa following the achievement of certain regulatory and operational milestones, including FDA 510(k) clearance of our OviTex products, which clearance was obtained and is currently held by Aroa, for use in surgical soft-tissue reinforcement and the receipt of the first CE mark for sale of our products in the European Economic Area for use in abdominal wall reconstruction and hernia repair and our acceptance of certain supply quantities manufactured by Aroa for our commercial launch in Europe. In addition, we paid Aroa $4.0 million in revenue-based milestone payments upon our achievement of certain net sales thresholds for sales of our products within the Licensed Territory. As of December 31, 2022, we have satisfied all milestone payment obligations under the Aroa License.
We are responsible for commercializing the products manufactured for us by Aroa. We pay Aroa for the supply and manufacturing of our products through a revenue sharing agreement. Pursuant to the Aroa License, we retain 73% of the net sales of all of our products and pay Aroa the remaining 27%. If at any point during the term of the Aroa License we and Aroa determine that our anticipated product needs exceed Aroa’s manufacturing capabilities, we and Aroa will mutually approve an expansion and equally share the cost of such expansion. Our share of such expansion costs may be offset by us against future revenue share payments.
The initial term of the Aroa License terminates on the expiration of the last patent covering the OviTex and OviTex PRS products, currently March 9, 2031, with an option to extend for an additional ten-year period. Either party may terminate the Aroa License upon the other party’s material breach, subject to a ninety-day notice and cure period or upon thirty-days written notice in the event of bankruptcy. We may terminate manufacture and production of a specific product upon thirty-days prior written notice upon (i) a reasonable determination that such product infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party, (ii) an uncured supply failure by Aroa or (iii) such product proves unfeasible, and immediately upon written notice from a regulatory authority that such product must be withdrawn from the market. If we materially breach the Aroa License in one of the Licensed Territories, Aroa may terminate the Aroa License solely with respect to the Licensed Territory in which the breach occurred. Upon termination of the Aroa License, we have the right to purchase all or any part of the unsold portion of any completed products from Aroa and the right to continue to sell all products remaining in our inventory.
The Aroa License also contains customary representations and warranties, confidentiality, insurance, audit, indemnification and non-competition provisions.
Patents
As of December 31, 2022, we exclusively license two issued U.S. patents that will expire in 2029 and 2031. We own fifteen U.S. issued or allowed patents which will expire between 2035 and 2038 and nine pending U.S. patent applications, which subject to issuance, are projected to expire between 2035 and 2042, without taking into account potential patent term extensions or adjustments. In addition to our U.S. intellectual property, we also own three issued non-U.S. patents and four pending non-U.S. patent applications, which, subject to issuance, would be projected to expire between 2036 and 2037 and have exclusively licensed issued patents in Europe and Canada that will expire in 2029.
Our patents and patent applications cover, among other things, our corner-lock embroidery pattern, the use of adhesion barriers sewn into soft-tissue and compliance associated with stretching.
Although the term of individual patents varies depending upon the country in which they were granted, in most countries, including the U.S., the patent term is 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the U.S., a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date.

22



We cannot be sure that our pending patent applications that we have filed or may file in the future will result in issued patents, and we can give no assurance that any patents that have been issued or might issue in the future will protect our current or future products, will provide us with any competitive advantage, and will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented.
Trade Secrets
We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to our proprietary information. However, trade secrets and proprietary information can be difficult to protect. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets and proprietary information, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets and proprietary information may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.
Trademarks
We also rely on trademarks and trade designs to develop and maintain our competitive position. TELA Bio®, OviTex®, Minimize the Foreign Body Footprint®, and A More Natural Hernia Repair® are registered trademarks of ours in the U.S. and TELA Bio® and OviTex® are registered trademarks in the foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.
For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see the section titled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Intellectual Property Matters.”
Research and Development
We invest in research and development to advance our reinforced tissue matrix products and to develop complimentary soft tissue preservation and restoration products, with the goal of improving upon and supplementing our existing product offerings. We believe our ability to rapidly develop new products and product configurations is attributable to the dynamic product innovation process that we have implemented, the versatility and leveragability of our core technology and the management philosophy behind that process. We have recruited and retained engineers and scientists with significant experience in the development of polymer science, biologics, textile engineering and analytical testing. We have a number of design improvements for our reinforced tissue matrices in various stages of development that are expected to enhance our current products and increase surgeon adoption of our products. In addition, we have engaged in discussions with the FDA regarding an IDE protocol to study the safety and effectiveness of our OviTex PRS portfolio for an indication in breast reconstruction surgery. The FDA has stated that a PMA, rather than 510(k) clearance, will be required for such an indication. Our research and development efforts are based at our facility in Malvern, Pennsylvania.
Commercial Strategy
Our commercial efforts are predominantly focused on the U.S. market where we have established strong relationships with key constituencies, including hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, GPOs, IDN, third-party payors and other key clinical and economic decision makers by offering a unique high quality, cost-effective product. As part of our overall commercial strategy, we intend to contract with GPOs and IDNs to increase access and penetration with hospital accounts. To date, we have contracted with three national GPOs for coverage of our OviTex and OviTex PRS products. We have invested in our direct sales and marketing infrastructure in order to expand our presence to promote awareness and adoption of our products. 
We market our products to hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, surgeons, GPOs, IDNs and medical device supply chain participants primarily through our direct sales force. Our sales representatives and sales managers have substantial medical device experience. As of December 31, 2022, we had 123 employees in our U.S. based commercial organization in 67 sales territories, which includes sales management, territory managers, marketing and administrative and field-based support staff. We plan to continue to invest in our commercial organization by hiring additional territory managers and administrative and field-based support employees to support and service new accounts for soft-tissue reconstruction procedures.

Manufacturing
All our raw materials are sourced through and manufactured by Aroa in their Auckland, New Zealand facility under the terms of the Aroa License. Aroa’s facility is approximately 40,000 square feet of which approximately 25,000 square feet is dedicated to manufacturing, including an additional 15,000 square feet of additional manufacturing space in a neighboring facility. The Auckland facility is FDA registered and ISO 13485 certified. We believe that Aroa will be capable of providing sufficient quantities of our products to meet anticipated customer demands. In the event of an uncured supply failure by Aroa, we have the right to, directly or through a third-party, step in and operate the Aroa Auckland facility to manufacture our products on behalf of Aroa.
The proprietary ovine rumen used in the manufacturing of our products is obtained from sheep raised for human consumption in New Zealand and is currently sourced by Aroa from two abattoirs, or slaughterhouses. Although only two abattoirs are currently used, there are more than 30 additional abattoirs in New Zealand that could be used to source the ovine rumen. New Zealand cattle and sheep are considered by the USDA to be free of prion disease (progressive neurodegenerative disorders, including scrapie). The sheep receive veterinary inspection prior to slaughter and then each carcass is inspected post-mortem for the presence of disease according to USDA approved standards. Only sheep which pass full inspection can be used as a raw tissue source for our products and all the ovine rumen is processed in compliance with the FDA’s regulations for Medical Devices Containing Materials Derived from Animal Sources. Once the ovine rumen is procured, our reinforced tissue matrix products are then manufactured by Aroa at its facility in Auckland, New Zealand.
Distribution
The majority of our products are shipped directly from Auckland, New Zealand to our headquarters in Malvern, Pennsylvania. We sell our products directly to our customers, which are hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers. Except for our stocking distributors in Europe, we do not use distributors to sell our products.
Competition
The medical device industry is intensely competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants.
In the hernia repair market, our primary competitors are Bard, a subsidiary of Becton, Dickinson and Company, which produces Phasix and Ventralight ST, and LifeCell, a subsidiary of AbbVie, which produces Strattice. In the plastic and reconstructive surgery market, our primary competitor is LifeCell, a subsidiary of AbbVie, which produces AlloDerm.
Many of these competitors are large, well-capitalized companies with significantly greater market share and resources than we have, selling products that have been on the market prior to the commercialization of our products. As a consequence, they are able to spend more on product development, marketing, sales and other product initiatives than we can, while also benefiting from greater brand awareness. We also compete with smaller medical device companies that have single products or a limited range of products. Some of our competitors have:

● | significantly greater name recognition;
--+----------------------------------------


● | broader or deeper relations with healthcare professionals, customers and third-party payors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | more established distribution networks;
--+----------------------------------------


● | greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, marketing and obtaining regulatory clearance or approval for products; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing and patent prosecution.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

24



We believe that our continued ability to compete favorably depends on:

● | successfully expanding our commercial operations;
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | continuing to innovate and maintain scientifically-advanced technology;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | attracting and retaining skilled personnel;
--+--------------------------------------------


● | maintaining and obtaining intellectual property protection for our products; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | conducting clinical studies and obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals.

Government Regulation
Our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state and local authorities, as well as foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, design, manufacturing, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of medical devices in the U.S. to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical products for their intended use. The Federal Trade Commission also regulates the advertising of our products in the U.S. Further, we are subject to laws directed at preventing fraud and abuse, which subject our sales and marketing, training and other practices to government scrutiny.
Regulatory System for Medical Devices in the U.S.
All of our medical devices sold in the U.S. are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) as implemented and enforced by the FDA.
Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a PMA application. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be resource intensive, expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available.
Device Classification
Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes — Class I, Class II or Class III — depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness.
Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of FDA regulations, referred to as the General Controls for Medical Devices, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality Systems Regulations, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices, also called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.
Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, patient registries, FDA guidance documents and post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process.

25



Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed novel and not substantially equivalent to a medical device cleared through the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and special controls described above. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA application process, which is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. Through the PMA application process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA’s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, preclinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA’s satisfaction a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.
510(k) Clearance Pathway
Our current products are subject to premarket notification and clearance under section 510(k) of the FDCA.
When a 510(k) clearance is required, we must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that our proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, which is a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. By regulation, a premarket notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 90 days before we intend to distribute a device. As a practical matter, clearance often takes nine to twelve months, but may take significantly longer. To demonstrate substantial equivalence, the manufacturer must show that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics, or different technological characteristics and the information in the premarket notification demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as the predicate device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.
If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo classification procedure, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.
After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, a de novo classification or PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires a premarket submission in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination.
Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a manufacturer documenting the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for every change. The FDA can always review these letters-to-file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until marketing authorization is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
De Novo Classification
Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, or FDAMA, established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into 

26



Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure.
This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, or FDASIA, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. Under FDASIA, the FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application, although the review of an application can occur over a significantly longer period of time. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would support a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.
The PMA Approval Process
Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. While our current products are subject to the 510(k) clearance pathway, any future products or modifications to our existing products that we plan to develop for a breast reconstruction indication would be subject to the PMA approval process.
Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application can occur over a significantly longer period of time, and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, or the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. The FDA considers a PMA or PMA supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an FDA request for information (e.g., a major deficiency letter) within 360 days. Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct inspections of the clinical trial data and clinical trial sites, as well as inspections of the manufacturing facility and processes. Overall, the FDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer.
The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s).
If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, the latter of which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval 

27



letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA, or the PMA is withdrawn and resubmitted when the data are available. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
New PMA applications or PMA supplements are required for changes to an approved device, such as modifications to the manufacturing process, equipment or facility, quality control procedures, sterilization, packaging, expiration date, labeling, device specifications, ingredients, materials or design. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory committee, depending on the nature of the proposed change.
In approving a PMA application, as a condition of approval, the FDA may also require some form of post-approval study or post-market surveillance, whereby the applicant conducts a follow-up study or follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional or longer term safety and effectiveness data for the device. The FDA may also require post-market surveillance for certain devices cleared under a 510(k) notification, such as implants or life-supporting or life-sustaining devices. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use.
The Investigational Device Process
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of investigational devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Some types of studies deemed to present a “non-significant risk” are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed and Institutional Review Board, or IRB approval is obtained. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under an approval with conditions. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by an appropriate IRB. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials, and although the FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward for a specified number of subjects, it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA good clinical practice regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study 

28



protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable, or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant marketing approval or clearance of a product.
Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation
After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply to our business operations, products and technologies. These include:

● | the FDA’s Quality Systems Regulations (“QSR”), which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling and marketing regulations which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provides adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | complying with requirements for Unique Device Identifiers on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | advertising and promotion requirements, including FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses and FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | device establishment, registration and listing requirements and annual reporting requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval or clearance of modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an order of repair, replacement or refund;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | device tracking requirements; and
--+----------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. Medical device manufacturers are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and other state, local and foreign regulatory authorities to assess compliance with 

29



the QSR and other applicable regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of any suppliers.
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:

● | warning letters, untitled letters, Form 483s, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | recall or seizure of products;
--+-------------------------------


● | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDA’s refusal of requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDA’s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

Regulatory System for Medical Devices in Europe
The European Union (“EU”) and the European Economic Area (“EEA”) (which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland) has a coordinated system for the authorization of medical devices.  Until May 25, 2021, medical devices were regulated by the Council Directive 93/42/EEC, or the Medical Devices Directive (“MDD”), which has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 2017/745, or the Medical Devices Regulation (“MDR”). There is a transition period during which certificates issued under the MDD remain valid, however, when such certificates expire (or, if earlier, by 27 May 2024) the devices must be certified under the new regime set forth in the MDR. However, in response to concerns raised about notified body capacity and the ability for devices to be re-certified within such time period, the European Commission has adopted a proposal to extend the transition period by some years, depending on the risk class of the device. Such proposal is currently being considered for adoption by the European Parliament and Council.
The MDR went into effect on May 26, 2021, and it:

● | strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforces surveillance once they are available;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | sets up a central database (Eudamed) to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | strengthens rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the MDR, the system of regulating medical devices operates by way of a certification for each medical device, which confirms that the device meets the relevant general safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I of 

30



the MDR. Each certificated device is marked with a CE mark which shows that the device has a certificat de conformité, also referred to as a certificate of conformity. The means for achieving the requirements for a CE mark varies according to the nature of the device. Devices are classified in accordance with their perceived risks, similarly to the U.S. system. The class of a product determines the requirements to be fulfilled in accordance with the MDR before a CE mark can be placed on a product. The procedure by which a device is assessed to confirm if it complies with the applicable safety and performance requirements is known as a conformity assessment. Conformity assessment procedures require an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product, and post-market experience in respect of similar products already marketed. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-certify compliance with the MDR based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the applicable requirements of the MDR, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of an independent organization accredited by a member state of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments, known as a notified body. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant general safety and performance requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EEA.
The MDR requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers (as well as other economic operators such as authorized representatives and importers) must register by submitting identification information to the electronic system (Eudamed), unless they have already registered, and manufacturers must assign a unique identifier to the device and provide it along with other core data to the unique device identifier, or UDI, database. These new requirements aim at ensuring better identification and traceability of the devices. Manufacturers are responsible for entering the necessary data on Eudamed, which includes the UDI database, and for keeping it up to date. Eudamed is not yet fully functional, however the European Commission is aiming to have a fully functional version of the Eudamed medical device database available in the second quarter of 2024. The Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG) has published guidance on administrative practices for manufacturers until Eudamed is fully functional.
Post-Brexit, the MDR does not apply in the United Kingdom (except for Northern Ireland, which under the Northern Ireland Protocol is bound by certain EU laws). The medical device legislative framework in the United Kingdom is set out in the Medical Devices Regulations 2002. These Regulations are based on the previous medical device directives of the EU but have been amended so that they function properly now the United Kingdom is no longer part of the EU. The amended Medical Devices Regulations 2002 have introduced several changes including (but not limited to) replacing the CE mark with a UKCA marking, requiring manufacturers outside of the United Kingdom to appoint a “UK Responsible Person” if they place devices on the market in the United Kingdom and more wide-ranging device registration requirements. Manufacturers can continue placing CE marked medical devices on the Great Britain market for the time being, however from July 2024, transitional arrangements will apply for CE marked medical devices placed on the Great Britain market. These transitional arrangements have not yet been brought into force through the UK medical devices regulations, but the UK Government intends to introduce legislation by Spring 2023 that will bring these into force.
​
Privacy and Security Laws
There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information, including health information. Among others, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations (collectively referred to as “HIPAA”) establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information (“PHI”) and require covered entities and business associates to implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form, among other requirements.
Violations of HIPAA may result in civil and criminal penalties. Companies subject to HIPAA must also comply with HIPAA’s breach notification rule which requires notification of affected patients and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and in certain cases of media outlets, in the case of a breach of unsecured PHI. The 

31



regulations also require business associates of covered entities to notify the covered entity of breaches by the business associate. State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states, and HIPAA standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing personal information. In addition, HIPAA mandates that HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and their business associates for compliance.
Many states have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health information, to which we are subject. These laws may be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA and other federal privacy laws. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) which creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General may bring enforcement actions for violations beginning July 1, 2020. The CCPA has been amended from time to time, and it remains unclear what, if any, further modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted. And the CPRA, which will take effect in most material respects on January 1, 2023, modifies the CCPA significantly, potentially resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses to comply.
We may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair privacy and security practices and deceptive statements about privacy and security, laws that place specific requirements on certain types of activities, such as data security and texting, and laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach.
Foreign data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation, (“GDPR”) may also apply to health-related and other personal information belonging to individuals who reside outside of the U.S. The GDPR went into effect in the European Union in May 2018 and introduced strict requirements for processing the personal data of data subjects residing in the European Economic Area. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates cross-border transfers of personal data and requires transferee countries to have protections equivalent to protections available in the EU. Because of the uncertainty created by the Court of Justice of the European Union’s decision invalidating the EU/US Privacy Shield (the primary mechanism to effectuate the flow of data from the EU to the United States), there continues to be uncertainty as to appropriate transfer mechanism for the transfer of data from the EU to the United States. 
​
Further, the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty regarding data protection regulation in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has transposed the GDPR into domestic law with a United Kingdom version of the GDPR that took effect in January 2021 (“UK GDPR”). Currently, the GDPR and UK GDPR remain largely aligned, but the United Kingdom has announced plans to reform the country’s data protection legal framework in its Data Reform Bill, which will introduce significant changes from the GDPR. This may lead to divergence between the GDPR and UK GDPR.
​
EU member states have introduced national laws implementing the GDPR which impose additional requirements; this adds to the complexity of processing personal data in or from the EEA or United Kingdom. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised.
Anti-Kickback Statutes
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from (among other things) knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce the referral of an individual, or the recommending, furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid.
Courts have interpreted the Anti-Kickback Statute quite broadly, holding that the statute will be violated if even one purpose of a payment — though not its sole or primary purpose — is to induce an act prohibited by the statute with a willful intent to act improperly. The statute prohibits many arrangements and practices that are otherwise lawful in 

32



businesses outside of the healthcare industry. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Prosecutors may infer intent from the surrounding circumstances and, because courts have interpreted the statute to be violated if even one purpose of a payment is to induce the purchase of items or services paid for by federal healthcare programs, prosecutors have broad discretion in choosing arrangements to prosecute under the statute. There are statutory exceptions and regulatory “safe harbors” available to protect certain appropriately structured arrangements that otherwise would implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute and those who structure their business arrangements to satisfy all of the criteria of a safe harbor are protected from liability under the statute. Our business is subject to these laws.
Many states have adopted anti-kickback and self-referral laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute; however, some of these state prohibitions are broader in scope and apply to arrangements involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, and not only by Medicare, Medicaid or another federal healthcare program. These state laws do not always have the same exceptions or safe harbors as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.
False Claims Laws
The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any individual or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam or “whistleblower” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has violated the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of lawsuits brought against healthcare industry participants by private individuals has increased dramatically.
There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government, but also may arise when an entity knowingly makes a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government. Various states have also enacted false claims and insurance fraud laws that are analogous to the federal False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply to claims submitted to any third-party payor and are not limited to claims submitted to a federal healthcare program. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. A determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on a company’s ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
Transparency Laws
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (“Sunshine Act”) which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) generally requires certain manufacturers of a drug, device, biologic or other medical supply that is covered by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program and applicable GPOs to report on an annual basis: (i) certain payments and other transfers of value given to certain healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals and (ii) any ownership or investment interest that certain healthcare professionals, or their immediate family members, have in their company. The payments required to be reported include the cost of meals provided to a healthcare professional, travel reimbursements and other transfers of value, including those provided as part of contracted services such as speaker programs, advisory boards, consultation services and clinical trial services. Under the statute, the federal government makes reported information available to the public. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements can result in significant civil monetary penalties or criminal penalties if an entity intentionally makes false statements in the reports.
There has been a recent trend of separate state regulation of payments and transfers of value by manufacturers of medical devices to healthcare professionals and entities, however, and some state transparency laws apply more broadly than the federal Sunshine Act. There are also an increasing number of analogous state laws that require manufacturers to file reports with states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. For example, several states have enacted legislation requiring manufacturers to, among other things, establish and implement commercial compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic

public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities and/or register their sales representatives. Certain state laws also regulate manufacturers’ use of physician and patient identifiable data. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities. All of our activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition.
Other Federal Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
We may also be subject to other federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including provisions of HIPAA, which imposes criminal liability and amends provisions on the reporting, investigation, enforcement, and penalizing of civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and recklessly executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, as well as knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact by any trick, scheme or device or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government-sponsored programs. As with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits U.S. businesses and their representatives from offering to pay, paying, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records, which in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. Our industry is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. Recently, the SEC and Department of Justice have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies. Violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, the closing down of our facilities, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Enforcement actions may be brought by the Department of Justice or the SEC, and recent enacted legislation has expanded the SEC’s power to seek disgorgement in all FCPA cases filed in federal court and extended the statute of limitations in SEC enforcement actions in intent-based claims such as those under the FCPA from five years to ten years.
International Laws
In Europe, and throughout the world, other countries have enacted anti-bribery laws and/or regulations similar to the FCPA. Violations of any of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.
There are also international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain required patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.

U.S. Healthcare Reform
The U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls and restrictions on reimbursement. 
In the U.S., the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the “Affordable Care Act”, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms. 
There have been significant ongoing judicial, administrative, executive and legislative efforts to modify or eliminate the Affordable Care Act. For example, the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code, commonly referred to as the individual mandate. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. Subsequent litigation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or the “CARES Act”, which was designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021, which was further extended through March 31, 2022. Following the suspension, a 1% payment reduction began April 1, 2022 and remained through June 30, 2022. The 2% payment reduction resumed on July 1, 2022. The sequester will remain in place through 2030. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
The Affordable Care Act has been subject to challenges in the courts. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case to the Texas District Court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the entire Affordable Care Act. An appeal was taken to the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the law as they had not alleged personal injury traceable to the allegedly unlawful conduct.  As a result, the Supreme Court did not rule on the constitutionality of the ACA or any of its provisions.
Further changes to and under the Affordable Care Act remain possible, but it is unknown what form any such changes or any law proposed to replace or revise the Affordable Care Act would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. 
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control healthcare costs, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

We expect that additional federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures.
Pricing and Reimbursement
In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors. Third party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products, and there are continuing legislative and regulatory efforts by the federal government and the states to reduce the cost of medical products and services overall. We may need to conduct expensive studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product or procedure using the product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate revenue levels. Future legislation could limit payments for medical devices, including our products and our future products.
The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of less costly products. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for our products. The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on medical product and service pricing.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 173 employees worldwide. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe we have good relationships with our employees.
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our employees. Accordingly, we are committed to their health, safety and wellness. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security so they can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. 

We strive to provide a competitive mix of pay, benefits and services that help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs include variable incentive compensation plans, potential annual discretionary bonuses, stock awards, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and flexible work schedules, among others. In addition to our broad-based equity award programs, we have used targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions to enhance retention of personnel.
