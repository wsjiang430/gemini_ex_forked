Item 1. | Business

Introductory Note
The following describes the business of Fidelity National Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Except where otherwise noted, all references to "we," "us," "our", the "Company" or "FNF" are to Fidelity National Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries, taken together.
Overview
We are a leading provider of (i) title insurance, escrow and other title-related services, including trust activities, trustee sales guarantees, recordings and reconveyances and home warranty products and (ii) transaction services to the real estate and mortgage industries. FNF is one of the nation’s largest title insurance companies operating through its title insurance underwriters - Fidelity National Title Insurance Company ("FNTIC"), Chicago Title Insurance Company ("Chicago Title"), Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company ("Commonwealth Title"), Alamo Title Insurance and National Title Insurance of New York Inc. - which collectively issue more title insurance policies than any other title company in the United States. Through our subsidiary ServiceLink Holdings, LLC ("ServiceLink"), we provide mortgage transaction services including title-related services and facilitation of production and management of mortgage loans. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had the following reporting segments:

• | Title. This segment consists of the operations of our title insurance underwriters and related businesses which provide title insurance and escrow and other title-related services including trust activities, trustee sales guarantees, and home warranty products. This segment also includes our transaction services business, which includes other title-related services used in the production and management of mortgage loans, including mortgage loans that experience default.


• | Corporate and Other. This segment consists of the operations of the parent holding company, our real estate technology subsidiaries, other smaller, non-title businesses and certain unallocated corporate overhead expenses and eliminations of revenues and expenses between it and our Title segment.

Competitive Strengths
We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:
Corporate principles.  A cornerstone of our management philosophy and operating success is the six fundamental precepts upon which we were founded, which are:

• | Autonomy and entrepreneurship;


• | Bias for action;


• | Customer-oriented and motivated;


• | Minimize bureaucracy;


• | Employee ownership; and


• | Highest standard of conduct.

These six precepts are emphasized to our employees from the first day of employment and are integral to many of our strategies described below.
Competitive cost structure.  We have been able to maintain competitive operating margins in part by monitoring our businesses in a disciplined manner through continual evaluation of title order activity and management of our cost structure. When compared to our industry competitors, we also believe that our structure is more efficiently designed, which allows us to operate with lower overhead costs.
Leading title insurance company.  We are one of the largest title insurance companies in the United States and a leading provider of title insurance and escrow and other title-related services for real estate transactions. Through the third quarter of 2018, our insurance companies had a 33.3% share of the U.S. title insurance market, according to the American Land Title Association ("ALTA").
Established relationships with our customers.  We have strong relationships with the customers who use our title services. Our distribution network, which includes approximately 1,400 direct residential title offices and more than 5,200 agents, is among the largest in the United States. We also benefit from strong brand recognition in our multiple title brands that allows us to access a broader client base than if we operated under a single consolidated brand and provides our customers with a choice among brands.
Strong value proposition for our customers.  We provide our customers with title insurance and escrow and other title-related services that support their ability to effectively close real estate transactions. We help make the real estate closing process more 
 1

efficient for our customers by offering a single point of access to a broad platform of title-related products and resources necessary to close real estate transactions.
Proven management team.  The managers of our operating businesses have successfully built our title business over an extended period of time, resulting in our business attaining the size, scope and presence in the industry that it has today. Our managers have demonstrated their leadership ability during numerous acquisitions through which we have grown and throughout a number of business cycles and significant periods of industry change.
Commercial title insurance.  While residential title insurance comprises the majority of our business, we are also a significant provider of commercial real estate title insurance in the United States. Our network of agents, attorneys, underwriters and closers that service the commercial real estate markets is one of the largest in the industry. Our commercial network combined with our financial strength makes our title insurance operations attractive to large national lenders that require the underwriting and issuing of larger commercial title policies.
We believe that our competitive strengths position us well to take advantage of future changes to the real estate market.
Strategy
Our strategy in the title business is to maximize operating profits by increasing our market share and managing operating expenses throughout the real estate business cycle. To accomplish our goals, we intend to do the following:

• | Continue to operate multiple title brands independently. We believe that in order to maintain and strengthen our title insurance customer base, we must operate our strongest brands in a given marketplace independently of each other. Our national and regional brands include Fidelity National Title, Chicago Title, Commonwealth Land Title, Lawyers Title, Ticor Title, Alamo Title, and National Title of New York. In our largest markets, we operate multiple brands. This approach allows us to continue to attract customers who identify with a particular brand and allows us to utilize a broader base of local agents and local operations than we would have with a single consolidated brand. 


• | Consistently deliver superior customer service. We believe customer service and consistent product delivery are the most important factors in attracting and retaining customers. Our ability to provide superior customer service and consistent product delivery requires continued focus on providing high quality service and products at competitive prices. Our goal is to continue to improve the experience of our customers, in all aspects of our business. 


• | Manage our operations successfully through business cycles. We operate in a cyclical industry and our ability to diversify our revenue base within our title insurance business and manage the duration of our investments may allow us to better operate in this cyclical business. Maintaining a broad geographic revenue base, utilizing both direct and independent agency operations and pursuing both residential and commercial title insurance business help diversify our title insurance revenues. We continue to monitor, evaluate and execute upon the consolidation of administrative functions, legal entity structure, and office consolidation, as necessary, to respond to the continually changing marketplace. We maintain shorter durations on our investment portfolio to mitigate our interest rate risk. A more detailed discussion of our investment strategies is included in “Investment Policies and Investment Portfolio.” 


• | Continue to improve our products and technology. As a national provider of real estate transaction products and services, we participate in an industry that is subject to significant change, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate industry changes and offer products and services that meet evolving industry standards. In connection with our service offerings, we are continuing to deploy new information system technologies to our direct and agency operations. We expect to improve the process of ordering title and escrow services and improve the delivery of our products to our customers. 


• | Maintain values supporting our strategy. We believe that our continued focus on and support of our long-established corporate culture will reinforce and support our business strategy. Our goal is to foster and support a corporate culture where our employees and agents seek to operate independently and maintain profitability at the local level while forming close customer relationships by meeting customer needs and improving customer service. Utilizing a relatively flat managerial structure and providing our employees with a sense of individual ownership support this goal. 


• | Effectively manage costs based on economic factors. We believe that our focus on our operating margins is essential to our continued success in the title insurance business. Regardless of the business cycle in which we may be operating, we seek to continue to evaluate and manage our cost structure and make appropriate adjustments where economic conditions dictate. This continual focus on our cost structure helps us to better maintain our operating margins. 

Acquisitions, Dispositions, Minority Owned Operating Subsidiaries and Financings
Acquisitions have been an important part of our growth strategy and dispositions have been an important aspect of our strategy of returning value to shareholders. On an ongoing basis, with assistance from our advisors, we actively evaluate possible transactions, such as acquisitions and dispositions of business units and operating assets and business combination transactions.
 2

In the future, we may seek to sell certain investments or other assets to increase our liquidity. In the past we have obtained majority and minority investments in entities and securities where we see the potential to achieve above market returns. Fundamentally our goal is to acquire quality companies that are run by best in class management teams and that have attractive organic and acquired growth opportunities. We leverage our operational expertise and track record of growing industry-leading companies and also our active interaction with the acquired company's management directly or through our board of directors, to ultimately provide value for our shareholders.
There can be no assurance that any suitable opportunities will arise or that any particular transaction will be completed. We have made a number of acquisitions and dispositions over the past several years to strengthen and expand our service offerings and customer base in our various businesses, to expand into other businesses or where we otherwise saw value, and to monetize investments in assets and businesses.
Refer to discussion under Selected Financial Data and Certain Factors Affecting Comparability included in Item 6 and Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Annual Report"), respectively, which are incorporated by reference into this Item 1 of Part I, for further discussion of material dispositions of businesses.
Pending Acquisition of Stewart
On March 18, 2018, we signed a merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement") to acquire Stewart Information Services Corporation ("Stewart") (NYSE: STC) (the "Stewart Merger"), pursuant to which each share of Stewart common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Stewart Merger (other than shares owned by Stewart, its subsidiaries, FNF or the wholly-owned subsidiaries of FNF party to the Merger Agreement and shares in respect of which appraisal rights have been properly exercised and perfected under Delaware law), will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share, (i) $50.00 in cash, (ii) 1.2850 shares of FNF common stock, or (iii) $25.00 in cash and 0.6425 shares of FNF common stock, subject to potential adjustment (as described below) and proration to the extent the option to receive cash or the option to receive stock is oversubscribed.
FNF currently intends to fund the $1.2 billion purchase price, 50% in cash and 50% in FNF common stock, through a combination of cash on hand at FNF, the issuance of FNF common stock to Stewart stockholders, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, if necessary. Including the assumption of $109 million of Stewart's debt, our pro forma debt to total capital ratio is expected to be no more than approximately 20% at the close of the Stewart Merger.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, if the combined company is required to divest assets or businesses for which 2017 annual revenues exceed $75 million, up to a cap of $225 million, in order to receive required regulatory approvals, the purchase price will be adjusted down on a pro-rata basis to a minimum purchase price of $45.50 per share of common stock of Stewart. If the Stewart Merger is not completed for failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals, we would be required to pay a reverse break-up fee of $50 million to Stewart.
On May 31, 2018, we received a request for additional information and documentary material, often referred to as a “Second Request,” from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) in connection with the FTC’s Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), regulatory review of the Stewart Merger.We continue to work through the regulatory process for the Stewart Merger and are currently engaged in responding to the Second Request related to the FTC's HSR Act regulatory review of the transaction. Responses to nearly all the FTC's requests for information and documentation have been submitted. From December 29, 2018 through January 25, 2019, the FTC suspended its review of the Stewart Merger and the materials related thereto due to a lapse in government funding caused by a partial shutdown of the U.S. Federal Government, potentially creating significant backlog when the FTC resumed its operations on January 28, 2019. As such, we are unable to determine the extent of any such delay in the FTC’s review.
On August 1, 2018, our registration statement on Form S-4 related to the Stewart Merger was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").
On August 21, 2018, we received a “no-action letter” from the Canadian Competition Bureau (the “Bureau”), indicating that the Bureau does not intend to oppose the completion of the Stewart Merger.
The special meeting of Stewart stockholders to vote on the Stewart Merger was held on September 5, 2018 and a majority of the Stewart stockholders voted to approve the Stewart Merger. More than 99% of the votes cast, representing approximately 79% of the outstanding shares of Stewart common stock as of July 10, 2018, the record date for the special meeting, were cast in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement.
We have filed applications regarding acquisition of control of the Stewart domestic insurers with the states of Texas and New York. The Texas application regarding acquisition of control of Stewart Title Guaranty Company, a Texas domiciled title insurance company licensed in 48 states, is under review by the Texas Department of Insurance.
On January 31, 2019, the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) provided written notice to us of its disapproval of our application to acquire control of Stewart Title Insurance Company, a New York domiciled title insurance company that is licensed only in the State of New York. Receipt of approval from the NYDFS is a condition to closing the Stewart 
 3

Merger. FNF and Stewart are evaluating the appropriate course of action in light of the NYDFS’ determination, which may include a discussion with the NYDFS to better understand its concerns and respond to the letter. Through January 31, 2019, we have received 28 Form E state regulatory approvals relating to the Stewart Merger. 
The closing of the Stewart Merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including federal and state regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.
Title Insurance
Market for title insurance.  According to Demotech Performance of Title Insurance Companies 2018 Edition, an annual compilation of financial information from the title insurance industry that is published by Demotech Inc. ("Demotech"), an independent firm , total operating income for the entire U.S. title insurance industry has increased over the last five years from approximately $13.4 billion in 2013 to $15.6 billion in 2017, which represents a $0.7 billion increase from 2016. The size of the industry is closely tied to various macroeconomic factors, including, but not limited to, growth in the gross domestic product, inflation, unemployment, the availability of credit, consumer confidence, interest rates, and sales volumes and prices for new and existing homes, as well as the volume of refinancing of previously issued mortgages.
Most real estate transactions consummated in the U.S. require the use of title insurance by a lending institution before the transaction can be completed. Generally, revenues from title insurance policies are directly correlated with the value of the property underlying the title policy, and appreciation or depreciation in the overall value of the real estate market are major factors in total industry revenues. Industry revenues are also driven by factors affecting the volume of real estate closings, such as the state of the economy, the availability of mortgage funding, and changes in interest rates, which affect demand for new mortgage loans and refinancing transactions. 
The U.S. title insurance industry is concentrated among a handful of industry participants. According to Demotech, the top four title insurance groups accounted for 85% of net premiums written in 2017. Approximately 35 independent title insurance companies accounted for the remaining 15% of net premiums written in 2017. Consolidation has created opportunities for increased financial and operating efficiencies for the industry’s largest participants and should continue to drive profitability and market share in the industry.
Our Title segment revenue is closely related to the level of real estate activity which includes sales, mortgage financing and mortgage refinancing. For further discussion of current trends in real estate activity in the United States, see discussion under Business Trends and Conditions included in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report, which is incorporated by reference into this Item 1 of Part I.
Title Insurance Policies.  Generally, real estate buyers and mortgage lenders purchase title insurance to insure good and marketable title to real estate and priority of lien. A brief generalized description of the process of issuing a title insurance policy is as follows:

• | The customer, typically a real estate salesperson or broker, escrow agent, attorney or lender, places an order for a title policy.


• | Company personnel note the specifics of the title policy order and place a request with the title company or its agents for a preliminary report or commitment.


• | After the relevant historical data on the property is compiled, the title officer prepares a preliminary report that documents the current status of title to the property, any exclusions, exceptions and/or limitations that the title company might include in the policy, and specific issues that need to be addressed and resolved by the parties to the transaction before the title policy will be issued.


• | The preliminary report is circulated to all the parties for satisfaction of any specific issues.


• | After the specific issues identified in the preliminary report are satisfied, an escrow agent closes the transaction in accordance with the instructions of the parties and the title company’s conditions.


• | Once the transaction is closed and all monies have been released, the title company issues a title insurance policy.

In real estate transactions financed with a mortgage, virtually all real property mortgage lenders require their borrowers to obtain a title insurance policy at the time a mortgage loan is made. This lender’s policy insures the lender against any defect affecting the priority of the mortgage in an amount equal to the outstanding balance of the related mortgage loan. An owner’s policy is typically also issued, insuring the buyer against defects in title in an amount equal to the purchase price. In a refinancing transaction, only a lender’s policy is generally purchased because ownership of the property has not changed. In the case of an all-cash real estate purchase, no lender’s policy is issued but typically an owner’s title policy is issued.
Title insurance premiums paid in connection with a title insurance policy are based on (and typically are a percentage of) either the amount of the mortgage loan or the purchase price of the property insured. Applicable state insurance regulations or regulatory practices may limit the maximum, or in some cases the minimum, premium that can be charged on a policy. Title insurance premiums are due in full at the closing of the real estate transaction. 
 4

The amount of the insured risk or “face amount” of insurance under a title insurance policy is generally equal to either the amount of the loan secured by the property or the purchase price of the property. The title insurer is also responsible for the cost of defending the insured title against covered claims. The insurer’s actual exposure at any given time, however, generally is less than the total face amount of policies outstanding because the coverage of a lender’s policy is reduced and eventually terminated as a result of payments on the mortgage loan. A title insurer also generally does not know when a property has been sold or refinanced except when it issues the replacement coverage. Because of these factors, the total liability of a title underwriter on outstanding policies cannot be precisely determined.
Title insurance companies typically issue title insurance policies directly through branch offices or through affiliated title agencies, or indirectly through independent third party agencies unaffiliated with the title insurance company. Where the policy is issued through a branch or wholly-owned subsidiary agency operation, the title insurance company typically performs or directs the title search, and the premiums collected are retained by the title company. Where the policy is issued through an independent agent, the agent generally performs the title search (in some areas searches are performed by approved attorneys), examines the title, collects the premium and retains a majority of the premium. The remainder of the premium is remitted to the title insurance company as compensation, part of which is for bearing the risk of loss in the event a claim is made under the policy. The percentage of the premium retained by an agent varies from region to region and is sometimes regulated by the states. The title insurance company is obligated to pay title claims in accordance with the terms of its policies, regardless of whether the title insurance company issues policies through its direct operations or through independent agents.
 Prior to issuing policies, title insurers and their agents attempt to reduce the risk of future claim losses by accurately performing title searches and examinations. A title insurance company’s predominant expense relates to such searches and examinations, the preparation of preliminary title reports, policies or commitments, the maintenance of "title plants,” which are indexed compilations of public records, maps and other relevant historical documents, and the facilitation and closing of real estate transactions. Claim losses generally result from errors made in the title search and examination process, from hidden defects such as fraud, forgery, incapacity, or missing heirs of the property, and from closing-related errors.
Residential real estate business results from the construction, sale, resale and refinancing of residential properties, while commercial real estate business results from similar activities with respect to properties with a business or commercial use. Commercial real estate title insurance policies insure title to commercial real property, and generally involve higher coverage amounts and yield higher premiums. Residential real estate transaction volume is primarily affected by macroeconomic and seasonal factors while commercial real estate transaction volume is affected primarily by fluctuations in local supply and demand conditions for commercial space.
Direct and Agency Operations.  We provide title insurance services through our direct operations and through independent title insurance agents who issue title policies on behalf of our title insurance companies. Our title insurance companies determine the terms and conditions upon which they will insure title to the real property according to our underwriting standards, policies and procedures.
Direct Operations.  Our direct operations include both the operations of our underwriters and those of affiliated agencies. In our direct operations, the title insurer issues the title insurance policy and retains the entire premium paid in connection with the transaction. Our direct operations provide the following benefits:

• | higher margins because we retain the entire premium from each transaction instead of paying a commission to an independent agent;


• | continuity of service levels to a broad range of customers; and


• | additional sources of income through escrow and closing services.

We have approximately 1,400 offices throughout the U.S. primarily providing residential real estate title insurance. We continuously monitor the number of direct offices to make sure that it remains in line with our strategy and the current economic environment. Our commercial real estate title insurance business is operated primarily through our direct operations. We maintain direct operations for our commercial title insurance business in all the major real estate markets including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Seattle and Washington D.C.
Agency Operations.  In our agency operations, the search and examination function is performed by an independent agent or the agent may purchase the search product from us. In either case, the agent is responsible to ensure that the search and examination is completed. The agent thus retains the majority of the title premium collected, with the balance remitted to the title underwriter for bearing the risk of loss in the event that a claim is made under the title insurance policy. Independent agents may select among several title underwriters based upon their relationship with the underwriter, the amount of the premium “split” offered by the underwriter, the overall terms and conditions of the agency agreement and the scope of services offered to the agent. Premium splits vary by geographic region, and in some states are fixed by insurance regulatory requirements. Our relationship with each agent is governed by an agency agreement defining how the agent issues a title insurance policy on our behalf. The agency agreement also sets forth the agent’s liability to us for policy losses attributable to the agent’s errors. An agency agreement is usually terminable without cause upon 30 days notice or immediately for cause. In determining whether to engage or retain an 
 5

independent agent, we consider the agent’s experience, financial condition and loss history. For each agent with whom we enter into an agency agreement, we maintain financial and loss experience records. We also conduct periodic audits of our agents and strategically manage the number of agents with which we transact business in an effort to reduce future expenses and manage risks. As of December 31, 2018, we transact business with approximately 5,200 agents.
 Fees and Premiums.  One method of analyzing our business is to examine the level of premiums generated by direct and agency operations.
The following table presents the percentages of our title insurance premiums generated by direct and agency operations:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 
 | Amount | | % | | Amount | | % | | Amount | | %
 | (Dollars in millions) 
Direct | $ | 2,221 | | | 45.2 | % | | $ | 2,170 | | | 44.3 | % | $ | 2,097 | 44.4 | %
Agency | 2,690 | | | 54.8 | | | 2,723 | | | 55.7 | | | 2,626 | | 55.6 
Total title insurance premiums | $ | 4,911 | | | 100.0 | % | | $ | 4,893 | | | 100.0 | % | $ | 4,723 | 100.0 | %

The premium for title insurance is due in full when the real estate transaction is closed. We recognize title insurance premium revenues from direct operations upon the closing of the transaction. Premium revenues from agency operations include an accrual based on estimates of the volume of transactions that have closed in a particular period for which premiums have not yet been reported to us. The accrual for agency premiums is necessary because of the lag between the closing of these transactions and the reporting of these policies to us by the agent, and is based on estimates utilizing historical information.
Escrow, Title-Related and Other Fees.  In addition to fees for underwriting title insurance policies, we derive a significant amount of our revenues from escrow and other title-related services including closing and trust activities, trustee sales guarantees, recordings and reconveyances, and home warranty products. The escrow and other services provided by us include all of those typically required in connection with residential and commercial real estate purchases and refinance activities. Escrow, title-related and other fees included in our Title segment represented approximately 30.6%, 30.2%, and 30.5% of total Title segment revenues in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Sales and Marketing. We market and distribute our title and escrow products and services to customers in the residential and commercial market sectors of the real estate industry through customer solicitation by sales personnel. Although in many instances the individual homeowner is the beneficiary of a title insurance policy, we do not focus our marketing efforts on the homeowner. We actively encourage our sales personnel to develop new business relationships with persons in the real estate community, such as real estate sales agents and brokers, financial institutions, independent escrow companies and title agents, real estate developers, mortgage brokers and attorneys who order title insurance policies for their clients. While our smaller, local clients remain important, large customers, such as national residential mortgage lenders, real estate investment trusts and developers are an important part of our business. The buying criteria of locally based clients differ from those of large, geographically diverse customers in that the former tend to emphasize personal relationships and ease of transaction execution, while the latter generally place more emphasis on consistent product delivery across diverse geographical regions and the ability of service providers to meet their information systems requirements for electronic product delivery.
Claims. An important part of our operations is the handling of title and escrow claims. We employ a large staff of attorneys in our claims department. Our claims processing centers are located in Omaha, Nebraska and Jacksonville, Florida. In-house claims counsel are also located in other parts of the country.
Claims result from a wide range of causes. These causes generally include, but are not limited to, search and exam errors, forgeries, incorrect legal descriptions, signature and notary errors, unrecorded liens, mechanics’ liens, the failure to pay off existing liens, mortgage lending fraud, mishandling or theft of settlement funds (including independent agency theft), and mistakes in the escrow process. Under our policies, we are required to defend insureds when covered claims are filed against their interest in the property. Some claimants seek damages in excess of policy limits. Those claims are based on various legal theories, including in some cases allegations of negligence or an intentional tort. We occasionally incur losses in excess of policy limits. Experience shows that most policy claims and claim payments are made in the first five years after the policy has been issued, although claims may also be reported and paid many years later.
Title losses due to independent agency defalcations typically occur when the independent agency misappropriates funds from escrow accounts under its control. Such losses are usually discovered when the independent agency fails to pay off an outstanding mortgage loan at closing (or immediately thereafter) from the proceeds of the new loan. Once the previous lender determines that its loan has not been paid off timely, it will file a claim against the title insurer.
Claims can be complex, vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions and the legal environment existing at the time claims are processed. In our commercial title business, we may issue polices with face amounts 
 6

well in excess of $100 million, and from time to time claims are submitted with respect to large policies. We believe we are appropriately reserved with respect to all claims (large and small) that we currently face. Occasionally we experience large losses from title policies that have been issued or from our escrow operations, or overall worsening loss payment experience, which require us to increase our title loss reserves. These events are unpredictable and adversely affect our earnings. Claims can result in litigation in which we may represent our insured and/or ourselves. We consider this type of litigation to be an ordinary course aspect of the conduct of our business.
Reinsurance and Coinsurance.  We limit our maximum loss exposure by reinsuring risks with other insurers under excess of loss and case-by-case (“facultative”) reinsurance agreements. Reinsurance agreements generally provide that the reinsurer is liable for loss and loss adjustment expense payments exceeding the amount retained by the ceding company. However, the ceding company remains primarily liable to the insured whether or not the reinsurer is able to meet its contractual obligations. Facultative reinsurance agreements are entered into with other title insurers when the transaction to be insured will exceed state statutory or self-imposed limits. Excess of loss reinsurance coverage protects us from a large loss from a single loss occurrence. Our excess of loss reinsurance coverage is split into four contracts. The first excess of loss reinsurance contract provides an $80 million aggregate limit of coverage from a single loss occurrence for residential and commercial losses in excess of a $20 million retention per single loss occurrence ("First XOL Contract"). The second excess of loss reinsurance contract ("Second XOL Contract") provides an additional $300 million aggregate limit of coverage, with the Company co-participating at approximately 10%.  The third excess of loss reinsurance contract ("Third XOL Contract") provides an additional $80 million aggregate limit of coverage, with the Company co-participating at approximately 10%.  The fourth excess of loss reinsurance contract ("Fourth XOL Contract") provides an additional $220 million aggregate limit of coverage, with the Company co-participating at approximately 10%. Subject to the Company’s retention and co-participation on the Second, Third and Fourth XOL Contracts, the maximum coverage provided under our excess of loss reinsurance coverage is $620 million.
 In addition to reinsurance, we carry errors and omissions insurance and fidelity bond coverage, each of which can provide protection to us in the event of certain types of losses that can occur in our businesses.
Our policy is to be selective in choosing our reinsurers, seeking only those companies that we consider to be financially stable and adequately capitalized. In an effort to minimize exposure to the insolvency of a reinsurer, we periodically review the financial condition of our reinsurers.
We also use coinsurance in our commercial title business to provide coverage in amounts greater than we would be willing or able to provide individually. In coinsurance transactions, each individual underwriting company issues a separate policy and assumes a portion of the overall total risk. As a coinsurer we are only liable for the portion of the risk we assume.
We also earn a small amount of additional income, which is reflected in our direct premiums, by assuming reinsurance for certain risks of other title insurers.
Competition.  Competition in the title insurance industry is based primarily on service and price. The number and size of competing companies varies in the different geographic areas in which we conduct our business. In our principal markets, competitors include other major title underwriters such as First American Financial Corporation, Old Republic International Corporation, Stewart Information Services Corporation, AmTrust Title Insurance Company, Westcor Land Title Insurance Company, and WFG National Title Insurance Company, as well as numerous smaller title insurance companies, underwritten title companies and independent agency operations at the regional and local level. The addition or removal of regulatory barriers might result in changes to competition in the title insurance business. New competitors may include diversified financial services companies that have greater financial resources than we do and possess other competitive advantages. Competition among the major title insurance companies, expansion by smaller regional companies and any new entrants with alternative products could affect our business operations and financial condition.
 Regulation. Our insurance subsidiaries, including title insurers, underwritten title companies and insurance agencies, are subject to extensive regulation under applicable state laws. Each of the insurers is subject to a holding company act in its state of domicile, which regulates, among other matters, the ability to pay dividends and enter into transactions with affiliates. The laws of most states in which we transact business establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relating to issuing and revoking licenses to transact business, regulating trade practices, licensing agents, approving policy forms, accounting practices, financial practices, establishing reserve and capital and surplus as regards policyholders (“capital and surplus”) requirements, defining suitable investments for reserves and capital and surplus and approving rate schedules. The process of state regulation of changes in rates ranges from states which set rates, to states where individual companies or associations of companies prepare rate filings which are submitted for approval, to a few states in which rate changes do not need to be filed for approval.
Since we are governed by both state and federal governments and the applicable insurance laws and regulations are constantly subject to change, it is not possible to predict the potential effects on our insurance operations of any laws or regulations that may become more restrictive in the future or if new restrictive laws will be enacted.
 Pursuant to statutory accounting requirements of the various states in which our title insurers are domiciled, these insurers must defer a portion of premiums as an unearned premium reserve for the protection of policyholders (in addition to their reserves 
 7

for known claims) and must maintain qualified assets in an amount equal to the statutory requirements. The level of unearned premium reserve required to be maintained at any time is determined by a statutory formula based upon either the age, number of policies, and dollar amount of policy liabilities underwritten, or the age and dollar amount of statutory premiums written. As of December 31, 2018, the combined statutory unearned premium reserve required and reported for our title insurers was $1,412 million. In addition to statutory unearned premium reserves and reserves for known claims, each of our insurers maintains surplus funds for policyholder protection and business operations.
Each of our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by the insurance regulatory authority in its respective state of domicile, as well as that of each state in which it is licensed. The insurance commissioners of their respective states of domicile are the primary regulators of our insurance subsidiaries. Each of the insurers is subject to periodic regulatory financial examination by regulatory authorities.
Under the statutes governing insurance holding companies in most states, insurers may not enter into certain transactions, including sales, reinsurance agreements and service or management contracts, with their affiliates unless the regulatory authority of the insurer’s state of domicile has received notice at least 30 days prior to the intended effective date of such transaction and has not objected to, or has approved, the transaction within the 30-day period.
In addition to state-level regulation, our title insurance and certain other real estate businesses are subject to regulation by federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). The CFPB was established under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ("Dodd-Frank") which also included regulation over financial services and other lending related businesses. The CFPB has broad authority to regulate, among other areas, the mortgage and real estate markets in matters pertaining to consumers. This authority includes the enforcement of the Truth-in-Lending Act ("TILA") and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (individually, "RESPA", and together, "TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure" or "TRID") formerly placed with the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  
 As a holding company with no significant business operations of our own, we depend on dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries as the principal source of cash to meet our obligations, including the payment of interest on and repayment of principal of any debt obligations, and to pay any dividends to our shareholders. The payment of dividends or other distributions to us by our insurers is regulated by the insurance laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile. In general, an insurance company subsidiary may not pay an “extraordinary” dividend or distribution unless the applicable insurance regulator has received notice of the intended payment at least 30 days prior to payment and has not objected to or has approved the payment within the 30-day period. In general, an “extraordinary” dividend or distribution is statutorily defined as a dividend or distribution that, together with other dividends and distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of:

• | 10% of the insurer’s statutory surplus as of the immediately prior year end; or


• | the statutory net income of the insurer during the prior calendar year.

The laws and regulations of some jurisdictions also prohibit an insurer from declaring or paying a dividend except out of its earned surplus or require the insurer to obtain prior regulatory approval. During 2019, our directly owned title insurers can pay dividends or make distributions to us of approximately $512 million; however, insurance regulators have the authority to prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by our title insurers to us (such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for other services) if they determine that such payment could be adverse to our policyholders. There are no restrictions on our retained earnings regarding our ability to pay dividends to shareholders.
The combined statutory capital and surplus of our title insurers was approximately $1,383 million and $1,389 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The combined statutory earnings of our title insurers were $625 million, $434 million, and $541 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
As a condition to continued authority to underwrite policies in the states in which our insurers conduct their business, they are required to pay certain fees and file information regarding their officers, directors and financial condition.
 Pursuant to statutory requirements of the various states in which our insurers are domiciled, such insurers must maintain certain levels of minimum capital and surplus. Required levels of minimum capital and surplus are not significant to the insurers individually or in the aggregate. Each of our insurers has complied with the minimum statutory requirements as of December 31, 2018.
 Our underwritten title companies, primarily those domiciled in California, are also subject to certain regulation by insurance regulatory or banking authorities relating to their net worth and working capital. Minimum net worth and working capital requirements for each underwritten title company is less than $1 million. These companies were in compliance with their respective minimum net worth and working capital requirements at December 31, 2018.
 From time to time we receive inquiries and requests for information from state insurance departments, attorneys general and other regulatory agencies about various matters relating to our business. Sometimes these take the form of civil investigative demands or subpoenas. We cooperate with all such inquiries and we have responded to or are currently responding to inquiries from multiple governmental agencies. Various governmental entities are studying the title insurance product, market, pricing, and 
 8

business practices, and potential regulatory and legislative changes, which may materially affect our business and operations. From time to time, we are assessed fines for violations of regulations or other matters or enter into settlements with such authorities which may require us to pay fines or claims or take other actions. For further discussion, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings.
Before a person can acquire control of a U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state in which the insurer is domiciled. Prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer, the state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the integrity and management of the applicant’s Board of Directors and executive officers, the acquirer’s plans for the insurer’s Board of Directors and executive officers, the acquirer’s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control. Generally, state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10% or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer. Because a person acquiring 10% or more of our common shares would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of our insurers, the insurance change of control laws would likely apply to such a transaction.
 The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") has adopted an instruction requiring an annual certification of reserve adequacy by a qualified actuary. Because all of the states in which our title insurers are domiciled require adherence to NAIC filing procedures, each such insurer, unless it qualifies for an exemption, must file an actuarial opinion with respect to the adequacy of its reserves.
Title Insurance Ratings. Our title insurance underwriters are regularly assigned ratings by independent agencies designed to indicate their financial condition and/or claims paying ability. The rating agencies determine ratings by quantitatively and qualitatively analyzing financial data and other information. Our title subsidiaries include Alamo Title, Chicago Title, Commonwealth Land Title, Fidelity National Title and National Title of New York. Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) provide ratings for the entire FNF family of companies as a whole as follows:

 | S&P | Moody’s
FNF family of companies | A | A2 

The relative position of each of our ratings among the ratings scale assigned by each rating agency is as follows:

• | An S&P "A" rating is the third highest rating of 12 ratings for S&P. According to S&P, an insurer rated “A” has strong capacity to meet its financial commitments, but is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than insurers with "AAA" or "AA" ratings. 


• | A Moody's "A2" rating is the third highest rating of 9 ratings for Moody's. Moody's states that companies rated “A2” are judged to be upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk. 

Demotech provides financial strength/stability ratings for each of our title insurance underwriters individually, as follows: 
Alamo Title Insurance | A' 
Chicago Title Insurance Company | A''
Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company | A' 
Fidelity National Title Insurance Company | A' 
National Title Insurance of New York | A' 

 Demotech states that its ratings of "A"(A double prime)" and "A' (A prime)" reflect its opinion that the insurer possesses "Unsurpassed" ability to maintain liquidity of invested assets, quality reinsurance, acceptable financial leverage and realistic pricing while simultaneously establishing loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at reasonable levels. The A'' and A' ratings are the two highest ratings of Demotech's six ratings. 
The ratings of S&P, Moody’s, and Demotech described above are not designed to be, and do not serve as, measures of protection or valuation offered to investors. These financial strength ratings should not be relied on with respect to making an investment in our securities. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — If the rating agencies downgrade our Company, our results of operations and competitive position in the title insurance industry may suffer” for further information.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal security practices, and copyright and trade secret law to establish and protect our software, technology, and expertise across our businesses. Further, we have developed a number of brands that have accumulated substantial goodwill in the marketplace, and we rely on trademark law to protect our rights in that area. We 
 9

intend to continue our policy of taking all measures we deem necessary to protect our copyright, trade secret, and trademark rights. These legal protections and arrangements afford only limited protection of our proprietary rights, and there is no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop or license products, services, or capabilities that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours.
Technology and Research and Development
 As a national provider of real estate transaction products and services, we participate in an industry that is subject to significant regulatory requirements, frequent new product and service introductions, and evolving industry standards. We believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate industry changes and offer products and services that meet evolving industry standards. In connection with our title segment service offerings, we are continuing to deploy new information system technologies to our direct and agency operations. We continue to improve the process of ordering title and escrow services and improve the delivery of our products to our customers. In order to meet new regulatory requirements, we also continue to expand our data collection and reporting abilities.
Investment Policies and Investment Portfolio
 Our investment policy is designed to maximize total return through investment income and capital appreciation consistent with moderate risk of principal, while providing adequate liquidity. Our insurance subsidiaries, including title insurers, underwritten title companies and insurance agencies, are subject to extensive regulation under applicable state laws. The various states in which we operate our underwriters regulate the types of assets that qualify for purposes of capital, surplus, and statutory unearned premium reserves. Our investment policy specifically limits duration and non-investment grade allocations in the FNF fixed-income portfolio. Maintaining shorter durations on the investment portfolio allows for the mitigation of interest rate risk. Equity securities and preferred stock are utilized to take advantage of perceived value or for strategic purposes. Due to the magnitude of the investment portfolio in relation to our claims loss reserves, durations of investments are not specifically matched to the cash outflows required to pay claims.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the carrying amount of total investments, which approximates the fair value, excluding investments in unconsolidated affiliates, was $3.4 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively.
 We purchase investment grade fixed maturity securities, selected non-investment grade fixed maturity securities, preferred stock and equity securities. The securities in our portfolio are subject to economic conditions and normal market risks and uncertainties.
The following table presents certain information regarding the investment ratings of our fixed maturity securities and preferred stock portfolio at December 31, 2018 and 2017:

The following table presents certain information regarding contractual maturities of our fixed maturity securities:

 | December 31, 2018 
 | Amortized | | % of | | Fair | | % of 
Maturity | Cost | | Total | | Value | | Total
 | (Dollars in millions)
One year or less | $ | 347 | | | 17.3 | % | | $ | 344 | | 17.2 | %
After one year through five years | 1,336 | | | 66.6 | | | 1,326 | | | 66.3
After five years through ten years | 226 | | | 11.2 | | | 227 | | | 11.4

 | $ | 2,009 | | | 100.0 | % | | $ | 1,998 | | 100.0 | %

 Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Because of the potential for prepayment on mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, they are not categorized by contractual maturity.
Our equity securities at December 31, 2018 and 2017 consisted of investments with a cost basis of $498 million and $517 million, respectively, and fair value of $498 million and $681 million, respectively. 
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we held $137 million and $150 million, respectively, in investments that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
 As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, other long-term investments were $135 million and $110 million, respectively. Other long-term investments include other investments carried at fair value and company-owned life insurance policies carried at cash surrender value.
 Short-term investments, which consist primarily of commercial paper and money market instruments which have an original maturity of one year or less, are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, short-term investments amounted to $480 million and $295 million, respectively.
Our investment results for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:

______________________________________

(1) | Net investment income as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings has been adjusted in the presentation above to provide the tax equivalent yield on tax exempt investments and to exclude interest earned on cash and cash equivalents. Net investment income includes fees earned by holding customer funds in escrow (off-balance sheet) during facilitation of tax-deferred property exchanges. See Note D Investments to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for a detail of our interest income.

Loss Reserves
 For information about our loss reserves, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Estimates.
Geographic Operations
Our direct title operations are divided into approximately 180 profit centers. Each profit center processes title insurance transactions within its geographical area, which is usually identified by a county, a group of counties forming a region, or a state, depending on the management structure in that part of the country. We also transact title insurance business through a network of approximately 5,200 agents, primarily in those areas in which agents are the more prevalent title insurance provider. Substantially all of our revenues are generated in the United States.

 Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information
 The statements contained in this Form 10-K or in our other documents or in oral presentations or other statements made by our management that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including statements regarding our expectations, hopes, intentions, or strategies regarding the future. These statements relate to, among other things, future financial and operating results of the Company. In many cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these statements as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to the following:

• | changes in general economic, business, and political conditions, including changes in the financial markets;


• | the severity of our title insurance claims;


• | downgrade of our credit rating by rating agencies;


• | adverse changes in the level of real estate activity, which may be caused by, among other things, high or increasing interest rates, a limited supply of mortgage funding, increased mortgage defaults, or a weak U.S. economy;


• | compliance with extensive government regulation of our operating subsidiaries and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations or in their application by regulators;


• | inability to obtain without unanticipated conditions or significant delay, if at all, the necessary regulatory approvals to consummate the Stewart Merger;


• | inability to timely satisfy or obtain waiver any of the closing conditions to the proposed Stewart Merger;


• | failure to successfully integrate Stewart’s business with that of FNF, that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that the expected benefits of the Stewart Merger will not be realized;


• | regulatory investigations of the title insurance industry;


• | loss of key personnel that could negatively affect our financial results and impair our operating abilities;


• | our business concentration in the States of California and Texas are the source of approximately 13.9% and 14.4%, respectively, of our title insurance premiums;


• | our potential inability to find suitable acquisition candidates, as well as the risks associated with acquisitions in lines of business that will not necessarily be limited to our traditional areas of focus, or difficulties integrating acquisitions;


• | our dependence on distributions from our title insurance underwriters as our main source of cash flow;


• | competition from other title insurance companies; and


• | other risks detailed in "Risk Factors" below and elsewhere in this document and in our other filings with the SEC.

 We are not under any obligation (and expressly disclaim any such obligation) to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should carefully consider the possibility that actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements.
