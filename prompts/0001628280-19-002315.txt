Overview of Our Company

Cross Country Healthcare, Inc. (NASDAQ: CCRN) is a national leader in providing healthcare staffing, recruiting and value-added workforce solutions. Through a full suite of innovative workforce solutions and a national presence including 73 office locations throughout the United States (U.S.), we are able to meet the unique and dynamic needs of our clients. By utilizing our various solutions, clients are able to better plan their personnel needs, outsource recruitment processes, strategically flex their workforce, access quality healthcare personnel, and provide continuity of care for improved patient outcomes. 
Our solutions are geared towards assisting our clients in maintaining high quality outcomes by addressing their healthcare workforce needs. We are increasingly being called upon by our clients to provide more creative and strategic talent sourcing strategies with respect to nurses, doctors, allied healthcare professionals, and healthcare executives, all on a temporary and permanent basis. Over the past several years, our workforce solutions have evolved into a total talent management relationship as our clients continue to focus on improving labor management to address complex financial, compliance, and other challenges in the healthcare industry. As part of this evolution of our services, we continue to consider the following: (1) solving the immediate and future needs of our customers and healthcare professionals; (2) enhancing our network of healthcare professionals and deepening our relationship with them; (3) expanding our service offerings to reduce sensitivity to economic cycles; (4) expanding our expertise with various healthcare solutions in various geographic areas of the U.S. and (5) continuing to diversify our client base to enhance our long-term business prospects. Today, our workforce solutions include:

• | Managed Service Programs (MSPs). The market has continued to shift towards a centralized model for managing contingent labor for both clinical and non-clinical needs. We have been a market leader in this area since launching our first MSP in 2003, an account we continue to serve today. Over the past 15 years, we have grown our relationships and today service more than 70 clients across more than 900 facilities, with estimated spend under management of approximately $400 million annually. The benefits to our clients not only include reduced costs and increased visibility into their needs and usage, but they gain access and insight from our industry expertise on a broad range of topics. In 2017, we acquired Advantage RN, LLC (Advantage) to supplement the number of nurses we place at our MSP clients, increase our capture rate at those accounts, and reduce the number of positions we outsource to subcontractors. In addition, Advantage provides a vehicle for us to cross-sell our MSP solutions to Advantage's clients and increase our footprint in the Midwest where Advantage is located. 


• | Optimal Workforce Solutions (OWS). The acquisition of Medical Staffing Network in 2014 provided us with a platform to provide outsourced services to large hospital systems to more efficiently manage certain professionals.

• | Education Healthcare Staffing Services. In 2015, we acquired an education healthcare staffing company, Mediscan, which further diversified our customer base to staff speech language pathologists, physical therapists, and other healthcare workers in schools (public, charter and private) as mandated by the government. This business serves to reduce our sensitivity to economic cycles. 


• | Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO). In 2016, we acquired an RPO business, US Resources Healthcare, which allows us to deliver financial and operating efficiencies to our customers through labor optimization services while enhancing the quality of care. In 2018, we acquired American Personnel, Inc. (AP Staffing) which also provides RPO services in addition to other strategic solutions. 


• | Internal Resource Pool Consulting & Development (IRP). We strategically partner with our clients to set up, administer and manage an IRP or to optimize an existing IRP to create efficiencies for our clients by balancing their workforce mix to meet their current needs. 


• | Electronic Medical Record Transition Staffing (EMR). As healthcare facilities continue to enhance and optimize their electronic medical record technology, we provide a staffing plan and an organized volume of quality healthcare professionals during the process so that our clients may continue to deliver quality care. 


• | Consulting Services. In 2018, we acquired AP Staffing located in Boston. In addition to providing temporary and permanent staffing solutions and MSP solutions, AP Staffing acts as a consultative partner with clients to perform, among other things, talent acquisition assessments, the development of requests for proposals, the management of vendor selection processes, and employer branding strategies. 

Through a combination of our national reach and industry leading local presence in key markets, we are able to place clinical and non-clinical professionals across a diverse customer base. We believe that our branches provide a unique value proposition to both large and small clients alike as we are able to offer them a high-touch, consultative based approach to understanding the market on both a national and local level. Our acquisition of Medical Staffing Network in 2014 expanded our local presence throughout the U.S. and provided a larger geographic footprint of 55 offices to provide per diem and local contract staffing and support MSP clients in those areas. In August 2018, Staffing Industry Analysts reported that Cross Country Healthcare was the largest per diem staffing company in the U.S. The acquisitions of Allied Health Group in 2013, Medical Staffing Network in 2014, Mediscan in 2015, Advantage in 2017, and American Personnel, Inc. (AP Staffing) in 2018 have expanded our recruiting capabilities and supply of nursing and allied professionals who desire to be engaged on a travel, per diem and/or permanent basis throughout the course of their careers.

We started centralizing our back office, including technology, human resource, finance, and risk management resources in 2013, and we continue to centralize these functions in order to streamline processes and create efficiencies in pursuit of growth and profitability. In an effort to further optimize our processes, from 2014 to 2016 we replaced the front office operating systems of our branch operations, our physician staffing business and our executive and physician search business. In 2018, we began a project to replace the front-end operating system of our travel nurse business to improve our candidate experience and be more efficient. As part of our growth strategy, we are also embracing the way content, messaging and communication generally are being consumed differently and we are continuing to make investments in social media, mobile applications and other technology which we believe will continue enhancing our recruiting capabilities and the experience of our healthcare professionals. These marketing and technology strategies to retain talent more efficiently should serve to give us more leverage in the business and make the company more user-friendly for our corporate employees, our healthcare professionals and our clients. 
We believe our strategy will allow us to expand our current business and capture rate at our MSP clients, increase the number and types of new customers we serve, grow the supply and types of specialties of our healthcare professionals, improve our operating leverage through growth and cost containment, and strengthen and broaden our market presence. This will require us to focus on (i) expanding our workforce solutions offerings to deepen our relationships with current customers and to attract new customers; (ii) expanding our local branch network to grow our local market presence and our MSP business; (iii) further diversifying our customer base into the public and charter school market; (iii) continuing to diversify and deepen our customer base in the local ambulatory care and retail market, which provides more balance between our large volume-based customers and our small local customers; (iv) better positioning ourselves to take additional market share in our MSP business; (v) accessing more candidates; and (vi) continuing to modernize our technologies and processes to optimize our relationships with our healthcare professionals and clients. 
To successfully execute our business strategy, we will rely on our experienced and focused executive and operational teams. Our executive team has extensive experience in the staffing and healthcare industries. We also foster a culture of performance, talented leadership and collegiality that promotes the achievement of both company and personal goals. In 2018, Cross Country Staffing® was recognized as Best of Staffing. Advantage RN, Cross Country Allied, Cross Country TravCorps, Medical Doctor Associates, Medical Staffing Network, MedStaff, PharmStaff all received 2018 Talent ClearlyRated Best of Staffing Awards.

Services
We provide our services on a national level or through any one of our 66 local branches throughout the United States or through a combination of both. We service a variety of clients, including public and private acute care hospitals, public and charter schools, outpatient clinics, ambulatory care facilities, single and multi-specialty physician practices, rehabilitation facilities, urgent care centers, correctional facilities, government facilities, retailers, and many other healthcare providers. 
Our business consists of three business segments: (i) Nurse and Allied Staffing; (ii) Physician Staffing; and (iii) Other Human Capital Management Services. Fees for our services are paid directly by our clients and in certain instances by vendor managers, and as a result, we have no direct exposure to Medicare or Medicaid reimbursements. For additional financial information concerning our business segments, see Note 17 - Segment Data to the consolidated financial statements. Through our business segments, we provide our healthcare clients with a wide range of workforce solutions as described above and staffing services as set forth below. 

(1) | Nursing and Allied Staffing. The Nurse and Allied Staffing segment provides workforce solutions and traditional staffing, including temporary and permanent placement of travel nurses and allied professionals, branch-based local nurses, and allied staffing. We provide flexible workforce solutions to the healthcare and school markets through diversified offerings designed to meet the special needs of each client, including: MSP, OWS, Educational Healthcare Services, RPO, IRP, EMR and consulting services. We market our services to hospitals and other customers through our Cross Country Staffing®, MSN, Allied Health Group, Advantage, Mediscan, AP Staffing, and DirectEd brands. We also market our services to healthcare professionals using a multi-brand strategy to segment the market and maximize our outreach to healthcare professionals. Our Nurse and Allied Staffing revenue and contribution income is set forth in Note 17 - Segment Data to the consolidated financial statements. 

A majority of our revenue is generated from staffing registered nurses on long-term contract assignments (typically 13 weeks in length) at hospitals and health systems using various brands. Additionally, we offer a short-term staffing solution of registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, certified nurse assistants, advanced practitioners, pharmacists, and more than 100 specialties of allied professionals on local per diem and short-term assignments in a variety of clinical and non-clinical settings through our national network of local branch offices. We also provide travel allied professionals on long-term contract assignments to hospitals, public and charter schools, and skilled nursing facilities under the Cross Country Staffing, Mediscan, and DirectEd brands.

(2) | Physician Staffing. We provide physicians in many specialties, certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), nurse practitioners (NPs), and physician assistants (PAs) under our MDA brand as independent contractors on temporary assignments throughout the United States at various healthcare facilities, such as acute and non-acute care facilities, medical group practices, government facilities, and managed care organizations. We recruit these professionals nationally and place them on assignments varying in length from several days up to one year. Our Physician Staffing revenue and contribution income is set forth in Note 17 - Segment Data to the consolidated financial statements.


(3) | Other Human Capital Management Services. We provide retained and contingent search services for physicians, healthcare executives, nurses, advanced practice, and allied health professionals. The revenue and contribution income of our Other Human Capital Management Services Segment is set forth in Note 17 - Segment Data to the consolidated financial statements. Our Cejka Search® brand recruits healthcare talent for organizations nationwide through a team of experienced professionals, advanced use of recruitment technology, and commitment to service excellence. Serving clients nationwide, Cejka completes hundreds of search assignments annually for organizations, including, but not limited to, physician group practices, hospitals and health systems, academic medical centers, accountable care organizations, managed care, and other healthcare organizations. 

Our Business Model
The recruitment and retention of a sufficient number of qualified healthcare professionals to work temporary assignments on our behalf is critical to the success of our business. Healthcare professionals choose temporary assignments for a variety of reasons that include seeking flexible work opportunities, exploring diverse practice settings, building skills and experience by working at prestigious healthcare facilities, avoiding the demands and political environment of working as permanent staff, working through life and career transitions, and as a means of access into a permanent staff position.

(1) | Our Healthcare Professionals. Within our Nurse and Allied segment, we operate differentiated brands to recruit nurses and allied professionals. We believe our multi-brand recruiting model helps us reach a larger volume and a more diverse group of candidates to fill open positions at our clients throughout the United States in various clinical and non-clinical settings and in many different geographic areas. Our company is well positioned, as nurses and allied professionals routinely seek a wide range of diverse assignments in attractive locations, with competitive compensation and benefit packages, scheduling options, as well as a high level of service. In addition, we believe nurses and allied professionals are confident we will have new assignments for them as they complete their current assignment. Our competitive benefits generally include professional liability insurance, a 401(k) plan, health insurance, reimbursed travel, per diem allowances, and housing. Each of our nurse and allied healthcare professionals is employed by us and is typically paid hourly wages and any other benefits they are entitled to receive during the assignment period.

Recruiters are an essential element of our Nurse and Allied Staffing business, and are responsible for establishing and maintaining key relationships with candidates for the duration of their assignments with us. Recruiters match the supply of qualified candidates in our databases with the demand for open orders posted by our clients. While we rely on word-of-mouth for referrals to access candidates, we also market our brands on the Internet, including extensive utilization of social media, which has become an increasingly important component of our recruitment efforts. We maintain a number of websites to allow potential applicants to obtain information about our brands and assignment opportunities, as well as to apply online.
MDA recruits and contracts with physicians and advanced practice professionals to provide medical services for its healthcare customers. Each physician or advanced practice professional is an independent contractor and enters into an agreement with MDA to provide medical services at a particular healthcare facility or physician practice group based on terms and conditions specified by that customer. Physicians and advanced practice professionals are engaged to provide medical services for a healthcare customer ranging from a few days up to a year. We believe physicians are attracted to us because we offer a wide variety of assignments, competitive fees, medical malpractice insurance, and a high level of service to them. MDA relies on word-of-mouth referrals, but also markets it brands on the Internet and through extensive social media campaigns.

(2) | Sales and Marketing. We market our Nurse and Allied Staffing services to our hospitals, healthcare facilities, schools, and other clients using our Cross Country Staffing, Medical Staffing Network™, Advantage, Allied Health Group, Mediscan, AP Staffing, and DirectEd brands. Cross Country Staffing typically contracts with our nurse and allied healthcare clients on behalf of itself and our other brands. Mediscan contracts with its hospitals, public schools, and charter schools under the Mediscan and DirectEd brands. Our traditional staffing includes temporary and permanent placement of travel nurses and allied professionals, branch-based local nurses and allied staffing, and physicians. We provide flexible workforce solutions to the healthcare and school markets through diversified offerings meeting the special needs of each client. Orders for open positions and other services are entered into our various databases and are available to recruiters. Account managers, who develop relationships with our clients to understand their specific settings and culture, submit candidate profiles to clients, and confirm offers and placements with them.

MDA markets its Physician Staffing operations to hospitals and other healthcare facilities throughout the U.S. Our recruiters use our extensive database of physicians and their expertise in their given specialties to contact physicians to schedule short and long-term engagements at healthcare customers. MDA operates a multi-site business model with employees at several locations.
Cejka markets its retained and contingent search services to healthcare clients primarily through industry professional organizations, direct marketing, its website, and by word-of-mouth.

(3) | Credentialing and Quality Management. We screen all of our candidates prior to placement through our credentialing departments. Our credentialing processes are designed to ensure that our professionals have the requisite skillsets required by our customers, as well as the aptitude to meet the day-to-day requirements and challenges they would typically encounter on assignments where they are placed. The credentialing of our nurse and allied healthcare professionals is designed to align with the guidelines of The Joint Commission, a national accrediting body, to ensure quality care. Our Cross Country University division, accredited by the American Nurse Credentialing Center, provides training, assessment, and professional development to further ensure the quality of the personnel we place on assignment. Our physician credentialing entity, Credent, is also certified by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA).

(4) | Payment for Services. We negotiate payment for services with our clients based on market conditions and needs. We generally bill our nurse and allied employees at an hourly rate which includes all employer costs, including payroll, withholding taxes, benefits, professional liability insurance, meals and incidentals, and other requirements, as well as any travel and housing arrangements, where applicable. Our shared service center processes hours worked by field employees in the time and attendance systems, which in turn generate the billable transactions to our clients. Hours worked by independent contractor physicians are reported to our MDA office. For our physician and executive search business, Cejka typically bills its clients a candidate acquisition fee and is reimbursed for certain marketing expenses.


(5) | Operations. Our Nurse and Allied and Physician Staffing businesses are operated through a relatively centralized business model servicing all assignment needs of our healthcare professional employees, physicians, and client healthcare facilities primarily through operation centers located in Boca Raton, Florida; Newtown Square, Pennsylvania; West Chester, Ohio; Woodland Hills, California; and Berkeley Lake, Georgia. In addition to the key sales and recruitment activities, certain of these centers also perform support activities such as coordinating housing, payroll processing, benefits administration, billing and collections, travel reimbursement processing, customer service, and risk management. Cejka Search primarily operates its business from its headquarters located in Creve Coeur, Missouri. This business operates relatively independently, other than certain ancillary services that are provided from our Boca Raton, Florida headquarters, such as payroll, legal, and information systems support. On December 31, 2018, we had 73 office locations.


(6) | Information Systems. Various information systems are utilized to run our customer relationship management, recruitment, and placement functions based on our different brands. Some of these sophisticated applications are proprietary and are hosted in Tier 1 hosting facilities while other systems are Software as a Service (SaaS) based and hosted by our vendor partners. Our systems maintain detailed information about our client required skillsets and status which assist us in enabling fulfillment and assignment renewals. Our databases contain an extensive pool of existing and potential customers and all related recruitment and sales activity. Our financial and human resource systems are managed on leading enterprise resource planning software suites that manage certain aspects of accounts payable, accounts receivable, general ledger, billing, and human capital management. All of our systems are managed by our onshore and offshore Information Technology team.


(7) | Risk Management, Insurance, and Benefits. We have developed a risk management program that requires prompt notification of incidents by clients, clinicians, and independent contractors, educational training to our employees, loss analysis, and prompt reporting procedures to reduce our risk of exposure. While we cannot predict the future, we continuously review facts and incidents associated with professional liability and workers’ compensation claims in order to identify trends and reduce our risk of loss in the future where possible. We consider assessments provided by our clients and we work with clinicians and experts from our insurance carriers to determine employment eligibility and potential exposure.

We provide workers’ compensation insurance coverage, professional liability coverage, and healthcare benefits for our eligible employed temporary professionals. We record our estimate of the ultimate cost of, and reserves for, workers' compensation and professional liability benefits based on actuarial models prepared or reviewed by an independent actuary using our loss history as well as industry statistics. In determining our reserves, we include reserves for estimated claims incurred but not reported. We also estimate on a quarterly basis the healthcare claims that have occurred but have not been reported based on our historical claim submission patterns. The ultimate cost of workers’ compensation, professional liability, and health insurance claims will depend on actual amounts incurred to settle those claims and may differ from the amounts reserved for such claims.
The Company maintains a number of insurance policies including general liability, workers’ compensation, fidelity, employment practices liability, fiduciary, directors and officers, cyber, property, and professional liability policies. These policies provide coverage subject to their terms, conditions, limits of liability, and deductibles, for certain liabilities that may arise from our operations. There can be no assurance that any of the above policies will be adequate for our needs, or that we will maintain all such policies in the future.
Our Geographic Markets and Client Base
In 2018, 2017 and 2016, all of our revenue was generated in the United States, and all of our long-lived assets were located in the United States and India. On a company-wide basis, we have approximately 7,500 active contracts with healthcare clients, and we provide our staffing services and workforce solutions in all 50 states. During 2018, the largest percentage of our revenue was concentrated in New York, Florida, and California. We provide services to public and private acute care hospitals, public and charter schools, outpatient clinics, ambulatory care facilities, single and multi-specialty physician practices, 
5

rehabilitation facilities, urgent care centers, correctional facilities, government facilities, retailers, and many other healthcare providers. In 2018, 2017, and 2016 no client accounted for more than 5% of our revenue. 
Our Industry

We compete in the U.S. temporary healthcare staffing and workforce solutions markets. Staffing Industry Analysts September 2018 report estimates the healthcare staffing markets in which we operate had an aggregate market size of $16.8 billion in 2018 of which $5.3 billion was travel nursing, $3.5 billion was per diem nursing, $4.0 billion was allied health and $4.0 billion was locum tenens and advanced practitioners. The demand for our services is impacted by many factors, however, we believe the most significant are the following: 
Industry Demand Drivers
Economic Backdrop. The U.S. economy had a strong year in 2018, and according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics the job market showed continued signs of continued growth with unemployment at 3.9% as of December 2018. The strong U.S. economy has led to solid job growth, which we expect will result in more individuals receiving healthcare from their employers - thus supporting the demand for healthcare services. A growing U.S. economy coupled with a low unemployment rate typically results in an increase in demand for our services 
Increased Need for Healthcare and Special Education Services in Schools. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), enacted in 1975, mandates that children and youth ages 3-21 with disabilities be provided a free and appropriate public school education. According to the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistic Report titled “The Condition of Education" (April 2018), the number of children and youth ages 3-21 receiving special education services was 6.7 million, or about 13% of traditional public and charter school enrollment. The IDEA requires that these children and young adults receive care from speech language pathologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, nurses and other healthcare professionals while at school. Based on the foregoing, we believe the demand for consulting and healthcare staffing services for public schools and charter schools will continue to be strong for agencies that can provide consulting services, healthcare personnel, technical assistance on policies, implementation, and training related to children and youth with special needs in school settings.
Creation of Healthcare Jobs Outpacing Other Industries and Occupations. Healthcare represented 14% of all jobs created in 2018 (HealthleadersMedia.com, January 4, 2019). According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, overall, employment is expected to grow 7.4%, far outpaced by employment in the healthcare industry (18%) and among healthcare occupations (18%) (Staffing Industry Analysts, December 14, 2017). This projected 18% growth varies, however, among three categories that make up the healthcare industry: (i) ambulatory healthcare services; (ii) nursing and residential care; and (iii) hospitals. Employment for ambulatory healthcare services is projected to grow 31%; nursing and residential care is projected to grow 13%, and hospital employment is projected to grow 6.8%. We expect the creation of additional jobs in the healthcare market will increase demand for our services as our temporary staff are typically hired to replace healthcare workers taking vacation and leaves of absence.
Outpatient/Ambulatory Settings Services Outpace Inpatient Services. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the ambulatory healthcare services sector added 37,800 jobs in December 2018, while hospitals added 7,400 jobs in the same. We believe certain government initiatives previously taken, such as Medicare reimbursement incentives for reduced readmissions, have had a direct correlation to the shift from inpatient services to outpatient/ambulatory settings and job growth in that area. We believe this growth will have a positive impact on demand for healthcare staffing services in outpatient/ambulatory settings.
Hospitals Seeking Efficiencies Through Various Workforce Solutions. Hospitals continue to face pressure to keep costs down. In addition, the national shift away from volume-based pricing to value-based pricing has continued. We believe these dynamics continue to put pressure on hospitals to find innovative solutions in order to better manage their workforce, which accounts for a large portion of their expenses. As a result, we believe healthcare facilities and providers will continue to utilize workforce solutions, such as MSP, RPO, IRP, and other talent management tools to help them solve these problems and maintain their quality of care. 
Macro Drivers of Demand. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) increased the number of insured patients over the past few years, especially in states that expanded Medicaid. It has been reported that the effect of the ACA on healthcare utilization has been that 20 million people gained health insurance coverage. However, the elimination of the individual mandate and other efforts by the current administration may negatively impact the number of individuals with health insurance coverage. In addition, two other long-term macro drivers of our business, a growing and aging U.S. population, should continue to drive demand for our services. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of 
6

persons aged 65 and over is expected to increase to 98 million in 2060, which is important because the utilization of healthcare services is generally higher among older people. 
Supply of Nurses. The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce (CEW) predicts a shortage of 192,620 nurses in 2020, which differs from the surplus of nurses predicted for 2025 by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) National Center for Health Workforce Analysis (Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce (CEW), Forecasts of Nursing Demand 2015). However, with healthcare now representing almost 20% of the U.S. economy, the aging of the U.S. population, and the expanded healthcare coverage under the ACA, both the CEW and HRSA agree that demand for healthcare services and healthcare workers will continue to grow. In addition, by 2030 it is expected that almost a million nurses will retire and leave the workforce taking with them the years of knowledge and experience they have accumulated (Modern Healthcare, Nursing Shortage In Perspective, January 1, 2018). There is also an imbalance of RNs at the state level where many states are projected to experience a smaller growth in RN supply relative to their state-specific demand, resulting in a geographical shortage of RNs by 2025. A shortfall of registered nurses in particular specialties is also expected over the next ten years (Georgetown University CEW, Forecasts of Nursing Demand 2015). We believe these geographic and specialty related shortages should have a positive effect on demand for our services as temporary nurse staffing orders typically increase when nurse vacancy rates rise.
Physician Shortage. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), the United States is expected to face a shortage of physicians over the next decade. The projections show a shortage ranging between 61,700 and 94,700 in 2025 as demand for physicians continues to outpace supply, according to AAMC, with a significant shortage showing among many surgical specialties. In addition, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), 44.1% of physicians in the U.S. is age 55 or older and nearing retirement and, while the number of applicants to U.S. medical schools is increasing, it is not expected to keep pace with expected future demand. This is a significant factor in the demand for locum tenens services.
Industry Competition
The workforce solutions and healthcare staffing industries are highly competitive. We compete on a national, regional, and local basis in both industries for healthcare clients and healthcare professionals. We are one of the largest providers in the U.S. of workforce solutions in the healthcare industry and nurse and allied healthcare staffing. In both of these industries, we compete with a few national competitors together with numerous smaller, regional, and local companies, particularly in the per diem business.
The principal competitive factors in attracting, retaining, and expanding business with healthcare clients nationally include: (i) understanding the client’s work environment; (ii) offering a comprehensive suite of services to assist the client in assessing its personnel needs and partnering with clients to design various customizable alternative solutions; (iii) the timely filling of clients' needs; (iv) price; (v) customer service; (vi) quality assurance and screening capabilities; (vii) risk management policies; (viii) insurance coverage; and (ix) general industry reputation. 
We believe we benefit competitively from the breadth and expertise of value-added workforce solutions that we offer. We also have the ability to meet a national shift towards a more integrated delivery of healthcare through our extensive branch network which allows us to assist hospitals and health systems turning to lower-cost, more accessible alternatives, such as outpatient or ambulatory care centers. By offering travel, per diem, and permanent placement of a variety of healthcare professionals, we are able to offer many different types of personnel to hospitals and health systems at their main campuses and their ambulatory and outpatient facilities. In addition, our joint venture with a large health system's staffing subsidiary provides us with a unique insight into the challenges facing many of our hospital clients generally and this provides us with the opportunity to better serve all of our clients by designing and implementing workforce solutions to meet their needs.
The principal competitive factors in attracting qualified healthcare professionals for temporary employment include: (i) a large national pool of desirable assignments; (ii) pay and benefits; (iii) speed of placements; (iv) customer service; (v) quality of accommodations; and (vi) overall industry reputation. We focus on retaining healthcare professionals by providing high-quality customer service, long-term benefits (to employees), and medical malpractice insurance.
From a candidate attraction standpoint, we have an extensive client base with hospitals and healthcare facilities, and other healthcare providers, throughout the U.S. As a result, we have a diverse choice of assignments for our healthcare professionals to choose from. Healthcare professionals apply with us through our differentiated nursing, locum tenens, and allied healthcare recruitment brands. Our local branch network also provides us access to local healthcare professionals who are uniquely qualified to provide care in ambulatory and outpatient settings. We believe our access to such a large and diverse group of healthcare professionals makes us more attractive to healthcare institutions and facilities seeking healthcare staffing and workforce solutions in the current dynamic marketplace. 
7

We believe we are one of only two large full-service healthcare staffing providers with a national footprint; one of the top five providers of physician staffing services in the U.S.; and one of the top providers of retained and contingent physician and healthcare executive search services in the healthcare marketplace. Some of our competitors in the workforce solutions, healthcare staffing, and search businesses include: AMN Healthcare Services, Inc., CHG Healthcare Services, Maxim Healthcare, Jackson Healthcare, Aya Healthcare, HealthTrust Workforce Solutions, and Witt Kiefer.
Certifications
The staffing businesses of our Cross Country Staffing, Medical Staffing Network, Mediscan, Advantage, and AP Staffing brands are certified by The Joint Commission under its Health Care Staffing Services Certification Program. In addition, Credent Verification and Licensing Services, a subsidiary of MDA, is certified by the NCQA.
Regulations
Our business is subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Complex federal and state laws and regulations govern, among other things, the licensure of professionals, the payment of our employees (e.g., wage and hour laws, employment taxes and income tax withholdings, etc.), and the operations of our business generally. We conduct business primarily in the U.S. and are subject to federal and state laws and regulations applicable to our business, which may be amended from time to time. Future federal and state legislation or interpretations thereof may require us to change our business practices. Compliance with all of these applicable rules and regulations require a significant amount of resources. We endeavor to be in compliance with all such rules and regulations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,750 corporate employees. During 2018, we employed an average of 7,154 full-time equivalent field employees in Nurse and Allied Staffing which does not include our Physician Staffing independent contractors, all of whom are not employees. During 2018, we became subject to a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 450 of our employees at OWS, LLC with Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union. We consider our relationship with employees to be good.
