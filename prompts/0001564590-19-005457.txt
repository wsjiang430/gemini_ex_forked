 Item 1. Business 
 W&T Offshore, Inc. is an independent oil and natural gas producer, active in the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico.  W&T Offshore, Inc. is a Texas corporation originally organized as a Nevada corporation in 1988, and successor by merger to W&T Oil Properties, Inc., a Louisiana corporation organized in 1983.  
 We have grown through acquisitions, exploration and development and currently hold working interests in 48 offshore fields in federal and state waters (47 producing and one field capable of producing).  We currently have under lease approximately 720,000 gross acres (390,000 net acres) spanning across the Outer Continental Shelf (“OCS”) off the coasts of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alabama, with approximately 515,000 gross acres on the conventional shelf and approximately 205,000 gross acres in the deepwater.  A majority of our daily production is derived from wells we operate.  We currently own interests in 123 offshore structures, 81 of which are located in fields that we operate.  We currently own interest in 201 productive wells, 135 of which we operate.  Our interest in fields, leases, structures and equipment are primarily owned by W&T Offshore, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiary, W & T Energy VI, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and through our proportionately consolidated interest in Monza Energy, LLC (“Monza”), as described in more detail in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 4 – Joint Venture Drilling Program under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K.    
 In managing our business, we are focused on optimizing production and increasing reserves in a profitable and prudent manner, while managing cash flows to meet our obligations and investment needs.  Our cash flows are materially impacted by the prices of commodities we produce (crude oil and natural gas, and the NGLs extracted from the natural gas).  In addition, the prices of goods and services used in our business can vary and impact our cash flows.  During 2018, average commodity realized prices improved from those we experienced during 2017 and 2016.  Our margins in 2018 improved from 2017 and 2016 levels, and were approximately the margin levels achieved prior to 2015.  We measure margins using adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, (“Adjusted EBITDA”) as a percent of revenue, which is a not a measurement under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).  We have historically increased our reserves and production through acquisitions, our drilling programs, and other projects that optimize production on existing wells.  While our production decreased 8.5% in 2018 from the prior year, we added 23.1 million barrels of oil equivalent (“MMBoe”) of proved reserves in 2018, replacing 174% of production. (MMBoe was computed on an equivalency ratio as described below.)  The 13.2% net increase in proved reserves year-over-year is a result of successful drilling, technical revisions driven by improved well performance, recompletion and workover efforts, and improved commodity prices.  During 2018, we completed one well which had reached target depth in 2017, and drilled and completed five additional wells which began producing during 2018. One of these wells, the Viosca Knoll 823 A-12 BP2, is currently offline and we are evaluating methods by which to enhance production at that well.
 The Gulf of Mexico is an area where we have developed significant technical expertise and where high production rates associated with hydrocarbon deposits have historically provided us the best opportunity to achieve a rapid return on our invested capital.  We have leveraged our experience in the conventional shelf (water depths of less than 500 feet) to develop higher impact capital projects in the Gulf of Mexico in both the deepwater (water depths in excess of 500 feet) and the deep shelf (well depths in excess of 15,000 feet and water depths of less than 500 feet).  We have acquired rights to explore and develop new prospects and existing oil and natural gas properties in both the deepwater and the deep shelf, while at the same time continuing our focus on the conventional shelf.  Our drilling efforts in recent years have included the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico.  The investment associated with drilling an offshore well and future development of an offshore project principally depends upon water depth, the depth of the well, the complexity of the geological formations involved and whether the well or project can be connected to existing infrastructure or will require additional investment in infrastructure.  Deepwater and deep shelf drilling projects can be substantially more capital intensive than those on the conventional shelf.  During 2018, we participated in the drilling and completion of three deepwater wells, and in 2016, we participated in the completion of one deepwater well.  
 During 2018, 2017 and 2016, our production volumes from deepwater fields were over 40% of our production.  One of our larger deepwater fields is the Big Bend field, which commenced production in late 2015.  Over 90% of our reserves in this field are composed of oil and NGLs on a barrel of oil equivalent (“Boe”) basis (computed on an equivalency ratio described below).  As of December 31, 2018, the Big Bend field was in our top ten fields based on reserves, net to our interest, on a Boe basis.

We generally sell our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas at the wellhead at current market prices or transport our production to “pooling points” where it is sold.  We are required to pay gathering and transportation costs with respect to a majority of our products.  Our products are marketed several different ways depending upon a number of factors, including the availability of purchasers at the wellhead, the availability and cost of pipelines near the well or related production platforms, the availability of third-party processing capacity, market prices, pipeline constraints and operational flexibility. 
 Based on a reserve report prepared by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”), our independent petroleum consultants, our total proved reserves at December 31, 2018 were 84.0 MMBoe compared to 74.2 MMBoe as of December 31, 2017.   Approximately 64% of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2018 were classified as proved developed producing, 16% as proved developed non-producing and 20% as proved undeveloped.  Classified by product, our proved reserves at December 31, 2018 were 46% crude oil, 12% NGLs and 42% natural gas.  These percentages and other energy-equivalent measurements stated in this Form 10-K were determined using the industry standard energy-equivalent ratio of six thousand cubic feet (“Mcf”) of natural gas to one barrel (“Bbl”) of crude oil, condensate or NGLs.  This energy-equivalent ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the energy-equivalent prices for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas may differ significantly.  Our total proved reserves had an estimated present value of future net revenues discounted at 10% (“PV-10”) of $1,439.8 million before consideration of cash outflows related to asset retirement obligations (“ARO”).  Our PV-10 after considering future cash outflows related to ARO was $1,260.5 million, and our standardized measure of discounted future cash flows was $1,067.0 million as of December 31, 2018.  Neither PV-10 nor PV-10 after ARO is a financial measure defined under GAAP.  For additional information about our proved reserves and a reconciliation of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, see Properties – Proved Reserves under Part I, Item 2 in this Form 10-K. 
 To provide additional financial flexibility, we created a drilling joint venture program with private investors during 2018 (the “JV Drilling Program”) and initiated drilling on several of the projects.  The JV Drilling Program enables W&T to receive returns on its investment on a promoted basis and enables private investors to participate in 14 drilling projects.  It also allows more projects to be taken on which leverages our capital expenditures and diversifies our risk.  During 2018, there were four wells in the JV Drilling Program that came on production.  In addition, as of December 31, 2018, one well was being drilled and one well was in the completion stage.  The current plan is to complete the 14 projects within a three-year period, but is subject to change as needed with any required approval of the other investors.  See Financial Statements and Supplementary Data –  Note 4 – Joint Venture Drilling Program under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information on the JV Drilling Program.  
 In October 2018, we entered into a series of transactions to effect a refinancing of substantially all of our outstanding indebtedness.  At that time, we issued $625.0 million of 9.75% Senior Second Lien Notes due 2023 (the “Senior Second Lien Notes”), which were issued at par with an interest rate of 9.75% per annum that matures on November 1, 2023.  Concurrently, we renewed our credit facility by entering into the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which matures on October 18, 2022 and increased the borrowing base from $150.0 million to $250.0 million.  The borrowing base is subject to scheduled semi-annual redeterminations to occur on or before May 15 and November 14 each calendar year, and certain additional redeterminations that may be requested at the discretion of either the lenders or the Company.  The Credit Agreement replaced the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Prior Credit Agreement”).  Funds from the Senior Second Lien Notes, cash on hand and borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to repurchase and retire, repay or redeem all of our previously outstanding secured senior notes and secured term loans.  The issuance of the Senior Second Lien Notes, execution of the Credit Agreement and extinguishment of the prior debt instruments are collectively referred to as the “Refinancing Transaction”.  The Refinancing Transaction reduced our debt levels, extended the maturities for our fixed rate debt and provided increased liquidity under the Credit Agreement through October 2022.  See Financial Statements and Supplementary Data –  Note 2 – Long-Term Debt under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for a full description of the transaction and the new debt instruments.

Our capital expenditure budget for 2019 of approximately $120.0 million is composed of select shelf and deepwater projects that, assuming success, would be placed on production within a few months after completion.  Our 2019 plans also include spending $25.0 million for ARO.  Based upon current price and production expectations for 2019, we believe that our cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations through year-end 2019 and build available cash balances; however, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables and additional capital expenditures may be required to more fully develop our properties.  We are also currently evaluating various acquisition opportunities, which, if successful, may increase our capital requirements in 2019 and beyond.  
 We continue to closely monitor current and forecasted commodity prices to assess what changes, if any, should be made to our 2019 plans.  See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources under Part II, Item 7 in this Form 10-K for additional information.  
 Business Strategy 
 Our goal is to pursue high rate of return projects and develop oil and natural gas resources that allow us to grow our production, reserves and cash flow in a capital efficient manner, thus enhancing the value of our assets.  We intend to execute the following elements of our business strategy in order to achieve this goal: 

• | Exploiting existing and acquired properties to add additional reserves and production;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exploring for reserves on our extensive acreage holdings;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | Acquiring reserves with substantial upside potential and additional leasehold acreage complementary to our existing acreage position at attractive prices; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continuing to manage our balance sheet in a prudent manner and continuing our track record of financial flexibility in any commodity price environment. Over time, we expect to de-lever through excess free cash flow generated by organic growth and accretive acquisitions. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition 
 The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive.  We currently operate in the Gulf of Mexico and compete for the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties and lease sales primarily on the basis of price for such properties.  We compete with numerous entities, including major domestic and foreign oil companies, other independent oil and natural gas companies and individual producers and operators.  Many of these competitors are large, well established companies that have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours and greater ability to provide the extensive regulatory financial assurances required for offshore properties.  Our ability to acquire additional oil and natural gas properties, acquire additional leases and to discover reserves in the future will depend upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties, finance investments and consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment.  
Oil and Natural Gas Marketing and Delivery Commitments
  We sell our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas to third-party customers.  We are not dependent upon, or contractually limited to, any one customer or small group of customers.  However, in 2018, approximately 30% of our revenues were to Shell Trading (US) Co., 20% to BP Products North America and 14% to Vitol Inc., with no other customer comprising greater than 10% of our 2018 revenues.  Due to the free trading nature of the oil and natural gas markets in the Gulf of Mexico, we do not believe the loss of a single customer or a few customers would materially affect our ability to sell our production.  We do not have any agreements which obligate us to deliver material quantities to third parties.

Regulation  
 General.  Various aspects of our oil and natural gas operations are subject to extensive and continually changing regulations as legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion.  Numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue, and have issued, rules and regulations binding upon the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members.  The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”), both agencies under the U.S. Department of the Interior (“DOI”), have adopted regulations pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (“OCSLA”) that apply to our operations on federal leases in the Gulf of Mexico.  
 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”) and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”).  In 1989, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, which removed all remaining price and nonprice controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas, effective January 1, 1993.  Sales by producers of natural gas and all sales of crude oil, condensate and NGLs can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices.  The FERC also regulates rates and service conditions for the interstate transportation of liquids, including crude oil, condensate and NGLs, under various statutes. 
 The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the FERC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) hold statutory authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities markets.  These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets.  We are required to observe the market-related regulations enforced by these agencies with regard to our physical sales of crude oil or other energy commodities, and any related hedging activities that we undertake.  Any violation of the FTC, FERC, and CFTC prohibitions on market manipulation can result in substantial civil penalties amounting to over $1.0 million per violation per day.    
 These departments and agencies have substantial enforcement authority and the ability to grant and suspend operations, and to levy substantial penalties for non-compliance.  Failure to comply with such regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 Federal leases.  Most of our offshore operations are conducted on federal oil and natural gas leases in the OCS waters of the Gulf of Mexico.  These leases are awarded by the BOEM based on competitive bidding and contain relatively standardized terms.  These leases require compliance with the BOEM, the BSEE, and other government agency regulations and orders that are subject to interpretation and change.  The BSEE also regulates the plugging and abandonment of wells located on the OCS and, following cessation of operations, the removal or appropriate abandonment of all production facilities, structures and pipelines on the OCS (collectively, these activities are referred to as “decommissioning”), while the BOEM governs financial assurance requirements associated with those decommissioning obligations.  
 Decommissioning and financial assurance requirements.  The BOEM requires that lessees demonstrate financial strength and reliability according to its regulations and provide acceptable financial assurances to assure satisfaction of lease obligations, including decommissioning activities on the OCS.  In 2016, the BOEM issued Notice to Lessees and Operators (“NTL”) #2016-N01 (“NTL #2016-N01”) to clarify the procedures and guidelines that BOEM Regional Directors use to determine if and when additional financial assurances may be required for OCS leases, rights of way (“ROWs”) and rights of use and easement (“RUEs”).  NTL #2016-N01 became effective in September 2016, but the BOEM has since extended indefinitely the start date for implementation.  This extension currently remains in effect; however, the BOEM reserved the right to re-issue liability orders in the future, including if it determines there is a substantial risk of nonperformance of the interest holder’s decommissioning liabilities.  See Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for more discussion on decommissioning and financial assurance requirements. 
 Reporting of decommissioning expenditures.  During late 2015, the BSEE issued a final rule requiring lessees to submit summaries of actual expenditures for decommissioning of wells, platforms, and other facilities required under the BSEE’s existing regulations.  The BSEE has reported that it will use this summary information to better estimate future decommissioning costs, and the BOEM typically relies upon the BSEE’s estimates to set the amount of required bonds or other forms of financial security in order to minimize the government’s perceived risk of potential decommissioning liability.

“Unbundling.”  The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (the “ONRR”) has publicly announced an “unbundling” initiative to revise the methodology employed by producers in determining the appropriate allowances for transportation and processing costs that are permitted to be deducted in determining royalties under Federal oil and gas leases.  The ONRR’s initiative requires re-computing allowable transportation and processing costs using revised guidance from the ONRR going back 84 months for every gas processing plant utilized during that period.  
 Regulation and transportation of natural gas.  Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation.  The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive regulation.  The FERC has undertaken various initiatives to increase competition within the natural gas industry.  As a result of initiatives like FERC Order No. 636, issued in 1992, the interstate natural gas transportation and marketing system allows non-pipeline natural gas sellers, including producers, to effectively compete with interstate pipelines for sales to local distribution companies and large industrial and commercial customers.  The most significant provisions of Order No. 636 require that interstate pipelines provide firm and interruptible transportation service on an open access basis that is equal for all natural gas supplies.  In many instances, the results of Order No. 636 and related initiatives have been to substantially reduce or eliminate the interstate pipelines’ traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas in favor of providing only storage and transportation services.  The rates for such storage and transportation services are subject to FERC ratemaking authority, and FERC exercises its authority either by applying cost-of-service principles or granting market based rates.  Similarly, the natural gas pipeline industry is subject to state regulations, which may change from time to time.  
 The OCSLA, which is administered by the BOEM and the FERC, requires that all pipelines operating on or across the OCS provide open access, non-discriminatory transportation service.  One of the FERC’s principal goals in carrying out OCSLA’s mandate is to increase transparency in the OCS market, to provide producers and shippers assurance of open access service on pipelines located on the OCS, and to provide non-discriminatory rates and conditions of service on such pipelines.  The BOEM issued a final rule, effective August 2008, which implements a hotline, alternative dispute resolution procedures, and complaint procedures for resolving claims of having been denied open and nondiscriminatory access to pipelines on the OCS. 
 In 2007, the FERC issued rules (“Order 704”) requiring that any market participant, including a producer such as us, that engages in wholesale sales or purchases of natural gas that equal or exceed 2.2 million British thermal units (“MMBtu”) during a calendar year must annually report such sales and purchases to the FERC to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices.  It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704.  Order 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers, and if so, whether their reporting complies with FERC’s policy statement on price reporting.  These rules are intended to increase the transparency of the wholesale natural gas markets and to assist the FERC in monitoring such markets and in detecting market manipulation. 
 Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, the FERC, state legislatures, state commissions and the courts.  The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated.  As a result, there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach pursued by the FERC, Congress and the states will continue. 
 While these federal and state regulations for the most part affect us only indirectly, they are intended to enhance competition in natural gas markets.  We cannot predict what further action the FERC, the BOEM or state regulators will take on these matters.  However, we do not believe that any such action taken will affect us differently, in any material way, than other natural gas producers with which we compete. 
 Oil and NGLs transportation rates.  Our sales of liquids, which include crude oil, condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are transacted at market prices.  In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction.  The price we receive from the sale of crude oil and NGLs is affected by the cost of transporting those products to market.  Interstate transportation rates for crude oil, condensate, NGLs and other products are regulated by the FERC.  In general, interstate crude oil, condensate and NGL pipeline rates must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. The FERC has established an indexing system for such transportation, which generally allows such pipelines to take an annual inflation-based rate increase. 
 5


In other instances, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to regulation by state regulatory bodies under state statutes and regulations.  As it relates to intrastate crude oil, condensate and NGL pipelines, state regulation is generally less rigorous than the federal regulation of interstate pipelines.  State agencies have generally not investigated or challenged existing or proposed rates in the absence of shipper complaints or protests, which are infrequent and are usually resolved informally.  We do not believe that the regulatory decisions or activities relating to interstate or intrastate crude oil, condensate or NGL pipelines will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they affect other crude oil, condensate and NGL producers or marketers. 
 Regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production.  Our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels.  Such regulations include requiring permits, bonds and pollution liability insurance for the drilling of wells, regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling, casing, operating, plugging and abandoning wells, and governing the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled.  Many states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation of oil and gas resources, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells and the regulation of spacing of such wells. 
 Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico can have a significant impact on oil and gas operations on the OCS.  The effects from past hurricanes have included structural damage to fixed production facilities, semi-submersibles and jack-up drilling rigs.  The BOEM and the BSEE continue to be concerned about the loss of these facilities and rigs as well as the potential for catastrophic damage to key infrastructure and the resultant pollution from future storms.  In an effort to reduce the potential for future damage, the BOEM and the BSEE have periodically issued guidance aimed at improving platform survivability by taking into account environmental and oceanic conditions in the design of platforms and related structures.  
 Environmental Regulations
General.  We are subject to complex and stringent federal, state and local environmental laws.  These laws, among other things, govern the issuance of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and producing operations, the amounts and types of materials that may be released into the environment, the discharge and disposal of waste materials, the remediation of contaminated sites and the reclamation and abandonment of wells, sites and facilities.  Numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws, which are often costly to comply with, and a failure to comply may result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures, the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, or development or expansion of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas.  Some laws, rules and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict joint and several liability for environmental contamination, rendering a person liable for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person.  Other laws, rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise exist or even prohibit exploration and production activities in sensitive areas.  In addition, state laws often require various forms of remedial action to prevent and address pollution, such as the closure of inactive oil and gas waste pits and the plugging of abandoned wells.  The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability.  The cost of remediation, reclamation and decommissioning, including abandonment of wells, platforms and other facilities in the Gulf of Mexico is significant.  These costs are considered a normal, recurring cost of our on-going operations.  Our competitors are subject to the same laws and regulations.  
  Hazardous Substances and Wastes.  The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, (“CERCLA”) imposes liability, without regard to fault, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment.  These persons include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances.  Under CERCLA, such persons are subject to strict joint and several liability for the cost of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the cost of certain health studies.  
 6


The federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”), regulates the generation, transportation, storage, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes and can require cleanup of hazardous waste disposal sites.  RCRA currently excludes drilling fluids, produced waters and certain other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas from regulation as “hazardous waste,” and the disposal of such oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes is regulated under less onerous non-hazardous waste requirements, usually under state law.  From time to time, however, various environmental groups have challenged the Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) exemption of certain oil and gas wastes from RCRA.  For example, following the filing of a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in May 2016 by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency’s failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and gas wastes, the EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a consent decree issued by the District Court on December 28, 2016.  Under the decree, the EPA must propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary.  If the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and gas waste regulations, the consent decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021.  Standards have been developed under RCRA and/or state laws for worker protection; treatment, storage, and disposal of Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (“NORM”) and NORM waste; management of NORM-contaminated waste piles, containers and tanks; and limitations on the relinquishment of NORM contaminated land for unrestricted use.  Historically, we have not incurred any material expenditures in connection with our compliance with existing RCRA and applicable state laws related to NORM waste. 
 Air Emissions and Climate Change.  Air emissions from our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, as amended (“CAA”), and comparable state and local requirements.  We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.  For example, in 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ground level ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion.  In 2017 and 2018, the EPA issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone as either “attainment/unclassifiable,” “unclassifiable” or “non-attainment.”  
 In the absence of federal legislation limiting greenhouse gases (“GHG”) emissions, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment, and it has adopted regulations that, among other things, restrict emissions of GHG under existing provisions of the CAA and may require the installation of control technologies to limit emissions of GHG.  For example, in June 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing new source performance standards that require new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions.  The 2016 rule would apply to any new or significantly modified facilities that we construct in the future that would otherwise emit large volumes of GHG together with other criteria pollutants.  However, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay certain portions of the 2016 rule for two years but the rule was not finalized.  Rather, in February 2018, the EPA finalized amendments to certain requirements of the 2016 final rule, and in September 2018, the EPA proposed additional amendments, including rescission of certain requirements and revisions to other requirements, such as fugitive emission monitoring frequency.  Also, certain of our operations are subject to EPA rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified offshore production sources.

Water Discharges.  The primary federal law for oil spill liability is the Oil Pollution Act (the “OPA”) which amends and augments oil spill provisions of the federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”).  OPA imposes certain duties and liabilities on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening United States waters, including the OCS or adjoining shorelines.  A liable “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge or, in the case of offshore facilities, the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging facility is located.  OPA assigns joint and several, strict liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for all containment and oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil and natural resource damages and economic damages suffered by persons adversely affected by an oil spill.  Although defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA, they are limited.  In January 2018, the BOEM raised OPA’s damages liability cap to $137.7 million; however, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct, resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation, or if the party failed to report a spill or cooperate fully in the cleanup.  OPA requires owners and operators of offshore oil production facilities to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility to cover costs that could be incurred in responding to an oil spill, and to prepare and submit for approval oil spill response plans.  These oil spill response plans must detail the action to be taken in the event of a spill; identify contracted spill response equipment, materials, and trained personnel; and identify the time necessary to deploy these resources in the event of a spill.  In addition, OPA currently requires a minimum financial responsibility demonstration of between $35 million and $150 million for companies operating on the OCS.  We are currently required to demonstrate, on an annual basis, that we have ready access to $150 million that can be used to respond to an oil spill from our facilities on the OCS.  
 The Clean Water Act and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the monitoring and discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other natural gas wastes, into federal and state waters.  The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency.  The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges.  The treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from our onshore gas processing plant may have significant costs.  Obtaining permits has the potential to delay, restrict or cancel the development of oil and natural gas projects.  These same regulatory programs also limit the total volume of water that can be discharged, hence limiting the rate of development, and require us to incur compliance costs.  Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as “SPCC plans,” in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil.  
 Marine Protected Areas and Endangered and Threatened Species.  Executive Order 13158, issued in May 2000, directs federal agencies to safeguard existing Marine Protected Areas (“MPAs”) in the United States and establish new MPAs.  The order requires federal agencies to avoid harm to MPAs to the extent permitted by law and to the maximum extent practicable.  It also directs the EPA to propose new regulations under the Clean Water Act to ensure appropriate levels of protection for the marine environment.  In addition, Federal Lease Stipulations include regulations regarding the taking of protected marine species (sea turtles, marine mammals, Gulf sturgeon and other listed marine species).  
 Certain flora and fauna that have been officially classified as “threatened” or “endangered” are protected by the federal Endangered Species Act, as amended (“ESA”).  This law prohibits any activities that could “take” a protected plant or animal or reduce or degrade its habitat area.  We conduct operations on leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA may exist. During 2017, we reached an agreement with the various governmental agencies to remove the topside structure on our non-producing platform located in a National Marine Sanctuary in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and leave the bottom of the platform structure below the water line in place.  The project was completed during 2018 and allows the marine growth attached to and around the structure to remain and continue to grow.  As a result, we are subject to additional federal regulation, including regulations issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Unique regulations related to operations in a sanctuary include prohibition of drilling activities within certain protected areas, restrictions on the types of water and other substances that may be discharged, required depths of discharge in connection with drilling and production activities and limitations on mooring of vessels.

Other federal statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and which may apply to our operations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the National Historic Preservation Act.  These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and may limit or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness or wetlands.  These and other protected areas may require certain mitigation measures to avoid harm to wildlife, and such laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.  The permits required for our various operations are subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities.  
 Financial Information
 We operate our business as a single segment. See Selected Financial Data under Part II, Item 6 and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for our financial information.
 Seasonality 
 Generally, the demand for and price of natural gas increases during the winter months and decreases during the summer months.  However, these seasonal fluctuations are somewhat reduced because during the summer, pipeline companies, utilities, local distribution companies and industrial users purchase and place into storage facilities a portion of their anticipated winter requirements of natural gas.  As utilities continue to switch from coal to natural gas, some of this seasonality has been reduced as natural gas is used for both heating and cooling.  In addition, the demand for oil is higher in the winter months, but does not fluctuate seasonally as much as natural gas.  Seasonal weather changes affect our operations.  Tropical storms and hurricanes occur in the Gulf of Mexico during the summer and fall, which require us to evacuate personnel and shut in production until the storm subsides.  Also, periodic storms during the winter often impede our ability to safely load, unload and transport personnel and equipment, which delays the installation of production facilities, thereby delaying production and sales of our oil and natural gas. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed 282 people.  We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages.  We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
