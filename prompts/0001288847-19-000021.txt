ITEM 1. Business
Overview 
Five9 is a pioneer and leading provider of cloud software for contact centers. Since our inception, we have exclusively focused on delivering our platform in the cloud and are disrupting a significantly large market by replacing legacy on-premise contact center systems. Contact centers are vital hubs of interaction between organizations and their customers and, therefore, are essential to delivering successful customer service, sales and marketing strategies. Our mission is to empower organizations to transform their contact centers into customer engagement centers of excellence, while improving business agility and significantly lowering the cost and complexity of their contact center operations. Our purpose-built, highly scalable and secure Virtual Contact Center, or VCC, cloud platform delivers a comprehensive suite of easy-to-use applications that enable the breadth of contact center-related customer service, sales and marketing functions. We have become an established leader in the cloud contact center market, facilitating more than five billion call minutes between our more than 2,000 clients and their customers per year. We believe our ability to combine software and telephony into a single unified platform that is delivered in the cloud creates a significant advantage. 
Based on our current product offering and historical average annual recurring revenue per seat, we believe that the market for our solution is approximately $24 billion annually worldwide. Gartner, Inc., or Gartner, estimated that there are approximately 15.8 million contact center agents worldwide. Furthermore, we believe cloud penetration of the contact center market in North America is between 10% to 15%. We believe adoption of cloud contact center software solutions is increasing rapidly as a result of several distinct trends. The increasing adoption of cloud computing, especially within customer relationship management, or CRM, is creating strong demand for integrated cloud contact center software solutions. In addition, cloud contact center software solutions now offer the functionality required by large, complex enterprise contact centers. Furthermore, we believe organizations typically refresh their contact center systems every 8 to 10 years, which provides an opportunity for cloud solutions to replace legacy on-premise contact center systems when these replacement decisions arise. On-premise systems require large up-front investments, long deployment cycles and are burdensome to maintain. These systems are also often inflexible, complex, and require significant duplication of effort and integration across multiple sites. This creates substantial challenges for clients with on-premise contact center systems to implement new features or upgrades, or to integrate with adjacent cloud solutions. As a result, cloud contact center software solutions are replacing legacy on-premise contact center systems. 
Our solution, which is comprised of our Virtual Contact Center, or VCC, cloud platform and applications, allows simultaneous management and optimization of customer interactions across voice, chat, email, web, social media and mobile channels, either directly or through our application programming interfaces, or APIs. Our VCC cloud platform matches each customer interaction with an appropriate agent resource and delivers relevant customer data to the agent in real-time through integrations with adjacent enterprise applications, such as CRM software, to optimize the customer experience and improve agent productivity. Our solution ensures our clients always have the latest version of our software. Delivered on-demand, our solution enables our clients to quickly deploy agent seats in any geographic location with only a computer, headset and broadband internet connection, and rapidly adjust the number of contact center agent seats in response to changing business requirements. Unlike legacy on-premise contact center systems, our solution requires minimal up-front investment, can be rapidly deployed and is maintained by us in the cloud. 
Our sales model consists of a field sales team that sells our solution into larger opportunities and a telesales team that sells our solution into smaller opportunities. We have developed a proven, high velocity, metrics-driven sales and marketing strategy, which is designed to effectively identify, qualify and close sales opportunities. To complement this go-to-market strategy, we have developed a large ecosystem of technology and system integrator partners and independent software vendors to help increase awareness of our solution in the market and drive incremental sales opportunities with new and existing clients. We have also established, and are continuing to increase, our network of master sales agents, which provide sales leads and resellers that sell our solution to new and existing clients. This network has helped us attract additional clients. Our resellers have assisted us, and we expect they will continue to assist us, in expanding internationally.
4

We provide our solution through a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, business model with recurring subscriptions based primarily on the number of agent seats and minutes of usage, as well as the specific functionalities and applications our clients deploy. 
We have achieved significant growth in recent periods. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our revenues were $257.7 million, $200.2 million and $162.1 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 29% and 24%, respectively. We incurred net losses of $0.2 million, $9.0 million and $11.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as a result of increased investment in our growth. As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our total assets were $394.7 million, $128.2 million and $105.2 million, respectively. Our recurring revenue model combined with our Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate, which was 103% as of December 31, 2018, have enhanced our ability to forecast our financial performance and plan future investments. For a description of how our Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate is calculated, please refer to ITEM 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We operate in a single reportable segment. Please refer to the geographical information for each of the last three years in Note 11 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Please refer to the discussion of risks related to our foreign operations in the section entitled “ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.”
Industry Overview 
Contact centers must evolve in today’s rapidly changing technology environment 
Contact centers are vital hubs of interaction between organizations and their customers and are mission critical to the successful execution of customer service, sales and marketing strategies. Both consumer and enterprise technology trends are driving an evolution in contact center strategies. Today, customers increasingly expect seamless communications across multiple channels, including voice, chat, email, web, social media and mobile, thereby increasing the number of touch points between organizations and their customers. Along with these additional channels, customers expect personalized interactions to enhance overall customer service. Delivering customer interactions to an appropriate agent resource, while delivering relevant customer data to the agent in real-time, is crucial in providing effective customer service. 
As the needs of organizations and their customers have become more sophisticated, so have the demands for contact centers. Striving for greater efficiency in meeting demand, the use of remote agents and geographically dispersed contact centers has proliferated. To increase capacity and undertake upgrades, on-premise contact centers must unify geographically dispersed agents and hardware, which requires building out teams and facilities to forecasted future capacity and is a long-term undertaking. In order to meet these changing demands, contact centers must upgrade their existing on-premise contact center systems or migrate their contact center operations to the cloud. 
Legacy on-premise contact center systems are inefficient 
The majority of contact center operations today rely on legacy on-premise contact center systems that include business workflows, as well as hardware and software architectures designed more than a decade ago. Legacy on-premise contact center systems are typically developed for location-specific deployments and are often costly, inflexible, complex and require significant duplication of effort and integration across multiple sites. Key shortcomings of these legacy systems include: 

• | Long and complex implementation and upgrade cycles. Implementation of legacy on-premise contact center systems requires long deployment timelines and complex integrations with other enterprise systems. Once these systems have been deployed, integrated and customized, upgrades and modifications can be extremely challenging. Due to these customized solutions and complex integrations, clients will often forego or postpone upgrades for fear of disabling key functionality. If they do choose to upgrade, clients are often required to rebuild integrations in order to retain full functionality, which frequently results in significant expenditures of time, resources and capital. 


• | Inflexible resource deployment. As organizations expand globally, they require the ability to easily manage remote agents and quickly adjust agent seats to accommodate peak call volumes. Most legacy on-premise contact center systems do not provide these capabilities and, as a result, their clients are typically unable to quickly scale their contact center operations in response to changing business needs. This often results in costly over-building of additional capacity to accommodate peak volumes. 

5


• | Duplicative technology stacks across multiple sites. Organizations must integrate multiple contact center sites to drive efficiency and create a unified customer view. Organizations running on-premise systems often find themselves with dissimilar systems at each site resulting in non-integrated and inefficient silos of technology. Moreover, technology at each site is in a constant state of change over time. The initial and ongoing integration of these contact center sites for such organizations requires significant ongoing investment. 

Our Opportunity 
Based on our current product offerings and historical average annual recurring revenue per seat, we believe that the market for our solution is approximately $24 billion annually worldwide. Gartner estimated that there are approximately 15.8 million contact center agents worldwide. Furthermore, we believe cloud penetration of the contact center market in North America is between 10% to 15%. We believe the market for contact center solutions is undergoing a significant shift to the cloud driven primarily by: 

• | adoption of cloud CRM solutions;


• | sophistication of cloud contact center software solutions;


• | technology refresh of on-premise contact center systems; and


• | simplicity of the cloud vs. complexity of legacy on-premise.

Adoption of cloud CRM solutions has grown as organizations seek to enhance their sales strategies, increase business agility and reduce costs. CRM solutions typically integrate deeply with contact center solutions to provide agents with real-time access to customer information. The shift to cloud CRM and ease of integration are creating significant demand for integrated cloud contact center software solutions. As the market opportunity has expanded, cloud contact center software solutions have evolved to meet the requirements of large, complex enterprise contact centers. We believe organizations have typically refreshed their on-premise contact center systems every 8 to 10 years. Given the prevalence of cloud CRM and the capabilities of cloud-based contact centers, cloud solutions are increasingly considered as a replacement alternative to legacy on-premise contact center systems during these refresh decisions.

8

time a replacement decision is made. We believe there is a substantial opportunity for us to win new clients and increase our market share given the strength and client benefits of our cloud solution. We intend to continue to invest aggressively in our sales force and marketing capabilities to win new clients. 

• | Continue to increase sales in our existing client base. Many of our clients initially deploy our solution to support only a portion of their contact center agents. We intend to increase the number of agents using our solution within our existing clients as they experience the benefits of our cloud solution. We also intend to sell our existing clients incremental applications to increase our revenue and the value of our existing client relationships. 


• | Maintain our innovation leadership by strengthening and extending our solution. We have an innovative platform that has enabled us to establish a leadership position in the cloud contact center software market. To preserve and expand our leadership position, we intend to continue to make significant investments in research and development to strengthen our existing solution and develop additional industry-leading contact center features and applications. Facilitated by the Five9 “Genius” AI-enablement layer, we plan to provide our customers with innovative AI-powered applications and use-cases, including conversational virtual agents, agent assistance, business insights and AI-powered routing. We are designing our AI products to improve customer experiences and operational effectiveness while realizing potentially significant cost savings. 


• | Access to Data. As AI becomes increasingly important in the contact center market, access to data will become a key differentiator among vendors. Leading vendors processing a high number of customers interactions will have more data that can be applied to necessary training of machine learning algorithms, which creates a positive reinforcement cycle that we believe will enable customer contact solutions to be more effective. 


• | Further develop our partner ecosystem. We have established strong partner relationships with organizations in the contact center ecosystem to further enhance the value of our VCC cloud platform. We intend to continue to cultivate new relationships with additional CRM, WFO and unified communications partners as well as system integrators, master agents, resellers, PBX providers, phone systems vendors, independent software vendors and telephony providers to enhance the value of our solution and drive sales. 


• | Expand internationally. To date, our primary focus has been on the U.S. market, which represented 93%, 94% and 93% of our revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, based on bill to addresses. We believe there is a significant opportunity for our cloud solution to disrupt incumbent legacy on-premise contact center systems internationally. We plan to increase our sales capabilities internationally by expanding our direct sales force and working with channel partners to target these markets and grow our international client base. We have co-location data center facilities in Europe to provide clients in certain countries of the European Union, or EU, with regional access to our cloud contact center solution to better serve local needs. 


• | Selectively pursue acquisitions. In addition to organically developing and strengthening our solution, we intend to selectively explore acquisition opportunities of companies and technologies to expand the functionality of our solution, provide access to new clients or markets, or both.

Inbound Contact Center: With our VCC cloud platform, organizations of all sizes have everything they need to handle their inbound customer engagement. This includes the ability to take voice calls, respond to chat and email, and engage with a wide range of social media sources. Our platform includes a full-featured IVR system that allows our clients to provide a self-service capability and to automatically determine the customer intent and identify the type of resource to best handle the customer inquiry. At the center of our VCC cloud platform is the ACD module which provides intelligent routing of customer interactions. This enables clients to classify and prioritize customer interactions and ensure that the interactions are delivered to the most appropriate resource to provide the best customer experience and maximize business results.
Through CTI capabilities, out-of-the-box integrations with CRM solutions (such as Salesforce, Oracle, Zendesk, Microsoft and ServiceNow), and easy to use open APIs, clients can provide a personalized customer experience by prioritizing important customers and delivering customer information to the agent handling the interaction. This promotes quick first contact resolution, which is a key factor in delivering a superior customer experience. 
Outbound Contact Center: Our Outbound Contact Center application enables our clients to improve the efficiency and productivity of outbound contact center agents. We provide a complete solution for outbound sales and marketing campaigns, including multiple automated dialing options, so our clients can find the right match for their needs and environment, whether outbound business-to-consumer, or B2C, business-to-business, B2B, or 1:1 proactive customer care. We provide a variety of outbound dialer modes, including a patented predictive dialer capability. The predictive dialer greatly enhances the productivity of agents and sales representatives by increasing productive talk time and minimizing idle time spent listening to voice mail and busy signals. These dialer solutions allow our clients to choose the automation capabilities that best align with their contact center environment and objectives, including lead prospecting, qualifying, nurturing and converting. We also provide campaign management tools such as list management, sophisticated dialer rules and agent scripting. In addition, we provide a manual touch mode option that provides tools to outbound clients to comply with the TCPA regulations. 
Blended Contact Center:    We provide both inbound and outbound capabilities on a single platform to unify contact center operations and enable end-to-end customer engagement. This improves agent productivity as interactions are automatically selected and routed to agents based on interaction volume. When inbound call volumes are low, the blending ability allows clients to shift inbound agent resources to outbound-related functions. For example, inbound agents can be assigned to the outbound queue for automatic follow-ups on any customer interaction, flag customer surveys for personalized attention, or resolve open customer issues. 
Omnichannel Applications Powered by Five9: Our multichannel applications are powered by a unique set of technologies. These technologies include an advanced NLP engine to filter and categorize interactions, eliminate spam and determine sentiment. Based on a client’s unique set of business policies and needs, our solution provides simpler, smarter, and more productive omnichannel engagement by offering agents sentiment analysis, clustering, trending topics, and relevance. In addition, Five9 powers agent assistance tools to help agents resolve issues quickly.

Our solution provides real-time supervisor tools to monitor and manage the performance of agents and call flows. We also provide a suite of configurable management reports to enable clients to manage the end-to-end performance of their contact center operations. For clients with high-end Workforce Optimization, or WFO, needs, our solution can provide fully integrated workforce and quality management applications through our strategic relationships with Calabrio, Verint and CSI. Our solution has native recording capabilities for contact centers that need to record their interactions. 
Our clients can access our VCC cloud platform in five different ways: 

• | Agent Desktop: Serves as the unified environment for contact center agents. Agents are provided with one easy-to-use desktop that is designed to allow agents to seamlessly conduct omnichannel interactions. Our universal transaction model adjusts to the needs of the interaction, including voice, chat, email, web, social media or mobile, yet feels familiar to the agent, making training simple. Automated call scripting and real-time customer data, such as purchase and interaction history, is delivered to empower agents with the information they need to deliver a superior customer experience. 


• | CRM Integrations: For clients that prefer to have their agents or sales representatives work within their CRM desktop, we offer pre-built integrations with leading providers of CRM systems such as Salesforce, Oracle, Zendesk, Microsoft and ServiceNow. In addition, professional services can provide integrations with custom or legacy CRM systems. Our solution provides softphone and telephony capabilities within the CRM desktop, and routes each customer interaction to an appropriate agent resource. Agents are able to work within a familiar desktop, equipped with full telephony controls and giving them immediate access to the most current, relevant and accurate information about the customer. 


• | Supervisor Plus: Provides supervisors with a modern browser-based tool to optimize the contact center and ensure high quality customer interactions. This tool includes a visual supervisor dashboard that provides easy to use visibility into call routing, queues, service levels, workflow management, utilization, campaign statistics and agent productivity. A mobile tablet version of the supervisor application is also available to help supervisors monitor agents, listen in on conversations, coach agents, and oversee queues and agent performance metrics while on the contact center floor. These metrics typically include average handle time, first contact resolution, number of interactions handled and contact outcomes. 


• | Administrator: Provides administrators with a comprehensive set of integrated tools to easily configure agent skills (such as language, domain expertise, and media channels to service), determine interaction routing strategies, specify IVR scripts and manage the contact center operation. The Five9 Administrator system is easy to use so contact center business personnel can set up and make changes themselves, without having to rely on specialized IT staff often required to manage legacy on-premise contact center systems. This represents a key advantage of our VCC cloud platform as it allows businesses to adapt quickly to keep up with the rapid changes required in contact center operations. 


• | Reporting and Analytics: Real-time and historical reports provide statistics and key performance indicators to allow executives and supervisors to monitor the contact center, improve reaction time to interaction volume and manage agents more effectively. We provide more than 100 standard reports with multiple views 

11

and drill-downs into individual inbound calls and multichannel interaction metrics, customer interaction outcomes, and outbound sales and marketing program metrics. Our reporting module also enables clients to build customized reports and reporting schedules.
Experience Orchestration:  The Five9 Engagement Workflow allows businesses to decide how customers can interact with the contact center. At the heart of Engagement Workflow is a powerful drag-and-drop workflow tool that is used to configure the customer experience. This is done using a set of pre-built and configurable modules; speech services such as automated speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis; text services such as NLP; data services such as database query; customization services such as scripting; and real-time rules modules. The Five9 Genius AI-enablement layer is an integral part of Engagement Workflow, which allows AI technologies to be effectively applied to the delivery of experience to the customer.
Five9 Open Platform: We provide a comprehensive set of open APIs and SDKs that allow customers, developer partners, system integrators and independent software vendors to customize our application and to integrate complementary products with the Five9 solution. This open platform approach ensures that customers can have the confidence that the already high level of functionality we provide out-of-the-box can be further customized or enhanced to meet the specific needs of their business.

We offer free trials and services to allow prospective clients to experience the quality and ease-of-use of our cloud solution, to learn about the features and functionality of our VCC cloud platform in more detail, and to quantify the benefits of our cloud solution. 
To complement our sales and marketing efforts, we have developed a large ecosystem of software, technology, telephony and system integrator partners and independent software vendors who help increase awareness of our solution and generate new and installed base sales opportunities. 
Research and Development 
Our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to research and development and our ability to improve the functionality of, and add new features to, our VCC cloud platform. Our core research and development center is based in our San Ramon, California headquarters with additional engineers located in Russia, which allows us to benefit from relatively low-cost and highly skilled software developers. Our engineering team has deep software and telecommunications skills, and works closely with our sales team to identify our clients’ product requirements. In addition, continuous interactions with our partners enable our engineers to enhance the usability and performance of our platform and its integration with best-in-class CRM and other business applications and telephony technologies.

As of December 31, 2018, we had 204 employees in our research and development group. Our research and development expenses totaled $34.2 million, $27.1 million and $23.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We intend to increase our rate of research and development spending in 2019 to continue to deliver robust functionality to our clients. 
Professional Services 
We offer comprehensive professional services to our clients to assist in the successful implementation and optimization of our solution. Our professional services include application configuration, system integration, and education and training. Our clients may use our professional services team for implementing our solution or, in limited cases, they may also choose to perform these services themselves or engage third-party service providers to perform such services. Our cloud solution allows us to eliminate the need for lengthy and complex technology integrations, such as deploying equipment or maintaining hardware infrastructure for individual clients. As a result, we are typically able to deploy and optimize our solution in significantly less time than required for deployments of legacy on-premise contact center systems. 
Technology and Operations
Our highly scalable and flexible VCC cloud platform is the result of more than 16 years of research, development, client engagement and operational experience. The platform is comprised of in-house developed intellectual property, open source products and commercially available hardware and software. The platform is designed to be redundant and we believe that all components can be upgraded, expanded or replaced with minimal or no interruption in service. 
We currently deliver our services globally from four third-party co-location data center facilities located in Santa Clara, California; Atlanta, Georgia; Slough, England and Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We also deliver some services using public cloud infrastructure and plan to increase our use of public cloud infrastructure over time. Our infrastructure, including our third-party co-location facilities, is designed to support real-time mission-critical telecommunications, applications and operational support systems. Our infrastructure is built with redundant, fault-tolerant components divided into distinct security zones forming protective layers for our applications and customer data. 
We have designed and maintain an operations, capacity and security program to monitor and maintain our platform, ensure efficient utilization of the platform capacity and protect against security threats or data breaches. Our operations team monitors our data centers for potential performance issues, unauthorized attempts to access secure data or applications and the overall integrity of the platform. 
Competition 
The market for contact center software is fragmented, highly competitive and evolving rapidly in response to shifting consumer behavior, especially the rapid adoption of mobile devices and social media. The proliferation of each is driving change in contact center technology, as customers expect companies to give them the option of seamless communication across any channel according to their preference and needs. Combined with the disruptive nature of the cloud in the contact center, this has resulted in competitors who come from different market and product heritages, and who vary in size, breadth and scope of the products and services offered. We currently compete with large legacy on-premise contact center system vendors that offer on-premise enterprise telephony and contact center systems, such as Avaya Inc., or Avaya, and Cisco Systems, Inc., or Cisco, and legacy on-premise software companies that come from a CTI heritage, such as Aspect Software, Inc., or Aspect, and Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc., or Genesys (including through its acquisition of Interactive Intelligence Group, Inc., or Interactive Intelligence). These legacy technology and software companies are increasingly expanding their traditional on-premise contact center systems with competing cloud offerings, either through acquisitions or in-house development. Additionally, we compete with vendors that historically provided other contact center services and technologies and expanded to offer cloud contact center software. These companies include inContact, Inc. (acquired by NICE Ltd.), and Seranova, which previously was named LiveOps, Inc., or LiveOps. We also face competition from smaller contact center service providers with specialized contact center software offerings and from larger companies that have recently introduced products that compete with ours. For example, Amazon.com, Inc., or Amazon, and Twilio Inc., or Twilio, have introduced solutions aimed at companies who wish to build their own contact centers with in-house developers. Our actual and potential competitors may enjoy competitive advantages over us, including greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger

marketing budgets and greater financial and technical resources. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include: 

• | breadth and depth of solution features;


• | reliability, scalability and quality of the platform;


• | ease and speed of deployment;


• | ease of application administration and use;


• | level of client satisfaction;


• | domain expertise in contact center operations;


• | integration with third-party applications;


• | ability to quickly adapt and upgrade to new and evolving technologies;


• | pricing;


• | ability to quickly adjust agent seats based on business requirements;


• | breadth and domain expertise of the sales, marketing and support organization;


• | ability to keep pace with client requirements;


• | extent and efficiency of our professional services;


• | ability to offer multiple channels of engagement; and


• | size and financial stability of operations.

We believe we currently compete effectively with respect to each of the factors identified above.
Intellectual Property 
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, confidentiality agreements, and other contractual protections, to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. In addition, we require our employees and independent contractors involved in development of intellectual property on our behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law. 
As of December 31, 2018, our intellectual property portfolio included five registered U.S. trademarks, 10 issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application and one registered U.S. copyright. As of December 31, 2018, we also had three issued patents and 10 trademark registrations outside the U.S. The expiration dates of our issued patents range from 2030 to 2034. In general, our patents and patent applications apply to aspects of our VCC cloud platform. 
We are also a party to various license agreements with third parties that typically grant us the right to use certain third-party technology in conjunction with our solution. We expect that software and other applications in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
Seasonality
We believe that there can be seasonal factors that may cause our revenues in the first half of a year to be relatively lower than our revenues in the second half of a year. During each of 2018, 2017 and 2016, 53% of our total revenues were generated in the second half of each year. We believe this is due to increased activities in retail, healthcare and education.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 983 full-time employees, including 432 in technology and operations, 204 in research and development, 228 in sales and marketing, and 119 in general and administrative. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations are good and we have never experienced any work stoppages.

Regulatory
The following summarizes important, but not all, federal, state and foreign regulations that could impact our operations. Federal and state regulations are subject to judicial review, administrative revision and statutory changes through legislation that could materially affect how we and others in this industry operate.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 vests the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, with jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services, while preserving state and local jurisdiction over many aspects of these services. As a result, telecommunications services are regulated at both the federal and state levels in the United States.
We are classified as a telecommunications service provider for federal regulatory purposes. Since our business is regulated by the FCC, we are subject to existing or potential FCC regulations relating to privacy, disability access, porting of numbers, automatic number dialing, contributions to the federal Universal Service Fund and related funds, or USF, and other requirements. If we do not comply with FCC rules and regulations, we could be subject to FCC enforcement actions, fines, loss of operating authority and possibly restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our services. Any enforcement action by the FCC, which may be a public process, would hurt our reputation in the industry, possibly impair our ability to sell our services to clients and could harm our business and results of operations. The FTC also has jurisdiction over some of our business practices, including advertising, trade practices, privacy and telemarketing. If we do not comply with FTC rules and regulations, we could be subject to an FTC enforcement action, fines or restrictions on our business practices.
We must comply with numerous federal regulations, including:

• | Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, which regulates the use of automatic dialing equipment and pre-recorded messages to contact consumers, and the Telemarketing Sales Rule, which has similar obligations as to telemarketing activities;


• | CALEA, which requires covered entities to assist law enforcement in undertaking electronic surveillance;


• | contributions to the USF, which requires that we pay a percentage of our revenues resulting from the provision of interstate telecommunications services to support certain federal programs;


• | payment of annual FCC regulatory fees based on our interstate and international revenues;


• | rules pertaining to access to our services by people with disabilities and contributions to the Telecommunications Relay Services fund;


• | FCC rules regarding CPNI which require that we not use such information without customer approval, subject to certain exceptions; and


• | Federal Trade Commission Act and rules promulgated thereunder, which generally relate to avoiding unfair and deceptive trade practices, our advertising, and privacy practices.

In addition, we must make contributions and other payments on our usage-based fees to state and local governmental entities. The tax and fee structure for communications services such as ours is complex, ambiguous and subject to interpretation. If taxing and regulatory authorities enact new rules or regulations or expand their interpretations of existing rules and regulations, we could incur additional liabilities. In addition, the collection of additional taxes, fees or surcharges in the future could increase our prices or reduce our profit margins. Compliance with these regulations may also make us less competitive with those competitors who are not subject to, or choose not to comply with, these regulations. See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements under ITEM 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of our liabilities related to USF matters.
As we expand internationally, we will be subject to laws and regulations in the countries in which we offer our services. Regulation of the solutions we provide outside the U.S. varies from country to country, is often unclear, and may be more onerous than those imposed on our services in the U.S. For example, the European Union adopted a new law governing data protection and privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The law requires companies to meet new and extended requirements regarding the processing of personal data. Non-compliance with the GDPR can trigger steep fines of up to €20 million or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher. In addition, we are subject to Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, or PIPEDA, and the analogous provincial laws, which similarly impose data privacy and security obligations on our processing of personal data. Our regulatory obligations in foreign jurisdictions could harm the use or cost of our solution in international locations as data protection and privacy laws and regulations around the world continue to evolve.
15

The legislative and regulatory scheme for telecommunications service providers and other solutions we provide will continue to evolve and can be expected to change the competitive environment for these services. It is not possible to predict how such evolution and changes will affect our business or our industry. If we do not comply with current or future rules or regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to substantial additional fines and penalties, we may have to restructure our service offerings, exit certain markets, accept lower margins or raise the price of our services, any of which could harm our business and results of operations. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Regulatory Matters” under ITEM 1A of this Form 10-K for more information.
