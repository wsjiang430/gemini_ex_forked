ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Unless otherwise indicated by the context, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or “Prestige” refer to Prestige Consumer Healthcare Inc. and our subsidiaries. Prior to August 17, 2018, the Company's name was Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc.  Reference to a year (e.g., “2019”) refers to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year.
We are engaged in the development, manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of well-recognized, brand name, over-the-counter (“OTC”) healthcare and, prior to the sale of our Household Cleaning segment on July 2, 2018, household cleaning products to mass merchandisers and drug, food, dollar, convenience and club stores, and ecommerce channels in North America (the United States and Canada) and in Australia and certain other international markets.  We use the strength of our brands, our established retail distribution network, a low-cost operating model and our experienced management team to our competitive advantage.  Our ultimate success is dependent on several factors, including our ability to:

• | Develop and execute effective sales, advertising and marketing programs;


• | Integrate acquired brands;


• | Establish and maintain third party manufacturing and distribution to fulfill customer demands;


• | Develop innovative new products;


• | Respond to the technological advances and product introductions of our competitors; and


• | Continue to grow our presence in the United States and international markets.

We currently conduct our operations in two reportable segments: North American OTC Healthcare and International OTC Healthcare. We sold our Household Cleaning segment on July 2, 2018. Our business, business model, competitive strengths and growth strategy face various risks that are described in "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Major Brands
Our major brands, set forth in the table below, have strong levels of consumer awareness and retail distribution across all major channels.  These brands accounted for approximately 78.6%, 79.1%, and 74.5% of our total revenues for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

(1) | We have prepared the information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with regard to the market position for our brands based in part on data generated by Information Resources, Inc. (“IRI”), an independent market research firm, for the 52-week period ended March 24, 2019. IRI reports total U.S. Multi-Outlet retail sales data in the food, drug and mass merchandise markets. 


(2) | “Market segment” is defined by us and is either a standard IRI category or a segment within a standard IRI category and is based on our product offerings and the categories in which we compete.


(3) | Gaviscon is distributed by us in Canada only, and the market information was generated by Nielsen, an independent third party market research firm for the 52-week period ending March 3, 2019. Figures represent national, all channel retail sales data in the food, drug, mass merchandise (including Walmart), general merchandise (including Dollarama), and warehouse club stores (including Costco). Data reported for warehouse club and general merchandise is calculated based on home scan panel data, and not direct point of sale data. 


(4) | The brands from our Care Pharmaceuticals Pty. Ltd. subsidiary ("Care Pharma") includes the Fess line of cold/allergy and saline nasal health products, which is the leading saline spray for both adults and children in Australia, and Hydralyte, which is the leading OTC brand in oral rehydration in Australia. Market information was generated by IRI Aztec, an independent market research firm, for the 52-week period ending March 17, 2019. 

Our products are sold through multiple channels, including mass merchandisers and drug, food, dollar, convenience and club stores and ecommerce channels, which reduces our exposure to any single distribution channel.  
We have grown our product portfolio both organically and through acquisitions. We develop our existing brands by investing in new product lines, brand extensions and strong advertising support. Acquisitions of OTC brands have also been an important part of our growth strategy. We have acquired strong and well-recognized brands from consumer products, pharmaceutical and private equity companies. While certain of these brands have long histories of brand development and investment, we believe that, at the 
 3

time we acquired them, most were considered “non-core” by their previous owners. As a result, these acquired brands did not benefit from adequate management focus and marketing support during the period prior to their acquisition, which created opportunities for us to reinvigorate these brands and improve their performance post-acquisition. After adding a core brand to our portfolio, we seek to increase its sales, market share and distribution in both existing and new channels through our established retail distribution network.  We pursue this growth through increased spending on advertising and promotional support, new sales and marketing strategies, improved packaging and formulations and innovative development of brand extensions. 
Competitive Strengths
Diversified Portfolio of Well-Recognized and Established Consumer Brands
We own and market a diverse portfolio of well-recognized consumer brands, some of which were established over 100 years ago.  Our diverse portfolio of products provides us with multiple sources of growth and minimizes our reliance on any one product or category. We provide significant marketing support to our portfolio that is designed to enhance our sales growth and our long-term profitability across our major and other significant brands, sometimes referred to as core brands (which are discussed on page 7 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K).  
Strong Competitor in Attractive Categories
We compete in product categories that address recurring consumer needs.  We believe we are well positioned in these categories due to the long history and consumer awareness of our brands, our strong market positions, and our low-cost operating model. The markets in which we sell our products, however, are highly competitive and include numerous national and global manufacturers, distributors, marketers and retailers. As a result, any one or more of our brands could suffer a decline in market position or sales.    
Proven Ability to Develop and Introduce New Products
We focus our marketing and product development efforts on the identification of under-served consumer needs, the design of products that directly address those needs, and the ability to extend our highly recognizable brand names to other products.  As an example of this philosophy, in 2019 we launched a number of new products, including, but not limited to, Summer's Eve Fresh Cycle, Clear Eyes Advanced Dry & Itchy, DenTek Ultimate Guard, and Compound W Nitrofreeze.  In 2018, we launched DenTek Comfort Picks, Summer's Eve Simply Coconut Water Wash and Dramamine-N Long Lasting Nausea Relief. Although line extensions and new product introductions are important to the overall growth of a brand, our efforts may reduce sales of existing products within that brand.  
Efficient Operating Model
To gain operating efficiencies, we oversee the production planning and quality control aspects of the manufacturing, warehousing and distribution of our products, while we primarily outsource the operating elements of these functions to well-established third party providers.  This approach allows us to benefit from their core competencies and maintain a highly variable cost structure with low overhead, limited working capital requirements, and minimal investment in capital expenditures, as evidenced by the following:

 | GrossMargin % | G&A %To Total Revenues | CapEx %To Total Revenues
2019 | 56.9 | 9.2 | 1.1 
2018 | 55.4 | 8.2 | 1.2 
2017 | 56.7 | 10.1 | 0.3 

In 2019, our gross margin percentage increased 150 basis points versus 2018, primarily as a result of the divestiture of our Household Cleaning segment which had lower gross margins. In 2018, our gross margin percentage decreased 130 basis points versus 2017, primarily as a result of higher distribution costs and the acquisition of C.B. Fleet Company, Inc. ("Fleet"), which has lower gross margins. General and administrative costs, as a percentage of total revenues, increased 100 basis points in 2019 versus 2018, primarily as a result of maintaining costs in the current period despite selling our Household Cleaning segment. General and administrative costs, as a percentage of total revenues, decreased 190 basis points in 2018 versus 2017, primarily as a result of higher acquisition and integration charges in 2017 related to our acquisition of Fleet. In 2019, our capital expenditures as a percentage of total revenues were relatively flat versus 2018, and increased 90 basis points in 2018 versus 2017 primarily due to capital expenditures related to our manufacturing facility in Lynchburg, Virginia, which was acquired in conjunction with our acquisition of Fleet.

Management Team with Proven Ability to Acquire, Integrate and Grow Brands
Our business has grown through acquisition and expansion of the many brands we have purchased as a result of the efforts of our experienced management team.  Our management team has significant experience in consumer product marketing, sales, legal and regulatory compliance, product development and customer service.  We rely on experienced personnel to bear the substantial responsibility of brand management and to effectuate our growth strategy and these managers nurture the brands to allow the brands to grow and evolve.
Growth Strategy
In order to continue to enhance our brands and drive growth, we focus our growth strategy on the following core competencies:

• | Effective Marketing and Advertising;


• | Sales Excellence;


• | Extraordinary Customer Service;


• | Innovation and Product Development; and


• | Strategic Acquisitions/Capital Uses.

We execute this strategy through the following efforts:

• | Investments in Advertising and Promotion

We invest in advertising and promotion to drive the growth of our major brands and other significant brands, sometimes referred to as core brands, which are discussed on page 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Our marketing strategy is focused primarily on consumer oriented initiatives that target consumers via mass media, digital marketing, in-store programming and coupons. While the absolute level of marketing expenditures differs by brand and category, we have often increased the amount of investment in our brands after acquiring them.  Advertising and promotional spend on our top five selling brands was approximately 17.4% of the total revenues associated with these brands in 2019. 

• | Growing our Categories and Market Share with Innovative New Products

One of our strategies is to broaden the categories in which we participate and increase our share within those categories through ongoing product innovation.  In 2019, we launched a number of new products, including, but not limited to, Summer's Eve Fresh Cycle, Clear Eyes Advanced Dry & Itchy and DenTek Ultimate Guard. While there is always a risk that sales of existing products may be reduced by new product introductions, our goal is to grow the overall sales of our brands.

• | Increasing Distribution Across Multiple Channels

Our broad distribution base attempts to ensure that our products are well positioned across all available channels and that we are able to participate in changing consumer retail trends.  In an effort to ensure continued sales growth, we focus on expanding our reliance on direct sales while reducing our reliance on brokers.  

• | Growing Our International Business

International sales beyond the borders of North America represented 9.6%, 8.8% and 8.4% of total revenues in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We have designed and developed both products and packaging for specific international markets and expect that our international revenues will continue to grow. 
A number of our other brands have previously been sold internationally, and we seek to expand the number of brands sold through our existing international distribution network and continue to identify additional distribution partners for further expansion into other international markets. 
 5


• | Pursuing Strategic Acquisitions

Acquisitions are an important part of our overall strategy for growing revenue.  We have a history of growth through acquisition, the most recent example being the acquisition of Fleet in January 2017 (see "Our History and Accomplishments" below). While we believe that there will continue to be a pipeline of acquisition candidates for us to investigate, strategic fit, availability of capital and relative cost are of the utmost importance in our decision to pursue such opportunities.  We believe our business model allows us to integrate acquisitions in an efficient manner, while also providing opportunities to realize significant cost savings. 
Market Position
During 2019, approximately 73.6% of our total revenues were from major brands with a number one or number two market position, compared with approximately 74.1% and 70.8% during 2018 and 2017, respectively.  In 2019, these brands included BC/Goody's,  Chloraseptic, Clear Eyes, Compound W, Debrox, DenTek, Dramamine, Fess, Fleet, Gaviscon, Hydralyte, Monistat, Nix, Pedia-Lax, and Summer's Eve.
Our History and Accomplishments
Since our formation as a Delaware corporation in 1996, we have added brands to our portfolio principally by acquiring strong and well-recognized brands from larger consumer products and pharmaceutical companies.  We engaged in strategic mergers and acquisitions as well as divestitures over the last three years as follows:
Acquisitions and Divestitures
On July 2, 2018, we sold the Comet®, Spic and Span®, Chore Boy®, Chlorinol® and Cinch® brands, as well as associated inventory. These brands represented our Household Cleaning segment. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $1.3 million. 
On January 26, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Fleet pursuant to a merger agreement, dated as of December 22, 2016, for $823.7 million. The purchase price was funded by available cash on hand, additional borrowings under our asset-based revolving credit facility (the "2012 ABL Revolver"), and a new $740.0 million senior secured incremental term loan under our existing term loan facility (the "2012 Term Loan"). As a result of the merger, we acquired women's health, gastrointestinal and dermatological care OTC brands, including Summer’s Eve, Fleet, and Boudreaux's Butt Paste, as well as a “mix and fill” manufacturing facility in Lynchburg, Virginia. The financial results from the Fleet acquisition are included in the Company's North American and International OTC Healthcare segments.
On July 7, 2016, we completed the sale of the Pediacare®, New Skin® and Fiber Choice® brands for $40.0 million plus the cost of inventory. During the year ended March 31, 2017, we recorded a pre-tax loss on sale of $56.2 million. Concurrent with the completion of the sale of these brands, we entered into an option agreement with the buyer to purchase Dermoplast® at a specified earnings multiple as defined in the option agreement. The buyer paid a $1.25 million deposit for this option in September 2016 and later notified us of its election to exercise the option. In December 2016, we completed the sale of the Dermoplast® brand, and in a separate transaction, the e.p.t® brand, for an aggregate amount of $59.6 million. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax net gain on these divestitures of $3.9 million.
Historically, we received royalty income from the licensing of the names of certain of our brands in geographic areas or markets in which we do not directly compete. We had royalty agreements for the Comet® brand for several years, which included options on behalf of the licensee to purchase license rights in certain geographic areas and markets in perpetuity. In December 2014, we amended those agreements, and we sold rights to use of the Comet® brand in certain Eastern European countries to a third party licensee in exchange for $10.0 million as a partial early buyout of the license. The amended agreement provided that we would continue to receive royalty payments of $1.0 million per quarter for the remaining geographic areas and also granted the licensee an option to acquire the license rights in the remaining geographic areas any time after June 30, 2016. In July 2016, the licensee elected to exercise its option. In August 2016, we received $11.0 million for the purchase of the remaining license rights and, as a result, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $1.2 million and reduced our indefinite-lived tradenames by $9.0 million. Furthermore, the licensee was no longer required to make additional royalty payments to us, and as a result, our royalty income was reduced accordingly. We sold the Comet® brand on July 2, 2018.

Products
After the sale of our Household Cleaning segment on July 2, 2018, we conduct our operations through two reportable segments:

• | North American OTC Healthcare; and


• | International OTC Healthcare.

Our portfolio of OTC Healthcare products includes the following major brands: DenTek specialty oral care products, Monistat women’s health products, Nix lice treatment products, Chloraseptic sore throat treatments, Clear Eyes eye care products, Compound W wart treatments, Luden's throat drops, Dramamine motion sickness treatments, BC and Goody's pain relievers, Debrox earwax remover, Pedia-Lax pediatric laxatives, Fleet laxatives, Summer's Eve women's health products, Boudreaux's Butt Paste diaper rash treatment and prevention products, Hydralyte for rehydration and electrolyte replacement, Fess nasal saline spray and Gaviscon antacid in Canada.
In 2019, the North American OTC Healthcare segments accounted for 88.4% of our net revenues, compared to 83.5% and 81.7% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. In 2019, the International OTC Healthcare segment accounted for 9.6% of our net revenues, compared to 8.8% and 8.3% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
The following describes our major brands in the North American and International OTC Healthcare segments:
BC/Goody's
BC and Goody's powders compete in the $3.7 billion U.S. Adult Analgesic category. They are the top two U.S. OTC pain relief powder brands. Independently developed in North Carolina over 80 years ago, their unique form delivers fast pain relief. The combined brands are the number one Adult Internal Analgesic in U.S. convenience stores.

Chloraseptic
Chloraseptic sprays were originally developed by a dentist in 1957 to relieve sore throats and mouth pain. Since then, Chloraseptic has expanded into the lozenge form, and is the only brand to offer sore throat relief in both product forms. Chloraseptic holds the position as the #1 Sore Throat Brand in the marketplace and was recently ranked as the #1 Doctor Recommended Sore Throat Remedy.

Compound W
Compound W has a long heritage, with its wart removal products having been introduced more than 50 years ago.  Compound W products are specially designed to provide relief from common and plantar warts and are sold in multiple forms of treatment depending on the consumer’s need, including Fast-Acting Liquid, Fast-Acting Gel, One Step Pads, Freeze Off and new Nitrofreeze™, the first over-the-counter nitrous oxide wart treatment, which penetrates deep to provide the highest cure rate in one treatment. Compound W is the number one U.S. pharmacist recommended wart remover according to Pharmacy Times. Additionally, Compound W is the number one wart removal brand in the United States.  
Debrox
Debrox is the number one brand of U.S. OTC earwax removal aids.

Marketing and Sales
Our marketing strategy is based on the acquisition and the rejuvenation of established consumer brands that possess what we believe to be significant brand value and unrealized potential.  Our marketing objective is to increase sales and market share by developing innovative new products and line extensions and executing creative and cost-effective advertising and promotional programs.  After we acquire a brand, we implement a brand building strategy that uses the brand’s existing consumer awareness to maximize sales of current products and provides a vehicle to drive growth through product innovation.  This brand building process involves the evaluation of the existing brand name, the development and introduction of innovative new products, and the execution of support programs.  Recognizing that financial resources are limited, we allocate our resources to focus on our core brands with the most impactful, consumer-relevant initiatives that we believe have the greatest opportunities for growth and financial success.  Brand priorities vary from year-to-year.
Customers 
Our senior management team and dedicated sales force strive to maintain long-standing relationships with our top 25 domestic customers.  We also contract with third party sales management enterprises that interface directly with our remaining customers and report directly to members of our sales management team.
We enjoy broad distribution across each of the major retail channels, including mass merchandisers, drug, food, dollar, convenience and club stores, and ecommerce channels.  The following table sets forth the percentage of gross sales for our domestic customers across our six major distribution channels during each of the past three years ended March 31:

 | Percentage of Gross Sales(1)
Channel of Distribution | 2019 | 2018 | 2017
Mass | 37.4 | 37.2 | 30.9
Drug | 26.4 | 24.6 | 22.8
Food | 15.5 | 15.8 | 16.5
Dollar | 6.8 | 9.0 | 9.8 
Convenience | 4.0 | 3.2 | 7.0 
Club | 1.6 | 1.6 | 3.0 
Other | 8.3 | 8.6 | 10.0


(1) | Includes estimates for some of our wholesale customers that service more than one distribution channel.

Due to the diversity of our product lines, we believe that each of these channels is important to our business, and we continue to seek opportunities for growth in each channel.
During 2019, 2018, and 2017, Walmart accounted for approximately 23.7%, 23.8%, and 21.1%, respectively, of our gross revenues. We expect that for future periods, our top ten customers, including Walmart, will, in the aggregate, continue to account for a large portion of our sales.
Our strong customer relationships and product recognition allow us to attempt to capitalize on a number of important strategic opportunities, including (i) minimization of slotting fees, (ii) maximization of new product introductions, (iii) maximization of shelf space prominence, and (iv) minimization of cash collection days.  We believe that our emphasis on strong customer relationships, speed and flexibility and leading sales technology capabilities, combined with consistent marketing support programs and ongoing product innovation, will continue to maximize our competitiveness in the increasingly complex retail environment.

The following table sets forth a list of our primary distribution channels and our principal customers for each channel: 

Distribution Channel | Customers | Distribution Channel | Customers 
Mass | Meijer | Drug | CVS 
 | Target | | Rite Aid 
 | Walmart | | Walgreens 
Food | Ahold/Delhaize | Dollar | Dollar General 
 | Kroger | | Dollar Tree

Outsourcing and Manufacturing
In order to maximize our competitiveness and efficiently allocate our resources, third party manufacturers fulfill most of our manufacturing needs.  We have found that contract manufacturing often maximizes our flexibility and responsiveness to industry and consumer trends while minimizing the need for capital expenditures.  We select contract manufacturers based on their core competencies and our perception of the best overall value, including factors such as (i) depth of services, (ii) professionalism and integrity of the management team, (iii) manufacturing agility and capacity, (iv) regulatory compliance, and (v) competitive pricing.  We also conduct thorough reviews of each potential manufacturer’s facilities, quality standards, capacity and financial stability.  We generally purchase only finished products from our manufacturers.
Our primary contract manufacturers provide comprehensive services from product development through the manufacturing of finished goods.  They are responsible for such matters as (i) production planning, (ii) product research and development, (iii) procurement, (iv) production, (v) quality testing, and (vi) almost all capital expenditures.  In most instances, we provide our contract manufacturers with guidance in the areas of (i) product development, (ii) performance criteria, (iii) regulatory guidance, (iv) sourcing of packaging materials, and (v) monthly master production schedules.  This management approach results in minimal capital expenditures and maximizes our cash flow, which allows us to reinvest to support our marketing initiatives, fund brand acquisitions or repay outstanding indebtedness.
At March 31, 2019, we had relationships with 113 third party manufacturers.  Of those, we had long-term contracts with 33 manufacturers that produced items that accounted for approximately 65.6% of our gross sales for 2019, compared to 46 manufacturers with long-term contracts that accounted for approximately 73.6% of our gross sales in 2018.  The fact that we do not have long-term contracts with certain manufacturers means that they could cease manufacturing our products at any time and for any reason or initiate arbitrary and costly price increases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Although we are in the process of negotiating long-term contracts with certain key manufacturers, we may not be able to reach a timely agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
At March 31, 2019, suppliers for our key brands included Contract Pharmacal Corporation, Bestco, Inc., Aspen Pharmacare, Fareva Richmond, Inc., Denison Pharmaceuticals, and Tower Laboratories Ltd. We enter into manufacturing agreements for a majority of our products by sales volume, each of which vary based on the capabilities of the third party manufacturer and the products being supplied.  These agreements explicitly outline the manufacturer’s obligations and product specifications with respect to the brand or brands being produced.  The purchase price of products is subject to change pursuant to the terms of these agreements due to fluctuations in raw material, packaging and labor costs.  Other products are manufactured on a purchase order basis, which is generally based on batch sizes and results in no long-term obligations or commitments.
In conjunction with the 2017 acquisition of Fleet, we acquired a "mix and fill" manufacturing facility in Lynchburg, Virginia, which manufactures products comprising approximately two-thirds of Fleet's sales. 
 10

We believe that most of the raw materials and packaging used to produce our products at our manufacturing facility in Virginia are readily available through multiple sources. 
Warehousing and Distribution
We receive orders from retailers and/or brokers primarily by electronic data interchange, which automatically enters each order into our information systems and then routes the order to our distribution center.  The distribution center will, in turn, send a confirmation that the order was received, fill the order and ship the order to the customer, while sending a shipment confirmation to us.  Upon receipt of the shipment confirmation, we send an invoice to the customer.
We currently manage product distribution in the continental United States primarily through one facility, which is owned and operated by a third party provider. On May 13, 2019, we entered into an agreement with a second third party logistics provider, and we intend to transition to a facility managed by a new warehouse provider. Our current U.S. warehouse provider provides, and our new warehouse provider will provide, warehouse services including storage, handling and shipping, as well as transportation services, with respect to our full line of products, including (i) complete management services, (ii) carrier claims administration, (iii) proof of delivery, (iv) procurement, (v) report generation, and (vi) freight payment services.
Competition
The business of selling brand name consumer products in the OTC Healthcare category is highly competitive.  This market includes numerous national and global manufacturers, distributors, marketers and retailers that actively compete for consumers’ business both in the United States and abroad.  In addition, like most companies that market products in this category, we are experiencing increased competition from “private label” products introduced by major retail chains.  While we believe that our branded products provide superior quality and benefits, we are unable to predict the extent to which consumers will purchase “private label” products as an alternative to branded products. 
Our principal competitors include Johnson & Johnson, The Procter & Gamble Company, Reckitt Benckiser, Mondelez International, GlaxoSmithKline - Memphis, Sunstar America, Inc., Pfizer, Novartis Consumer Healthcare, Combe, Bayer and Boehringer Ingelheim. 
We compete on the basis of numerous factors, including brand recognition, product quality, performance, value to customers, price, and product availability at the retail level.  Advertising, promotion, merchandising and packaging, the timing of new product introductions, and line extensions also have a significant impact on customers’ buying decisions and, as a result, on our sales.  The structure and quality of our sales force, as well as sell-through of our products, affect in-store position, wall display space and inventory levels in retail outlets.  Our markets are also highly sensitive to the introduction of new products, which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market.  
Many of the competitors noted above are larger and have substantially greater research and development and financial resources than we do, and may therefore have the ability to spend more aggressively and consistently on research and development, advertising and marketing, and to respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. See “Competitive Strengths” above for additional information regarding our competitive strengths and Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” below for additional information regarding competition in our industry.
Regulation
Product Regulation
The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, sale and storage of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various U.S. federal agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”), and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which our products are manufactured, distributed and sold.  Our Regulatory Team is guided by a senior member of management and staffed by individuals with appropriate legal and regulatory experience.  Our Regulatory and Operations teams work closely with our third party manufacturers and our own manufacturing operation on quality-related matters, while we monitor our third party manufacturers' compliance with FDA and foreign regulations and perform periodic audits to ensure compliance.  This continual evaluation process is designed to ensure that our manufacturing processes and products are of the highest quality and in compliance with known regulatory requirements.  If the FDA or a foreign governmental authority chooses to audit a particular third party manufacturing facility, we require the third party manufacturer to notify us immediately and update us on the progress of the audit as it proceeds.  If we or our manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could become subject to significant claims or penalties or be required to discontinue 
 11

the sale of the non-compliant product. In addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant additional compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales.
Most of our U.S. OTC drug products are regulated pursuant to the FDA’s monograph system.  The monographs set out the active ingredients and labeling indications that are permitted for certain broad categories of U.S. OTC drug products.  When the FDA has finalized a particular monograph, it has concluded that a properly labeled product formulation is generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded.  A tentative final monograph indicates that the FDA has not made a final determination about products in a category to establish safety and efficacy for a product and its uses.  However, unless there is a serious safety or efficacy issue, the FDA typically will exercise enforcement discretion and permit companies to sell products conforming to a tentative final monograph until the final monograph is published.  Products that comply with either final or tentative final monograph standards do not require pre-market approval from the FDA.
Certain of our U.S. OTC drug products are New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) products and are manufactured and labeled in accordance with a FDA-approved submission. These products are subject to reporting requirements as set forth in FDA regulations.
Certain of our U.S. OTC Healthcare products are medical devices regulated by the FDA through a system that may involve pre-market clearance.  During the review process, the FDA makes an affirmative determination as to the sufficiency of the label directions, cautions and warnings for the medical devices in question.
Certain of our products are considered cosmetics regulated by the FDA through the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDC Act") and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. FDA does not require pre-market clearance but seeks to insure the products are not adulterated or misbranded. 
In accordance with the FDC Act and FDA regulations, we and our third party manufacturers of U.S. products must also comply with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMPs”).  The FDA inspects our facilities and those of our third party manufacturers periodically to determine that both we and our third party manufacturers are complying with GMPs.
A number of our products are regulated by the CPSC under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (the “FHSA”), the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 (the “PPPA”) and the Consumer Products Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (the “CPSIA”).  In addition, a small number of our products are subject to regulation under the PPPA and can only be legally marketed if they are dispensed in child-resistant packaging or labeled for use in households where there are no children.  The CPSIA requires us to make available to our customers certificates stating that we are in compliance with any applicable regulation administered by the CPSC. 
Nix Lice Control Spray is considered a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”).  Generally speaking, any substance intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest is considered to be a pesticide under FIFRA. Pesticides under FIFRA are required to be registered with the EPA and contain certain disclosures on the product labels.  In addition, the contract manufacturers from which we source these products must be registered with the EPA.  Our EPA registered products are also subject to state regulations and the rules and regulations of the various jurisdictions where these products are sold.
Our international business is also subject to product regulations by local regulatory authorities in the various regions where these businesses operate, including regulations regarding manufacturing, labeling, distribution, sale and storage.
Other Regulations
We are also subject to a variety of other regulations in various foreign markets, including regulations pertaining to import/export and antitrust issues.  To the extent we decide to commence or expand operations in additional countries, we may be required to obtain an approval, license or certification from the country’s ministry of health or comparable agency.  We must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that may vary from country to country.  Government regulations in both our domestic and international markets can delay or prevent the introduction, or require the reformulation or withdrawal, of some of our products.  Our failure to comply with these regulations can also result in a product being removed from sale in a particular market, either temporarily or permanently.  In addition, we are subject to FTC and state regulations, as well as foreign regulations, relating to our product claims and advertising.  If we fail to comply with these regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions and the imposition of penalties.

Intellectual Property
We own a number of trademark registrations and applications in the United States, Canada and other foreign countries.  The following are some of the most significant registered trademarks we own in the United States and/or Canada:  BC, Beano, Boudreaux's Butt Paste, Chloraseptic, Clear Eyes, Compound W, Debrox, DenTek, Dramamine, Fleet, Freeze Off, Gaviscon, Goody's, Little Remedies, Luden's, Monistat, Nix, Summer's Eve and The Doctor’s NightGuard.
Our trademarks and tradenames are how we convey that the products we sell are “brand name” products.  Our ownership of these trademarks and tradenames is very important to our business, as it allows us to compete based on the value and goodwill associated with these marks.  We may also license others to use these marks.  Additionally, we own or license patents on innovative and proprietary technology.  The patents evidence the unique nature of our products, provide us with exclusivity, and afford us protection from the encroachment of others.  None of the patents that we own or license, however, is material to us on a consolidated basis. Enforcing our rights, or the rights of any of our licensors, represented by these trademarks, tradenames and patents is critical to our business and may require significant expense.  If we are not able to effectively enforce our rights, others may be able to dilute our trademarks, tradenames and patents and diminish the value associated with our brands and technologies.
We do not own all of the intellectual property rights applicable to our products.  In those cases where our third party manufacturers own patents that protect our products, we are dependent on them as a source of supply for our products. In addition, we rely on our suppliers for their enforcement of their intellectual property rights against infringing products.
Seasonality
The first quarter of our fiscal year generally is the least profitable quarter due to the increased advertising and promotional spending to support those brands with a summer selling season, such as Clear Eyes products and Compound W.  The level of advertising and promotional campaigns in the third quarter influences sales of our cough/cold products, such as Chloraseptic, Little Remedies, and Luden's, during the fourth quarter cough and cold winter months.  Additionally, the fourth quarter typically has the lowest level of advertising and promotional spending as a percent of revenue. 
Employees
We employed approximately 520 full time and no part time individuals at March 31, 2019. Of our approximately 520 employees, approximately 390 are non-production employees.  None of our employees are a party to a collective bargaining agreement.  Management believes that our relations with our employees are good.
Backlog Orders
We define backlog as orders with requested delivery dates requiring shipment prior to March 31st that were not shipped as of March 31st. We had no significant backlog orders at March 31, 2019 or 2018.
