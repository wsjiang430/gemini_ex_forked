Item 1. | Business
------------+---------

OVERVIEW
 
We were originally incorporated in the state of New York in 1994 as Intelli-Check, Inc. In August 1999, we reincorporated in Delaware. On March 14, 2008, our corporation was renamed Intelli-Check - Mobilisa, Inc. after the consummation of the merger with Mobilisa, Inc. (“Mobilisa”) (references to “Intelli-Check” in this annual report refer to the Company prior to the merger with Mobilisa). At the closing of the merger, our headquarters were moved to Mobilisa’s offices in Port Townsend, Washington. On October 27, 2009, we made a further change in our name to Intellicheck Mobilisa, Inc. On May 4, 2017, with the approval of our shareholders, we changed our name to Intellicheck, Inc. (“Intellicheck,” “we,” “our,” “us,” or “the Company”). On August 31, 2009, the Company acquired 100% of the common stock of Positive Access Corporation (“Positive Access”), a developer of driver license reading technology. The acquisition of Positive Access expanded the Company’s technology portfolio and related product offerings and allowed the Company to reach a larger number of customers through Positive Access’s extensive distribution network. Effective March 19, 2018, we relocated our corporate headquarters from Jericho, New York to Melville, New York. On December 31, 2018, we formally merged the Mobilisa and Positive Access subsidiaries into one corporation under the name Intellicheck, Inc.
 
We are a prominent technology company engaged in developing, integrating and marketing threat identification and identity authentication solutions to address challenges that include retail fraud prevention, law enforcement threat identification, and mobile and handheld access control and security for the government, military and commercial markets. Intellicheck’s products include Retail ID®, a solution for preventing fraud in the retail industry; Age ID®, a smartphone or tablet-based solution for preventing sale of age-restricted products to minors; Law ID® a smartphone-based solution used by law enforcement officers to identify and mitigate threats; and Defense ID®, a mobile and fixed infrastructure solution for threat identification, identity authentication and access control to military bases and other government facilities.
 
We plan to expand our business in the near term by pursuing a strategy designed to increase market share in our existing markets and expand into new product markets that are expected to benefit from fraud prevention, enhanced safety and regulatory compliance. For example, we have extended our technologies into online applications to provide enhanced safety, regulatory compliance and fraud prevention for the billions of transactions that occur online each day. We have also incorporated biometric, facial recognition and other enhancements to several of our current product offerings.
 
We plan to leverage our intellectual property in the markets we are targeting to strengthen our competitive position.
 
Our primary businesses include Identity Systems products, which include commercial applications of identity card reading authentication and government sales of defense security and identity card applications.
 
Our technologies address problems such as:
 

■ | Commercial Fraud and Risk Management – which may lead to economic losses to merchants from check cashing, debit and credit card, e-commerce as well as other types of fraud such as identity theft that principally use fraudulent identification documents as proof of identity; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | Instant Credit Card Approval – retail stores use our technology to scan a driver license at a kiosk or at the Point Of Sale (POS) and send the information to a credit card underwriter to get instant approval for a loyalty-branded credit card. This technique protects consumer data and is significantly more likely to result in a completed transaction compared to in-store personnel asking customers to fill out a paper form; 
■ | Unauthorized Access – our systems and software are designed to increase security and deter terrorism at airports, shipping ports, rail and bus terminals, military installations, high profile buildings and infrastructure where security is a concern; and 
■ | Inefficiencies Associated With Manual Data Entry – by reading encoded data contained in the bar code and magnetic stripe of an identification card with a quick swipe or scan of the card, where permitted by law, customers are capable of accurately and instantaneously inputting information into forms, applications and the like without the errors associated with manual data entry.

IDENTITY CARD READING AND VERIFICATION SECTOR
 
Background on Identification Documentation
 
Driver license
 
The driver license is the most widely used form of government issued photo identification in North America. The Real ID Act, which became federal law in May 2005, recognizes that the driver license is also a quasi-identification card. In addition to its primary function, the driver license is used to verify identity for social services, firearm sales, check cashing, credit card issuance and use and other applications. Our technology can read the electronically stored information on all currently issued driver licenses (even those that do not comply with the AAMVA/ANSI/ISO standards). Today, all 50 states, the District of Columbia and all 13 Canadian provinces/territories electronically store information on their driver license.
 
Non-driver identification card
 
Each U.S. and Canadian Jurisdiction also provides a non-driver identification card as an alternative form of identification for those unable to acquire a driver license. These identification cards are issued with most of the same data found on a driver license. Military documents also provide a means of identification and contain encoded data as well. Since driver licenses are the most widely used form of legally acceptable government documentation, we refer to all these identification documents as “driver licenses.” Our ID Check® software can perform its function on all these forms of identification.
 
Current Challenges Associated with Verifying Identification Documents
 
The high-tech revolution has created a major problem for those who rely on identification documents. In an age where scanners, computers and color printers are commonplace, fake IDs of the highest quality are easily obtainable from many locations including college campuses and from multiple sites on the Internet. These fakes appear so real, even law enforcement agencies have encountered difficulty distinguishing them from legally issued documents. Additionally, these high-tech devices can easily alter properly issued ID. Therefore, anyone can gain access to a false identity that gives them the ability, in a commercial transaction, to present fake and stolen credit cards or checks that are supported by false identification. Additionally, starting with only a fraudulent driver license, an individual may be able to create multiple identities, commit fraud, buy age restricted products such as alcohol and tobacco while underage, evade law enforcement and engage in other criminal activities, such as:

● | committing identity theft; | ● | gaining entrance to high profile buildings and sensitive infrastructures, 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | improperly boarding airplanes; | ● | engaging in medical fraud; 
● | committing credit card, debit card and check cashing fraud; | ● | purchasing age restricted products such as alcohol and tobacco while under age; and 
● | illegally purchasing firearms; | ● | obtaining welfare or other government benefits. 
● | unlawfully committing pharmacy fraud, including false narcotic prescriptions; | | 
● | committing refund fraud; | | 

 
Given the ease with which identification can be falsified, simply looking at a driver license may not be sufficient to verify age or identity and determine if it is fraudulent. Since merchants are facing significant economic losses due to these frauds, we believe that a document authentication system which can accurately read the electronically stored information is needed. We possess patented technology that provides an analysis of the data contained on the encoded formats of these identification documents by reading and analyzing the encoded format on the magnetic stripe or bar code on the driver license and comparing it against known standards.

ID Check® Family — Solutions and Benefits
 
Our ID Check® technology is our advanced document verification software. ID Check® is contained in our software products and is capable of reading and verifying in one swipe or scan the encoded format contained on U.S. and Canadian driver licenses, state issued non-driver identification cards, and military IDs. Our technology has the ability to verify the encoded formats on all currently encoded documents, even those that do not comply with the standards of the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (‘‘AAMVA’’), the American National Standards Institute (‘‘ANSI’’) and the International Standards Organization (‘‘ISO’’).
 
We believe that ID Check® and our family of software solutions contain the most advanced, reliable and effective technology, providing users with an easy, reliable, and cost-effective method of document and age verification. We have received/acquired encoding formats from multiple sources. This information, combined with our proprietary technology, enables all our ID Check® software products to read, decode, process and verify the encoded formats on driver licenses. As jurisdictions change their documents and guidelines, we believe our software can be adapted to these changes.
 
The ID Check® technology is embedded in many of our product lines including Retail ID® Law ID® Defense ID®, Age ID®, Guest ID®, Access ID™, and PORT ID™ some of which are discussed below.
 
ID Check® software does not require a connection to a central database to operate, thus negating privacy concerns. Many of our products have the ability to operate add-on peripherals such as printers, fingerprint readers and other devices.
 
The ID Check® process is quick, simple and easy to use. After matching the driver license photograph to the person presenting the document for identification, the user simply scans or swipes the driver license through a data capture device. The software quickly determines if:
 

■ | the format of the document is valid; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | the document has been altered or is fake, by displaying the parsed, encoded data for comparison with the printed information; 
■ | the document has expired; and 
■ | the encoded data contains a date of birth equal to or greater than the legal age to purchase age restricted products, such as alcohol, vaping, cannabis and tobacco. 

 
Then, the ID Check® software applications can:
 

■ | respond to the user by displaying the format verification result and the parsed information; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | save information that is permissible by law to memory; and 
■ | print a record of the transaction including the verification results if a printer is part of the hardware configuration.

State Aware Software
 
State Aware Software provides or restricts information that is electronically scanned from an ID based on the electronic reading laws according to the state in which the ID is scanned. For example, scanning an ID in New Hampshire for law enforcement purposes is allowed, whereas electronically scanning an ID for a mailing list is not allowed. With all the various uses of scanning and verifying an ID, it is important for responsible users to be aware of the different state laws. State Aware Software incorporates each state’s requirements around electronic capture of ID barcode data directly into hosted ID Check software.
Data Collection Devices
 
Our software products are designed for use with multiple data collection devices, which are commercially available in various compact forms and may contain either one or both of 2-D bar code and magnetic stripe readers. These devices enable our software applications to be used on a variety of commercially available data processing devices, including credit card terminals, PDAs, tablets, laptops, desktops and point-of-sale terminals. Many of these devices contain an electronic serial number (ESN) to prevent unauthorized use of our software.
Instant Credit Application Kiosk Software Applications
 
These are custom software applications that Intellicheck Mobilisa has developed for a variety of major financial service companies and retail stores. The software installed on multiple kiosk devices provides the customers of the major financial service companies and retail stores with the ability to perform in-store instant credit approval on these devices. The hardware platforms, on which the software applications run, range from stationary devices to handhelds to tablet PCs. The process involves the swiping or scanning of the driver license to verify the encoded format and after verification, the information parsed from the encoded data is populated into the proper fields on the application displayed on the kiosk. The applicant then completes the application by entering the remaining required information that is not encoded on the driver license, such as social security and telephone numbers. The software application then sends the data to the financial service company’s backend ‘‘decisioning’’ tool for credit approval. If approved, the applicant is granted instant credit which can then be used to make purchases.
Upgrade Capability
 
Our ID Check® Products and related databases are constantly updated to stay current with identification formats and new forms of ID.

Our Target Industry Sectors
 
Commercial Identity Systems
 
The use of false identification cards, primarily driver licenses and non-driver identification cards, to engage in commercial fraud, to gain access to unauthorized areas and to gain entry to critical infrastructure is all too common and the problem is growing with each passing day. Given the ease with which identification can be falsified, we believe that simply looking at a driver license is not sufficient to verify identity and determine if such an identification card is fraudulent. Since merchants are facing significant economic losses due to these frauds, we believe that what they need is a document authentication system that can accurately read the electronically stored information. We target the industry sectors that would most benefit from our systems and software.
 
We also market our products to opportunities where our ID Check® technology can be used to enhance productivity. We have made significant progress in the sectors for the retail issuance of instant credit. We believe there are financial benefits and compelling business models for customers in this sector to utilize our technology.

Government Identity Systems
 
Our Defense ID® system is tailored to locations that validate identification cards as a means of access. Historically, the military sector has been the primary focus, followed closely by sea ports, oil refineries and the law enforcement sector. Military bases, for example, are an ideal location for the use of the Defense ID® system because individual ID cards are checked prior to allowing base access and, in most cases, bases issue visitor/vendor passes to individuals needing access that do not possess a military ID.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
 
Commercial Identity Systems
 
Our objective is to become a leading developer and distributor of document and age verification products. To date, our marketing efforts have been through direct sales by our sales and marketing personnel, through resellers and license agreements. We are marketing our products through direct marketing approaches such as web marketing, a small number of select trade shows and well known public interest and trade associations.
 
We generate revenues from the licensing of our software and the selling of bundled solutions that contain hardware and software. Depending on the specific needs of our clients, we tailor the right solution for them. Our bundled solutions are sold on a SaaS basis.
 
Our ID Check® software is available to customers via the cloud (SaaS) and available for Microsoft Windows and Windows Mobile platforms, Android and iOS in addition to devices such as credit card terminals and other operating systems such as Linux. We are marketing our ID Check® technology to the financial institutions, mass merchandisers, government, airlines, airports, high profile buildings or infrastructure, grocery, convenience and pharmacy chains, and casinos.
 
We have developed a comprehensive marketing plan to build customer awareness and develop brand recognition in our target industry sectors. We promote the advantages and ease of use of our products through:
 

■ | Endorsements by nationally known public interest groups and trade associations; | ■ | Web seminars, as well as our own website; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---+--------------------------------------------------------
■ | Trade publications; | ■ | Various conventions and industry specific seminars. 
■ | Trade shows; | | 

 
We intend to continue to develop and market other related software applications.
 
Government Identity Solutions
 
We have sector-specific brochures for each product in our product line for both the military, port and law enforcement sectors that the sales force utilizes when demonstrating the Defense ID® system to potential customers. These brochures serve as a quick reference guide outlining the capabilities of our technology. Once customers have a clear understanding of our products, they can use these brochures to discuss their individual needs and ordering requirements.

11
--


When dealing with military and government entities, we must comply with applicable procurement regulations.
 
In addition to sole source awards, we also respond to Requests for Proposal (“RFPs”) and Requests for Qualifications (“RFQs”) when our technological capabilities meet that of the desired system. In many cases, we are the only company that can meet the requirements in the RFP, which can lead to a quick and easy award.
 
Also, we have all Defense ID® products, as well as individual labor services, listed on GSA Schedule 70. This makes it possible for government entities to make direct purchases of equipment and services for a pre-negotiated price without having to go through the formal RFP/Bid process.
 
We have our corporate headquarters in Melville, New York to fully support our current and potential customers.
 
MAJOR CUSTOMERS
 
Although the composition of our largest customers has changed from year to year, a significant portion of our revenues have been attributable to a limited number of major customers. In 2018, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 52% of total revenues. In 2017, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 57% of total revenues. While we believe that one or more major customers could account for a significant portion of our sales for at least the next two years, we anticipate that our customer base will continue to expand and that in the future we will be less dependent on major customers.
REGULATION 
 
The sale and use of our Identity System products are subject to regulation, such as on data protection and storage, by government authorities. We work on an ongoing basis with our customers to facilitate their compliance with such regulations. We believe we are currently in compliance with applicable United States, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment.
 
COMPETITION
 
Commercial Identity Systems
 
We compete in an industry that is intensely competitive and rapidly changing. Unless a device can read, decode and analyze all the information that is legally permitted to be analyzed, which is electronically stored on a driver license, the user may not obtain accurate and reliable confirmation that a driver license is valid and has not been altered or tampered with. We are aware of several companies that are currently offering products that electronically read and calculate age from a driver license. We have tested and compared some of these products to ID Check® and believe that our product is superior in quality and functionality. We believe that units unable to read bar codes are at a significant disadvantage because all states and Canadian provinces currently utilize bar codes to encode their driver licenses, as well as all U.S. military IDs and uniformed services cards.
 
In the government identity sector, there are several companies, including Idemia USA and HID Global that are currently offering products that compete with the Defense ID® system. The U.S. government also has DBIDS and AIE that compete with our products.
 
We are also aware that Zebra and Honeywell are offering an embedded driver’s license reading solution on a tether scanner. The solutions simply read the barcode as opposed to authenticating.
 
We have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition in the document verification sector. If any of our competitors were to become the industry standard or were to enter or expand relationships with significantly larger companies through mergers, acquisitions or otherwise, our business and operating results could be seriously harmed. In addition, potential competitors could bundle their products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products.

MANUFACTURING
 
We do not manufacture readers or input devices, but use products from several manufacturers. Some of these devices are private labeled and programmed by the supplier to work with our ID Check® technology. Most of our hardware consists of commercial off-the-shelf (“COTS”) products. We rely on a small number of suppliers to provide our COTS products.
 
Our government identity systems products are created with COTS items that we customize with software and specialized configurations. All products are customized, assembled, and tested in-house and then installed and placed by our employees in the field.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
Our research and development (“R&D”) efforts are mainly concentrated in two areas. The most significant effort is concentrated in the identity sector. We modify existing software applications based on customer’s requirements, which are fee based. In addition, we develop new software solutions and make improvements to existing software platforms, which are funded internally. R&D spending during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $2,904,166 and $1,916,107, respectively.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
We currently hold sixteen (16) U.S. patents, one (1) Canadian patent and one (1) United Kingdom patent. At present, we have six patent applications pending in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as well as internationally. These patents cover commercially important aspects of our capabilities relating to the authentication and verification of identification documents, and relating to our Defense ID® System technology. We will continue to pursue patents for all of our new technologies arising from our research and development efforts.
 
In January 1999, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted us a patent on our ID Check® software technology. In October 2002, we were granted another patent relating to our document authentication and age verification technology. In January 2009, we were granted another patent that is a continuation of our patents relating to our document authentication and age verification technology. Upon our acquisition of the assets of IDentiScan, we also received equitable ownership and sole ownership rights to its intellectual property, including other patents and patent applications relating to age verification technology.
 
During 2010, we were granted two additional patents. The first patent was for a software key control for mobile devices. It is used to get a registration key for the parser that is based on the unique internal ID of one mobile device. The Mobile Key Manager communicates with the mobile device, reading its ID, and then requests a registration key specific for that ID from Intellicheck Mobilisa’s server. This server maintains a database of all customers using IDecode Mobile Parsers, including the number of licenses they have purchased, the latest software version for which they have paid support, and the registration keys and unique device IDs associated with those licenses. The server generates a new registration key unique to the device ID and returns it to the Mobile Key Manager to register that device. In this way, the customer can deploy the IDecode Mobile Parser to only one mobile device for each parser purchased.
 
The second patent was related to a document comparison system and reinforces the innovative nature of Intellicheck’s security solutions involving documents. The technology described in the patent relates to a system and method for comparing information contained in at least two documents. For example, information on at least two different documents can be compared to determine whether the information is the same on each document. For instance, a name contained on an individual’s driver’s license is automatically compared with a name contained on the individual’s airline boarding pass.

In 2011, we were issued another patent. This patent allows for verifying and authenticating the encoded information on driver licenses of all 50 states and other North American driver licenses and allows the information to be electronically transferred in a secure environment to a local or remote jurisdiction for age verification, organ donor, or criminal activity checks critical in fighting both crime and terrorism.
 
In 2012, we were granted a patent relating to a system and method for comparing information contained in at least two documents, but not limited to just a driver license and passport. This patent compares “like information” on different documents to determine whether the information is the same on each document. As an example, a passport is compared to a boarding pass to determine if “like information” matches, for instance name and birthdate.
 
We were also granted a patent related to a system that uses environmental information to determine a level of scrutiny that is to be applied to identification information received at a location where user identification is being checked. Depending on the level of scrutiny that is applied and on generated candidate scores, the system will display many potential persons of interest that match the received identification information.
 
In 2013, we were granted four patents that are continuations of earlier-filed applications we previously filed. One patent is related to a document comparison system that compares information contained in two documents to determine whether the information is substantially identical on each document. An indication is provided as to whether the two documents identify the same entity or do not identify the same entity. The second patent relates to improvements to software key control for mobile devices. The third patent relates to an apparatus for extracting date of birth information from driver’s licenses and displaying a calculated age along with a license background graphic. Finally, the fourth patent is related to a system that uses environmental information to determine a level of scrutiny that is to be applied to identification information received at a location and to display many potential persons of interest that match the received identification information based on the applied level of scrutiny.
 
In 2014, we were granted one patent that was also a continuation of an earlier-filed application. The patent is related to a document comparison system that compares information contained in two documents to determine whether certain information is substantially identical on each document. The system provides a positive or negative indication as to whether portions of the two documents are substantially identical.
 
In 2015, we acquired an intellectual property portfolio that includes four patents involving technologies for checking the validity of identification documents using a remote database. Certain patents in this portfolio address the use of biometric information and identification credentials as part of the process to control access to a secured area.
 
We were also granted two patents in 2015. The first patent is related to a system and method for comparing documents. The second patent is identity matching in response to threat levels.
 
We were also granted two patents in 2016 in Canada. The first patent is related to a system and method for comparing documents. The second patent is related to identity matching in response to threat levels.
 
We were granted one patent in 2017 that was also a continuation of an earlier filed application. The patent is related to checking the validity of identification documents using a remote database.
 
In 2018, we were granted one patent that was also a continuation of an earlier filed application to a document comparison that compares information contained in documents.


We own multiple copyrights in the United States, which are effective in Canada and in other major industrial countries. The copyright protection covers software source codes and supporting graphics relating to the operation of ID Check® and other software products. We also have several trademarks relating to our company, its product names and logos.
 
In connection with the sales or licensing of our intellectual property, we have entered into an agreement with a former officer, under which we will pay royalties equal to 0.005% of cumulative gross sales for cumulative gross sales of $2,000,000 to $52,000,000 and 0.0025% of cumulative gross sales for cumulative gross sales more than $52,000,000 pertaining to those patents on which this former officer was identified as an inventor. Cumulatively through December 31, 2018 total fees paid under this agreement were approximately $2,000.
 
Employees 
 
As of March 21, 2019, we had thirty-four full-time employees. Three are engaged in executive management, nineteen in information technology, nine in sales and marketing and three in administration. All employees are employed “at will.” We believe our relations with our employees are generally positive and we have no collective bargaining agreements with any labor unions.
