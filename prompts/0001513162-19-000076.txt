Item 1.   Business
Company Overview and History
 
Nuvera is a diversified communications company headquartered in New Ulm, Minnesota with more than 113 years of experience in the local telephone exchange and communications business. We operate in one principal business segment: the Communications Segment.
 
Our principal line of business is the operation of six local telephone companies or incumbent local exchange carriers (ILEC) and the operation of two competitive local exchange carriers (CLEC) telephone companies. Our original business was founded in 1905 and consisted of the operation of a single ILEC (New Ulm Rural Telephone Company). In 1984, we changed our name to New Ulm Telecom, Inc. In 1986, we acquired our second ILEC, Western Telephone Company (WTC). In 1993, we acquired our third ILEC, Peoples Telephone Company (PTC). In 2008, we acquired our fourth ILEC, Hutchinson Telephone Company (HTC). In 2012, we acquired our fifth ILEC, Sleepy Eye Telephone Company (SETC). In 2018, we acquired our sixth ILEC, Scott-Rice Telephone Co. (Scott-Rice). Our businesses consist of connecting customers to our state-of-the-art, fiber-rich communications network, providing managed services, switched service and dedicated private lines, connecting customers to long distance service providers and providing many other services associated with our businesses. Our businesses also provide Internet protocol television (IPTV), cable television services (CATV), Internet access services, including high-speed broadband access, and long distance service. We also install and maintain communications systems to the areas in and around our service territories in southern Minnesota and northern Iowa. In 2002, we formed a CLEC in the city of Redwood Falls, Minnesota and acquired our second CLEC in 2008 with the acquisition of HTC. This CLEC operates in and around the city of Litchfield, Minnesota. In 2010, we acquired the cable TV system in the city of Glencoe and operate Glencoe under the Litchfield CLEC. Our CLECs offer the same services as our ILECs. In 2000, we changed our marketing name to NU-Telecom and operated under that name in our markets. In 2018, we changed our marketing name to Nuvera and currently operate under that name in our markets.
 
Recent Business Developments
 
On July 31, 2018, the Company announced that it had completed its acquisition of Scott-Rice from Allstream Business U.S., LLC, an affiliate of Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. (Zayo) for approximately $42 million in cash. Scott-Rice provides voice, video and Internet services with more than 18,000 connections, serving the communities of Prior Lake, Savage, Elko and New Market, Minnesota. The combined Nuvera/Scott-Rice Company has approximately 66,000 connections. Nuvera financed the acquisition with its principal lender CoBank, ACB (CoBank). Further information regarding the CoBank loan terms and amounts can be found on the Companys 8-K filed with the SEC on August 3, 2018.

We report the business operations of our six ILECs and two CLECs and their associated services as a single segment that we refer to as the Communications Segment.  
 
The Communications Segment operates the following ILECs: Nuvera, HTC, PTC, Scott-Rice, SETC and WTC and two CLECs located in the cities of Redwood Falls, Litchfield and Glencoe, Minnesota. Nuvera, HTC, Scott-Rice, SETC and WTC are independent telephone companies that are regulated by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission at the state level, while PTC is an independent telephone company that is regulated by the Iowa Utilities Board at the state level. Our two CLECs are currently not under the same level of regulatory oversight as our ILECs. As of December 31, 2018 we served 26,940 access lines in the Minnesota communities of Bellechester, Courtland, Elko, Evan, Goodhue, Hanska, Hutchinson, Klossner, Litchfield, Mazeppa, New Market, New Ulm, Prior Lake, Redwood Falls, Sanborn, Savage, Searles, Sleepy Eye, Springfield and White Rock, as well as the adjacent rural areas of Blue Earth, Brown, Goodhue, McLeod, Meeker, Nicollet, Redwood, Rice, Scott and Wabasha counties in south central Minnesota. We also serve the community of Aurelia, Iowa as well as the adjacent rural areas surrounding Aurelia. The Communications Segment also operates multiple IPTV and CATV systems in Minnesota (including the cities of Cologne, Courtland, Elko, Glencoe, Goodhue, Hanska, Hutchinson, Litchfield, Mayer, New Market, New Germany, New Ulm, Plato, Prior Lake, Redwood Falls, Sanborn, Savage, Sleepy Eye and Springfield) and one IPTV system in Aurelia, Iowa. These systems serve 12,288 customers.  
 
The Communications Segment derives its principal revenues from (i) local service charges to its residential and business subscribers, (ii) access charges to Interexchange Carriers (IXCs) for providing the carriers access to our local phone networks and (iii) the provisioning of video and data services. 
 
Neither our ILECs nor CLECs are dependent upon any single customer or small group of customers. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues in any of the last two years.
 
We provide a variety of business communication services to small, medium and large business customers, including many services over our advanced fiber network. The services we offer include scalable high speed broadband Internet access and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) phone services, which range from basic service plans to virtual hosted systems. Our hosted VoIP package utilizes our soft switching technology and enables our customers to have the flexibility of employing new telephone advances and features without investing in a new telephone system. This package bundles local service, calling features, IP business telephones and unified messaging, which integrates multiple technologies into a single system and allows the customer to receive and listen to voice messages through e-mail.  
 
In addition to Internet and VoIP services, we also offer a variety of commercial data connectivity services in select markets including private line and Ethernet services to provide high bandwidth across point-to-point and multiple site networks.
 
We receive the majority of our revenues through the following sources:
 
Local Service  We receive recurring revenue for basic local services that enable end-user customers to make and receive telephone calls within a defined local calling area for a flat monthly fee. In addition to subscribing to basic local telephone services, our customers may choose from a variety of custom calling features such as call waiting, call forwarding, caller identification and voicemail. Our VoIP digital phone service is also available as an alternative to the traditional telephone line. We offer multiple voice services plans with customizable calling features and voicemail. 
 
6
   

Network Access  We provide access services to other communications carriers for the use of our facilities to terminate or originate long distance calls on our network. Additionally, we bill subscriber line charges (SLCs) to substantially all of our customers for access to the public switched network. These monthly SLCs are regulated and approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In addition, network access revenue is derived from several federally administered pooling arrangements designed to provide support and distribute funding to the ILECs.  
 
Video  We provide a variety of enhanced video services on a monthly recurring basis to our customers. Depending on geographical market availability, our video services range from limited basic service to advanced digital TV, which includes several plans each with hundreds of local, national music channels including premium and pay-per-view channels as well as video-on-demand service. Certain customers may also subscribe to our advanced video services, which consist of high-definition (HD) TV, digital video recorders (DVR) and Whole Home DVR. Our Whole Home DVR allows customers the ability to watch recorded shows on any TV in the house, record multiple shows at one time and utilize an intuitive on-screen guide and user interface. Video subscribers also have access to our TV Everywhere service which allows subscriber access to full episodes of available shows, movies and live screens using a computer or mobile device. We also receive monthly recurring revenue from our subscribers for providing commercial TV programming in competition with local CATV, satellite dish TV and off-air TV service providers. We serve twenty-two communities with our IPTV services and five communities with our CATV services. 
 
Data  We provide high speed Internet access to business and residential customers depending on the nature of the network facilities that are available, the level of service selected and the location. Our revenue is earned based on the offering of various flat rate packages based on the level of service, data speeds and features. We also provide e-mail and managed services, such as web hosting and design, on-line file back up and on-line file storage. 
 
Alternative Connect America Cost Model (A-Cam)/Federal Universal Service Fund (FUSF)  Prior to 2017, we received FUSF funding from the FCC. FUSF funding was established to overcome geographical differences in costs of providing voice service and to enable all citizens to communicate over networks regardless of geographical location and/or personal income. In our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, Nuvera disclosed that we had elected the A-CAM for our Minnesota and Iowa operations, replacing our former legacy support. Nuvera will receive A-CAM support for a period of ten years in exchange for meeting defined broadband build-out requirements. On May 7, 2018, the FCC issued Public Notice DA 18-465, which contained revised offers of A-CAM support and associated revised service deployment obligations. See pages 12-15 for a discussion regarding A-CAM and FUSF.
 
With the acquisition of Scott-Rice on July 31, 2018, see Note 3  Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Nuvera now receives FUSF support for Scott-Rice. The remainder of the Company receives funding from A-CAM. Scott-Rices settlements from the National Exchange Carriers Association (NECA) pools are based on nationwide average schedules. 
 
Other  Our customers are billed for toll and long-distance services on either a per call or flat-rate basis. This also includes the offering of directory assistance, operator service and long distance private lines. We also generate revenue from directory publishing, sales and service of customer premise equipment (CPE), bill processing and other customer services. Our directory publishing revenue in our telephone directories recurs monthly. We also provide retail sales and service of cellular phones and accessories through Telespire, a national wireless provider. We resell these wireless services as Nuvera Wireless, our branded product. We receive both recurring revenue for our wireless services, as well as revenue collected for the sale of wireless phones and accessories.

Strategy
 
Our vision is to position ourselves as a one-stop communications solutions provider. We believe our customers place a value on the fact that we are a local company whose goal is to meet our customers total communications needs. The success of this vision depends on the following strategies:
 
·      We market services to our residential customers either individually or as a bundled package. We offer a competitive, multi-service bundle of voice, high-speed Internet and IPTV. Data connections continue to increase as a result of consumer trends towards increased Internet usage and our enhanced product and service offerings.
 
·      Our consumer broadband speed allows us to continue to meet the needs of our customers and the demand for higher speed resulting from the growing trend of over-the-top content viewing. The availability of faster speeds also complements our wireless home networking (Wi-Fi) and supports our TV everywhere service and allows our subscribers to watch their favorite programs at home or away on a computer, smartphone or tablet.
 
·      We tailor our services to commercial customers by developing solutions to fit their specific needs. We provide services to a wide range of commercial customers from sole proprietors and other small businesses to multi-location corporations. Our business suite of services includes local and long-distance calling plans, hosted voice services using network servers, the added capacity for multiple phone lines, scalable broadband Internet, online back up and business directory listings. 
 
·      We believe that we have several advantages over our competition, including a state-of-the-art, fiber-rich communications network, competitive pricing and costs, outstanding service quality, a strong reputation, a high level of commitment to the communities we serve and a direct billing relationship with a vast majority of the customers we serve in our service territories. We manage the potential decline in communications network access and local service revenues by offering value-added services such as higher Internet speeds, HD IPTV, DVR services, managed services, customized communications solutions, along with outstanding customer service as a competitive differentiator. 
 
·      We have and will continue to upgrade our networks and enhance our products and services to take advantage of the latest technology including advanced high-bandwidth capabilities and services, expansion of our network for wholesale and retail customers, Fiber-to-the-Tower services for wireless carriers and last mile fiber builds to residential and business customers. We intend to continue to introduce new services that draw upon our core competencies and we believe are attractive to our target customers. In considering new services, we look for market opportunities that we believe present growth opportunities. 
 
·      We continue to seek ways to improve our internal processes and gain operational efficiencies. While focusing resources on revenue growth and market share gains, we continually challenge our management team and employees at all levels to seek efficiencies and enhance our customers experience. We continue to invest in our networks and train our employees to achieve customer service excellence. 
 
·      Our current customer base provides a recurring revenue stream generating stable cash flow. Our focus remains on growing our services and supporting product lines so as to generate sufficient cash flow to fund our current operations, service our debt, fund our capital expenditure needs, pay dividends and expand our business. We have allocated resources to maintain and upgrade our network while focusing on optimizing returns by completing strategic capital outlays that will make our network more efficient and cost effective while providing the products and services that our customers desire in the markets we serve.
 
·      We intend to continue to pursue a disciplined process of evaluating acquisitions of businesses as well as organic growth opportunities of market expansion and/or products which are complementary to our business portfolio.

Competition
 
We compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry, and expect competition will continue to intensify as consolidations and mergers occur within the industry. Regulatory developments and technological advances over the past several years have increased opportunities for alternative communications service providers, which in turn have increased competitive pressures on our business. These alternative providers often face fewer regulations and have lower cost structures than we do. In addition, several of our competitors have consolidated with other communication providers and as a result are generally larger, have more financial and business resources and have greater geographical reach to provide services. Our competitive advantages include: our strong commitment and presence in the communities we serve, knowledge of these markets, our experienced local service and support team, and our ability to offer more flexible communications solutions than our larger competitors. 
 
The long-range effect of competition on the delivery of communications services and equipment will depend on technological advances, regulatory actions at both the federal and the state levels, court decisions, and possible additional future federal and state legislation. Past federal and state legislation have tended to expand competition in the communications industry.  
 
Alternatives to our service include customers leasing private line switched voice and data services in or adjacent to our service territories that permit the bypassing of our communications facilities. In addition, microwave transmission services, wireless communications, fiber-optic/coaxial cable deployment, VoIP, satellite and other services also permit the bypassing of our local exchange network. These alternatives to local exchange service represent a potential threat to our long-term ability to provide local exchange services at economical rates. 
 
In order to meet the competition present in our industry, our businesses have deployed new technology to enable our local exchange networks to capture operating efficiencies and to provide additional new services to our new and existing customer base. These new technologies include the latest release of digital switching technology for all of our switches and the installation of a Common Channel Signaling System No. 7 (SS7) out-of-band system for all of our access lines. Our businesses have also connected fiber rings (redundant route designs that allow traffic to be re-routed in the event of network problems) that protect our local networks and enable them to provide a reliable level of service to our customers. The value of our local network is also enhanced by the ability of our operating companies to offer access to high-speed Internet with broadband access to our access lines. Broadband technology allows customer access to high-speed Internet and traditional voice connectivity over the same connection. In addition, our businesses have further enhanced our networks to allow the offering of video services over the same facilities that provide our customers with voice and Internet access. This technology is available to approximately 93% of our access lines.
 
We compete as a CLEC in the cities of Redwood Falls, Litchfield and Glencoe, Minnesota. Our two CLECs are currently not under the same level of regulatory oversight as our ILECs. CenturyLink is the existing ILEC in these markets. Competition also exists in the other communities and areas served by our businesses for traditional telephone service from wireless communications providers and we also expect competition to increase from service providers offering VoIP. We experience competition in the Minnesota communities of Elko, Glencoe, Hutchinson, Litchfield, New Market, New Ulm, Prior Lake, Redwood Falls, Savage, Sleepy Eye and Springfield in the provisioning of video services. Comcast is the existing incumbent provider of video services in the New Ulm market. Mediacom is the existing incumbent provider of video services in the Elko, Hutchinson, Litchfield, New Market, Prior Lake, Redwood Falls, Savage, Sleepy Eye and Springfield markets. Several other communications providers compete with us in our markets in providing Internet services. Our businesses have responded to these competitive pressures by creating active programs to market our products, bundle our services and enhance our infrastructure to create higher customer value. 
 
As of December 31, 2018 we served 26,940 access lines in the Minnesota communities of Bellechester, Courtland, Elko, Evan, Goodhue, Hanska, Hutchinson, Klossner, Litchfield, Mazeppa, New Market, New Ulm, Prior Lake, Redwood Falls, Sanborn, Savage, Searles, Sleepy Eye, Springfield and White Rock, as well as the adjacent rural areas of Blue Earth, Brown, Goodhue, McLeod, Meeker, Nicollet, Redwood, Rice, Scott and Wabasha counties in south central Minnesota. We also serve the community of Aurelia, Iowa as well as the adjacent rural areas surrounding Aurelia. The Communications Segment also operates multiple IPTV and CATV systems in Minnesota (including the cities of Cologne, Courtland, Elko, Glencoe, Goodhue, Hanska, Hutchinson, Litchfield, Mayer, New Market, New Germany, New Ulm, Plato, Prior Lake, Redwood Falls, Sanborn, Savage, Sleepy Eye and Springfield) and one IPTV system in Aurelia, Iowa. These systems serve 12,288 customers.

We are experiencing competition for some of our other services from IXCs, such as customer billing services, dedicated private lines and network switching. The provisioning of these services is contractual in nature and is primarily directed by the IXCs. Other services, such as directory advertising, operator services and cellular communications are open to competition, based primarily on service and customer experience. 
 
Materials and Supplies
 
The materials and supplies that are necessary for the operation of our businesses are available from a variety of sources. We are not dependent on any particular supplier or group of affiliated suppliers for our equipment needs. 
Regulation
 
The following summary provides a high-level overview, but may not include all present and proposed federal, state and local legislation and regulations affecting the communications industry. Some legislation and other regulations are currently the subject of judicial proceedings, legislative hearings and administrative proposals that could change the manner in which this industry operates. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these developments or their potential impact on us. Regulation can change rapidly in the communications industry and these changes could have an adverse effect on us in the future.
Overview
 
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), rules and regulations of the SEC and, where applicable, conform to the accounting principles as prescribed by federal and state telephone utility regulatory authorities.
 
The services we offer are subject to varying levels of regulatory oversight. Federal and state regulatory agencies share responsibility for enforcing statutes and rules relative to the provision of communications services. Our interstate communications services are subject to regulation by the FCC. Intrastate services are governed by the relevant state regulatory commission. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (TA96) and the rules enacted under it also gave oversight of interconnection arrangements and access to network elements to the state commissions. Our TV services are governed by FCC rules and municipal franchise agreements. There are also varying levels of regulatory oversight depending on the nature of the services offered or if the services are offered by an ILEC or CLEC.
 
Our CLEC businesses provide services with less regulatory oversight than our ILEC companies. A company must file for CLEC or interexchange authority to operate with the appropriate public utility commission in each state it serves. Our CLECs provide a variety of services to both residential and business customers in multiple jurisdictions.
 
Federal Regulatory Framework
 
All carriers must comply with the Federal Communications Act of 1934 (FCA34) as amended that requires, among other things, that our interstate services be provided at just and reasonable rates and on non-discriminatory terms and conditions. The TA96 amended the FCA34 and has had a dramatic effect on the competitive environment in the communications industry. In addition to these laws, we are also subject to rules promulgated by the FCC and could be affected by any regulatory decisions or orders they issue.
 
10
   

The TA96 and Local Competition 
 
The primary goal of the TA96 and the FCCs rules promulgated under it was to open local communications markets to competition while enhancing universal service. To some extent, Congress pre-empted the local authority of states to oversee local communications services.
 
The TA96 imposes a number of requirements on all local communications providers including: 
 
·         To interconnect directly or indirectly with other carriers;
 
·         To allow others to resell services; 
 
·         To provide for number portability to allow end-users to retain their telephone number when changing providers; 
 
·         To ensure dialing parity; 
 
·         To ensure that competitor customers have non-discriminatory access to telephone numbers, operator services, directory assistance and directory listing services; and 
 
·         To allow competitors access to telephone poles, ducts, conduits and rights-of-way, and to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of communications traffic.
 
Access Charges
 
Access charges refer to the compensation received by local exchange carriers (LECs) for the use of their networks by an IXC. We provide two types of access services: special access and switched access. Special access is provided through dedicated circuits that connect other carriers to our network and is structured on a flat monthly fee basis. Switched access rates that are billed to other carriers are based on a per-minute of use fee basis. The FCC regulates prices that our businesses charge for interstate access charges. There has been a trend toward lowering the rates charged to carriers accessing local networks and the application of a SLC as a flat rate on end-user bills. Regulation, competition, carriers optimizing their network costs and lower demand for dedicated lines have resulted in lower access rates and overall lower minutes of use on our network, which has affected our network access revenues. 
 
Interstate access rates are established by the nationwide pooling of companies known as NECA. The FCC established NECA in 1983 to develop and administer interstate access service rates, terms and conditions. Revenues are pooled and redistributed on the basis of each companys actual or average costs. There has been a change in the composition of interstate access charges in recent years, shifting more of the charges to the end user and reducing the amount of access charges paid by IXCs. We believe this trend will continue.  
 
Wireline Interstate
 
Our ILEC companies participated in the NECA common line pool where end-user common line funds collected were pooled. A portion of our ILEC revenue was based on settlements distributed from this pool. Our ILEC companies also participated in the NECA traffic-sensitive pool. These pool settlements were adjusted periodically. 
 
Interstate access rates for CLECs were established according to an order issued by the FCC in 2001. Under that order, the switched access rates charged by a competitive carrier can be no higher than the rates charged by the ILEC with whom the CLEC competes, unless the CLEC qualifies for the Rural Exemption. 
 
Intercarrier Compensation and FUSF Reform  
 
The FCC released the National Broadband Plan in April 2010 recommending significant changes to the access charge policy and processes. This was followed on November 18, 2011, by FCC Order 11-161 (the Transformation Order), with comprehensive rules reforming all forms of intercarrier compensation and implementing a new support mechanism for the deployment of broadband. Generally, the intercarrier compensation reform sets forth a path towards a bill & keep regime which eliminates compensation for termination of traffic received from another carrier. The timeline for this transition had numerous steps depending on the type of traffic exchanged and the regulated status of the affected LEC.  
 
11
   

These rules have been clarified in several orders on Reconsideration and have had an impact on our companies by reducing our terminating intercarrier compensation, including intrastate and interstate access charges. 
 
The FCC Transformation Order also confirmed the applicability of access charges on VoIP traffic and eliminated reciprocal compensation charges for termination of local wireless traffic. Despite these changes IXCs and others are still quite aggressive in disputing carrier access charges and/or the applicability of access charges to their traffic. 
 
Due to the combination of rate reforms instituted by the FCC, competitive substitution by wireless and other carriers and decreased use of the switched network, the aggregate amount of interstate network access charges paid by long distance carriers to access providers such as our company, has decreased and we project that this decline will continue. For the year ended December 31, 2018, communications network access revenue represented 12.6% of our operating revenue, down from 14.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017. This excludes any funding received from the A-CAM for broadband funding (see pages 14-15 for more information).
 
Federal Universal Service Fund 
 
The FUSF was originally established to overcome geographic differences in costs of providing voice service and to enable all citizens to communicate over networks regardless of geographical location and/or personal income. The FCC established universal service policies at the national level under terms contained in the Telecommunications Act of 1934. The TA96 requires explicit FUSF mechanisms and enlarged the scope of universal service to include four distinct programs:
 
·         High-Cost program that supports local carriers operating in high-cost regions of the country to ensure reasonably based telephone rates;  
 
·         Lifeline (low-income) Subscribers program that includes the Link Up and Lifeline programs that provide support for service initiation and monthly fees and have eligibility based on subscriber income; 
 
·         Rural Health Care Providers program that supports communication services used by rural health care providers and provides them with toll free access to an Internet service provider; and 
 
·         Schools and Libraries program, also called the E-Rate program that provides support funding to schools and libraries for communications services, Internet access and internal connections.
 
In its Transformation Order released November 18, 2011, the FCC adopted rules which dramatically reform the universal service program and intercarrier compensation regime. These rules eliminated the legacy Local Switching support, but also provide for a new Connect America Fund (CAF) support for rate of return carriers to make up some of their access revenue reductions and provide direct support to PriceCap carriers (i.e. the larger, national LECs such as Verizon and AT&T) for broadband build outs. The new rules have caused rates for end users to increase as intercarrier compensation is reduced and the legacy mandate for ubiquitous voice service shifts toward broadband availability as a key outcome of the program.  
 
FUSF high-cost payments are distributed by NECA and are only available to carriers that have been designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier (ETC) by a state commission. Each of our ILECs has been designated as an ETC. CLECs are also eligible to be designated as ETCs if they meet the requirements of the program and meet a public interest standard as determined by the appropriate state regulatory agency. Our CLECs are currently not receiving FUSF support. All ETCs must certify annually to the Universal Service Administrative Company or their appropriate state regulatory commission that the funds they receive from the FUSF are being used in the manner intended. The states must then certify to the FCC which carriers have met this standard. The Transformation Order expands the information that must be reported to the State Commissions to include information on broadband availability, plans for expansion to unserved and underserved areas, in addition to information about voice services. To some extent, these levels of scrutiny make the receipt of a consistent level of FUSF payments each year more difficult to predict.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, we received an aggregate of $1,919,884 from FUSF, consisting of $1,475,748 of CAF support and $411,955 of Broadband Loop Support. In addition, we received $32,181 in true-ups to prior year disbursements from the Federal common line support funding mechanism. Our net FUSF in 2018 comprised 3.4% of our total revenue for the year. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we received an aggregate of $1,434,439 from FUSF, consisting of $1,474,388 of CAF support and consisting of $3,136 for a combination of high cost loop support and safety net additive. In addition, we were assessed $43,085 in true-ups to prior year disbursements from the Federal common line support funding mechanism which reduced our FUSF for 2017. Our net FUSF in 2017 comprised 3.1% of our total revenue for the year. We receive no State universal service funding as the states in which we operate have not established state universal service funding mechanisms.  
 
Effective January 1, 2017 we no longer receive funding from the FUSF based on the pooling and redistribution of revenues based on a companys actual or average costs as described above, but has instead, elected to receive funding based on the A-CAM as described below.
 
With the acquisition of Scott-Rice on July 31, 2018, see Note 3  Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Nuvera now receives FUSF support for Scott-Rice. The remainder of the Company receives funding from A-CAM as mentioned below. Scott-Rices settlements from the NECA pools are based on nationwide average schedules. 
 
A-CAM
 
The FUSF was established as part of the TA96 and provides subsidies to communications providers as means of increasing the availability and affordability of advanced communications services. In 2011, significant reform was introduced, including the creation of the CAF, to help modernize the FUSF and promote support of these communications services in the nations high-cost areas. In 2016, the FCC announced additional reform to further transition the CAF from supporting the provision of voice services to the provision of broadband services. On March 30, 2016, the FCC issued a Report and Order (2016 Order) that adopts the following changes to the FUSF for rate-of-return carriers:
 
·         Establishes a voluntary cost model;  
 
·         Creates specific broadband deployment obligations;  
 
·         Provides a mechanism for support of broadband-only deployment;  
 
·         Gradually reduces the authorized rate-of-return from 11.25 percent to 9.75 percent; 
 
·         Eliminates support in those local areas served by unsubsidized competitors;
 
·         Establishes glide-path transition periods for all the new changes; and 
 
·         Maintains the $2 billion budget established by the 2011 Transformation Order.
 
While the 2011 FUSF Transformation Order established CAF Phase I and CAF Phase II as high-cost support mechanisms for the price-cap carriers (i.e., the larger, national LECs such as Verizon and AT&T), it was not as specific about how subsidies would change for the rate-of-return carriers (i.e., the smaller LECs, including all rural LECs). In contrast, the 2016 Order focuses on the rate-of-return carriers, announces specific changes to existing funding mechanisms as well as a new funding mechanism, and provides rural communications providers with greater certainty about future support. 
 
One of the major changes introduced by the 2016 Order is the creation of the A-CAM, a new CAF support mechanism for rate-of-return carriers. Utilization of the A-CAM is voluntary; and rate-of-return carriers may instead choose to continue relying on the legacy support mechanism known as interstate common line support (ICLS), but now modified and renamed CAF Broadband Loop Support (CAF-BLS). Each carrier must decide which support mechanism to elect, and must choose one or the other, per state.

In our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, Nuvera disclosed that we had elected the A-CAM for our Minnesota and Iowa operations, replacing our former ICLS. Nuvera will receive A-CAM support for a period of ten years in exchange for meeting defined broadband build-out requirements. At the time of Nuveras election, the FCC had not yet determined the final award numbers.  
 
Consistent with the stated disclosure in our Form 10-Q, Nuvera notified the FCC that we would continue to elect the A-CAM program. Under the report that accompanied the FCC December 20, 2016 Public Notice, Nuvera would annually receive (i) $391,896 for our Iowa operations and (ii) $6,118,567 for our Minnesota operations. The Company will use the annual $6.5 million that we receive through the A-CAM program to meet our defined broadband build-out obligations, which the Company is currently completing. The A-CAM payments will replace the Companys former ICLS payments. 
 
On May 7, 2018, the FCC issued Public Notice DA 18-465, which contained revised offers of A-CAM support and associated revised service deployment obligations. 
 
On May 23, 2018, the Companys BOD authorized and directed the Company to accept the FCCs revised offer of A-CAM support and the revised associated service deployment obligations. Under the revised FCC offer Notice, the Company will be entitled to annually receive (i) $489,870 for its Iowa operations, which is a $97,974 increase per year and (ii) $7,648,208 for its Minnesota operations, which is a $1,529,641 increase per year. The Company will use the additional support that it receives through the A-CAM program to continue to meet its defined broadband build-out obligations, which the Company is currently completing. A letter of acceptance to elect the revised A-CAM support was filed by the Company with the FCC on May 24, 2018. The FCC accepted the Companys letter on May 30, 2018. On August 31, 2018 the Company received approximately $3.12 million for the revised A-CAM support. This represented an 18-month true-up for support back to the original election date, and an increased monthly payment representing the new revised A-CAM support offer.
 
Privacy and Data Security Regulation
 
The FCA34 generally restricts the nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of communication company customers personally identifiable information by communication companies, except for rendering service, conducting legitimate business activities related to the service, and responding to legal requests. We are also subject to various state and federal regulations that provide protections for customer proprietary network information (CPNI) related to our voice services. The FCC expects broadband Internet access service providers such as us to take reasonable, good faith steps to comply with existing statutory requirements to protect broadband CPNI and plans to propose new privacy and data security rules for broadband Internet service providers. The FCC has recently imposed substantial civil penalties and remediation obligations on several companies for alleged privacy and data security violations.
 
The Federal Trade Commission exercises authority over privacy protections, generally, using its existing authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices to apply greater restrictions on the collection and use of personally identifiable and other information relating to customers. It also has undertaken numerous enforcement actions against parties that do not provide sufficient security protections against the loss of unauthorized disclosure of this type of information. We also are subject to stringent data security and data retention requirements on website operators and online services. Other privacy-oriented laws have been extended by courts to online video providers and are increasingly being used in privacy lawsuits, including class actions, against providers of video materials online.
 
We are also subject to state and federal laws and regulations regarding data security that primarily apply to sensitive personal information that could be used to commit identity theft. Most states have security breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and government agencies when certain information has been disclosed, due to a security breach, and the FCC has adopted security breach rules for voice services. Several states have also enacted general data security requirements to safeguard consumer information, including the proper disposal of consumer information.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology, in cooperation with other federal agencies and owners and operators of United States critical infrastructure, have developed a voluntary framework that provides a prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-based and cost-effective approach to cybersecurity risk. It is compendiums of existing cross-sector cyber-defense processes, practices and protocols that can help companies identify, assess and manage their cyber risks and vulnerabilities, and several governmental agencies have encouraged compliance with this framework. Additionally, in December 2015, Congress enacted the Cybersecurity Act of 2015, which is intended to encourage and facilitate the sharing of security threat and defensive measure information with government agencies and other companies, in order to strengthen the countrys overall cybersecurity protections. Finally, there are pending legislative proposals that could impose new requirements on owners and operators of critical infrastructure and the FCC is considering expanding its cybersecurity guidelines or adopting new cybersecurity requirements. 
 
Network Architecture and Technology
 
We have made significant investments in our technologically advanced communications networks and continue to enhance and expand our network by deploying technologies to provide additional capacity to our customers. As a result, we are able to deliver high-quality, reliable data, video and voice services in the markets we serve. Our wide-ranging network and extensive use of fiber provide an easy reach into existing and new areas. By bringing the fiber network closer to the customer premises, we can increase our service offerings, quality and bandwidth services. Our existing network enables us to efficiently respond and adapt to changes in technology and is capable of supporting the rising customer demand for bandwidth in order to support the growing amount of wireless data devices in our customers homes and businesses. 
 
Our networks are supported by advanced switches, with a fiber network connecting our exchanges. We continue to enhance our copper network to increase bandwidth in order to provide additional products and services to our marketable homes. In addition to our copper plant enhancements, we have deployed fiber-optic cable extensively throughout our network, resulting in a 100% fiber backbone network that supports all of the inter-office and host-remote links. In addition, this fiber infrastructure provides the connectivity required to provide video service, Internet and long-distance services to residential and commercial customers. Our fiber network utilizes fiber-to-the-home and fiber-to-the-node networks to offer bundled residential and commercial services. 
 
We operate fiber networks which we own for fiber network access. At December 31, 2018, our fiber-optic network consisted of approximately 1,611 route miles, including 873 transport route miles and 738 local route miles.
 
Through our extensive fiber network, we are also able to support the increased demand on wireless carriers for data bandwidth. In all the markets we serve, we have launched initiatives to support fiber backhaul services to cell sites.
 
Environmental Regulation
 
We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials, the release of pollutants into the environment and the remediation of contamination. We could be subject to environmental laws that impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup at a contaminated site, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the activity that resulted in contamination. We believe that our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Employees
 
As of March 1, 2019 we had 172 full-time equivalent employees dedicated to Nuveras operations.
