Market Overview
 
Blockchain
 
The blockchain is a decentralized database or digital “ledger” of transactions across a peer-to-peer network of computers or “nodes” that use the underlying infrastructure of the Internet to validate and process valuable transactions. While using the blockchain, participants can transfer information across the Internet without the need of a central third party. In a financial transaction, the buyer and seller interact directly without the need for verification by a trusted third-party intermediary. The actual record of transaction is pseudonymous, but the identifying information is encrypted, preventing personal information from being shared.
 
The primary benefits of blockchain include the following:
 

● | Fraud reduction: Blockchain technology has the potential to positively disrupt most industries since it can work for nearly every type of transaction that involves value, including money, property and goods. From a business perspective, the technology may be leveraged for process improvement, helping to reduce human error, prevent fraud and streamline data storage. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Transparency: Financial organizations may use the blockchain to store records digitally and leverage the technology for any type of transaction that needs to be verified by a trusted third party. 
● | Security: Transactions may include transferring digital or physical assets, verifying chain of custody and protecting intellectual property. In an era with increasing cybercrime and strict regulatory requirements, blockchain offers a highly fraud resistant technology that can protect and authenticate almost any type of transaction. 
● | Efficiency: Both Permissioned and Public blockchains offer significant improvements in efficiency to retail and business implementations by reducing cost and time in the duplicate databases and ledgers that companies and intermediaries must maintain in the absence of a shared, trusted and immutable system. 

Competition
 
We have a number of competitors, ranging in size, consisting primarily of other similar consulting firms. We believe our main competitors are ConsenSys, Natsoft Corporation, Quest Global Technologies, and CGI Inc. In addition, global audit and assurance firms typically provide consulting services.
Governmental Regulations
 
Government regulation of blockchain is being actively considered by the United States federal government via a number of agencies (including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the U.S. Commodities Future Trading Commission (“CFTC”), Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury) and in other countries. Other regulatory bodies are governmental or semi-governmental and have shown an interest in regulating or investigating companies engaged in the blockchain business (NASDAQ, NYSE, FINRA, state securities commissions).
 
Blockchain regulations are in a nascent state with agencies investigating businesses and their practices, gathering information, and generally trying to understand the risks and uncertainties in order to protect investors in these businesses. Regulations will certainly increase, in many cases, although it is presently not possible to know how they will increase, how regulations will apply to the Company’s businesses, or when they will be effective. Various bills have also been proposed in congress for adoption related to the Company’s business which may be adopted and have an impact on it. As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, the Company may become subject to new laws and further regulation by the SEC and other agencies, although the Company is not currently trading in digital assets and has no intention to trade in digital assets.
 
Employees
 
As of June 30, 2019, we had two full-time employees and three part-time employee. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
