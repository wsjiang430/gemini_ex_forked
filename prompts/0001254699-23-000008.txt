Overview
QVC, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (unless otherwise indicated or required by the context, the terms "we," "our," "us," the "Company," and "QVC" refer to QVC, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries) curates and sells a wide variety of consumer products via highly engaging, video-rich, interactive shopping experiences, distributed to approximately 217 million worldwide households each day through our broadcast networks. We also reach audiences through our websites (including QVC.com, HSN.com and others); virtual multichannel video programming distributors (including Hulu + Live TV, DirecTV Stream and YouTube TV); applications via streaming video; Facebook Live, Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire, Xfinity Flex and Samsung TV Plus; mobile applications; our social media pages and over-the-air broadcasters. We believe we are a global leader in video retailing, e-commerce, mobile commerce and social commerce, with operations based in the United States ("U.S."), Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom ("U.K."), and Italy.
The goal of QVC is to extend its leadership in video commerce, e-commerce, streaming commerce and social commerce by continuing to create the world’s most engaging shopping experiences, combining the best of retail, media and social, highly differentiated from traditional brick-and-mortar stores or transactional e-commerce. QVC provides customers with curated collections of unique products, made personal and relevant by the power of storytelling. We curate experiences, conversations and communities for millions of highly discerning shoppers, and we also reach large audiences, across our many platforms, for our thousands of brand partners.
I-2


We offer a wide assortment of high-quality merchandise and classify our products into six groups: home, beauty, apparel, jewelry, accessories and electronics. It is our product sourcing team's mission to research and curate compelling and differentiated products from manufacturers who have sufficient scale to meet anticipated demand. We offer many exclusive and proprietary products, leading national brands and limited distribution brands offering unique items. Many of our products are endorsed by celebrities, designers and other well-known personalities who often join our presenters on our live programming and provide lead-in publicity on their own social media pages, websites and other customer touchpoints. We believe that our ability to demonstrate product features and present “faces and places” differentiates and defines the QVC shopping experience. We closely monitor customer demand and our product mix to remain well-positioned and relevant in popular and growing retail segments, which we believe is a significant competitive advantage relative to competitors who operate brick-and-mortar stores.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 95% of QVC's worldwide shipped sales were from repeat and reactivated customers (i.e., customers who made a purchase from us during the prior twelve months and customers who previously made a purchase from us but not during the prior twelve months). In the same period, QVC attracted approximately 2.8 million new customers and the global e-commerce operation comprised $5.7 billion, or 57.2%, of QVC's consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.
We operate twelve distribution centers and five contact centers worldwide. In 2022, our work force consisted of approximately 20,800 employees who handled approximately 112 million customer calls, shipped approximately 216 million units globally and served approximately 13.2 million unique customers. We believe our long-term relationships with major U.S. television distributors, including cable operators (e.g., Comcast, Charter Communications and Cox), satellite television providers (e.g., DISH and DIRECTV) and telecommunications companies (e.g., Verizon and AT&T), provide us with broad distribution, favorable channel positioning and significant competitive advantages. We believe that our significant market share, brand awareness, outstanding customer service, repeat customer base, flexible payments options, international reach and scalable infrastructure distinguish us from our competitors.
History
QVC was founded on June 13, 1986 by Joseph Segel. Our first U.S. live broadcast took place at 7:30 PM ET on November 24 of that year, reaching 7.6 million homes. Initially broadcast live from 7:30 PM ET until midnight each weekday and all day Saturdays and Sundays, the channel extended its live U.S. programming to 24 hours per day in January 1987. QVC began its International operations in 1993.
In 1995, Comcast purchased a majority shareholding in QVC. In 2003, Comcast sold its majority share to Qurate Retail, Inc. ("Qurate Retail") (formerly known as Liberty Interactive Corporation).
HSN, Inc. ("HSN"), now a subsidiary of QVC, began broadcasting television home shopping programming from its studios in St. Petersburg, Florida in 1981 and, by 1985, was broadcasting its programming through a national network of cable and local television stations 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
On December 29, 2017, Qurate Retail completed the acquisition of the remaining 62% ownership interest of HSN it did not previously own in an all-stock transaction. On December 31, 2018, Qurate Retail transferred its 100% ownership interest in HSN to QVC through a transaction among entities under common control.
Reportable segments
QVC has two reportable segments: QxH and QVC-International. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. For financial information about our operating segments, please refer to note 16 of our accompanying consolidated financial statements, as well as to Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

QxH
QxH's programming is distributed in the U.S., 20 hours per day of live programming, 364 days per year, to approximately 93 million television households and is distributed to approximately 99% of households subscribing to services offered by television distributors. QxH's televised shopping programs, including live and recorded content, are broadcast across multiple channels nationally on a full time basis, including the main QVC and HSN channels as well as the additional channels of QVC2, QVC3 and HSN2. These additional channels offer viewers access to a broader range of QxH programming options as well as more relevant programming for viewers in different time zones. QxH also has over-the-air broadcasting in designated U.S. markets that can be accessed by any household with a digital antenna in such markets, regardless of whether it subscribes to a paid television service. This allows QxH to reach customers who previously did not have access to the program through other television platforms.
QxH's programming is also available through QVC.com and HSN.com (our "Websites") as well as virtual multichannel video programming distributors (including Hulu + Live TV, DirecTV Stream and YouTube TV); applications via streaming video; Facebook Live, Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire, Xfinity Flex and Samsung TV Plus; mobile applications; our social media pages and over-the-air broadcasters (collectively, our "Digital Platforms"). Our Digital Platforms enable consumers to purchase goods offered on our broadcast programming along with a wide assortment of products that are available only on our Websites. Our Websites and other Digital Platforms are natural extensions of our business model, allowing customers to engage in our shopping experience wherever they are, with live or on-demand content customized to the device they are using. In addition, our Websites and mobile applications allow shoppers to browse, research, compare and perform targeted searches for products, read customer reviews, control the order-entry process and conveniently access their account. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 85% of our new QxH customers made their first purchase through our digital platforms. QxH, including our Digital Platforms, contributed $7.4 billion, or 74%, of consolidated net revenue and $750 million of Adjusted OIBDA (defined in note 16 to the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements) for the year ended December 31, 2022.
The table below illustrates QxH's digital sales since 2020:
 | Years ended December 31,
(in millions) | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 
QxH digital platform revenue | $ | 4,450 | 5,003 | 5,089
Total QxH net revenue | 7,359 | 8,277 | 8,505
QxH digital platform % of total QxH net revenue | 60.5 | % | 60.4 | % | 59.8 | %

QVC-International
Our international business brings the QVC shopping experience to approximately 124 million households outside the U.S., primarily in Germany, Austria, Japan, the U.K., the Republic of Ireland, and Italy. Similar to QxH, our international business engages customers via multiple platforms, including broadcast networks, websites, mobile applications and social media pages. Our international product sourcing teams select products tailored to the interests of each local market. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our international operations, including our Digital platforms, generated $2.5 billion, or 26%, of consolidated net revenue and $358 million of Adjusted OIBDA (defined in note 16 to the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements).
The table below illustrates QVC-International's digital sales since 2020:
 | Years ended December 31,
(in millions) | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 
QVC - International digital platform revenue | $ | 1,202 | 1,458 | 1,359
Total QVC - International net revenue | 2,528 | 3,077 | 2,967
QVC - International digital platform % of total QVC - International net revenue | 47.5 | % | 47.4 | % | 45.8 | %

QVC-Japan. We own 60% of QVC-Japan through a venture with Mitsui & Co., LTD. QVC-Japan launched in April 2001 and currently broadcasts 19 hours of live programming each day and reaches approximately 29 million households. QVC-Japan also operates digital platforms including a website, mobile applications and social media pages. In 2014, QVC-Japan launched Q-plus, which consists of infomercial programming distributed by purchasing available airtime on certain channels. On December 1, 2018, QVC-Japan launched 4K high dynamic range broadcasting ("HDR"), making QVC-Japan the first network in Japan to broadcast native, full-scale 4K HDR programming 24 hours a day. 
I-4


QVC-Germany. QVC-Germany went on air in December 1996 and currently broadcasts 17 hours of live programming each day and reaches approximately 42 million households that are located in both Germany and Austria. Beyond the main channel, QVC-Germany also broadcasts shows on two additional channels, QVC ZWEI and QVC Style, which provide a broader range of programming options. QVC-Germany also operates digital platforms including a website, a mobile application, smart TV applications, and social media pages. 
QVC-U.K. QVC-U.K. went on air in October 1993 and currently broadcasts 16 hours of live programming each day and reaches approximately 28 million households that are located in both the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland. Beyond the main channel, QVC-U.K. also broadcasts shows on four additional channels, QVC Beauty, QVC Extra, QVC Style, and QVC Plus, which provides a broader range of programming options, along with digital platforms including a website, mobile applications and social media pages. 
QVC-Italy. QVC-Italy went on air in October 2010 and currently reaches approximately 25 million households. QVC-Italy broadcasts live for 17 hours each day on satellite and digital terrestrial television. QVC-Italy also operates digital platforms including a website, a mobile application and social media pages.
China Joint Venture. Prior to September 2021, the Company had a television shopping channel and e-commerce business joint venture with CNR Media Group, a limited liability company owned by China National Radio ("CNR"). The joint venture, CNR Home Shopping Co., Ltd. ("CNRS"), was owned 49% by QVC and 51% by CNR through subsidiaries of each company. The CNRS joint venture was accounted for as an equity method investment recorded as equity in losses of investee in our consolidated statements of operations. QVC sold its interest in CNRS during the year-ended December 31, 2021.
Merchandise
We believe that our ability to combine product and programming helps us create competitive advantages over traditional brick-and-mortar and Internet retailers. We seek to offer our customers an assortment of compelling, high-quality products. In the U.S., the QVC and HSN brands present on average 664 products and 537 products, respectively, every week on our live programming, approximately 38.1% and 23.1%, respectively, of which have not been presented previously to our television audience. We offer customers high-quality and brand name products, presented in a creative, informative, entertaining and engaging style. We provide a differentiated shopping experience by offering customers the opportunity to experience not only the product being sold, but also the people and places behind that product, thereby enhancing their overall shopping experience.
Our global merchandise mix features: (i) home, (ii) apparel, (iii) beauty, (iv) accessories, (v) electronics and (vi) jewelry. Many of our brands are exclusive, while others are created by well-known designers. Our global sales mix is provided in the table below:
 | Years ended December 31,
Product category | 2022 | 2021 | 2020
Home | 40 | % | 40 | % | 42 | %
Apparel | 18 | % | 16 | % | 14 | %
Beauty | 17 | % | 18 | % | 18 | %
Accessories | 11 | % | 11 | % | 11 | %
Electronics | 9 | % | 10 | % | 10 | %
Jewelry | 5 | % | 5 | % | 5 | %
Total | 100 | % | 100 | % | 100 | %

Unlike traditional brick-and-mortar retailers with inventories across a network of stores, we are able to quickly adapt our offerings in direct response to changes in our customer's purchasing patterns. We utilize a test and re-order model to determine initial customer demand. Through constant monitoring, we aim to manage our product offerings to maximize net revenue and fulfill current demand in large growth segments where we can gain a greater share of our customers' purchases. Our merchandising team is dedicated to continually researching, pursuing and launching new products and brands. With a mandate to deliver hard-to-find value, our merchants find and curate collections of high quality goods from manufacturers with the scale to offer sufficient supply to our existing and future customers. We maintain strong relationships with our vendors, which are attracted by the showcasing and story-telling elements of our programming, and the volume of sales during featured presentations. 
I-5


We purchase, or obtain on consignment, products from U.S. and foreign manufacturers and wholesalers, often on favorable terms based upon the volume of the transactions. We have attracted some of the world’s most respected consumer brands as well as celebrities, entrepreneurs and designers to promote these brands. Brand leaders such as HP, Apple, Barefoot Dreams, Dyson, Skechers and Philosophy reach a broad audience while product representatives share the stories behind these brands. We have agreements with celebrities, entrepreneurs and designers such as Isaac Mizrahi, Curtis Stone and Giuliana Rancic enabling us to provide entertaining and engaging programming that develops a lifestyle bond with our customers. These celebrity personalities and product representatives often provide pre-appearance publicity for their QVC products on their own social media pages and broadcast shows, enhancing demand during their QVC appearances. We present and promote across our networks, websites, mobile applications and social platforms, allowing shoppers to engage with us on multiple platforms and devices. 
We do not depend on any single supplier or designer for a significant portion of our inventory purchases.
Distribution
QVC distributes its programmings via satellite and optical fiber, to cable television and direct-to-home satellite system operators for retransmission to its subscribers in the U.S., Germany, Japan, the U.K., Italy and neighboring countries. The Company also transmits its programmings over digital terrestrial broadcast television to viewers throughout Italy, Germany, and the U.K. and to viewers in certain geographic regions in the U.S. In the U.S., the Company uplinks its digital programming transmissions using a third party service or internal resources. The transmissions are uplinked to protected, non-preemptible transponders on U.S. satellites. "Protected" status means that, in the event of a transponder failure, QVC's signal will be transferred to a spare transponder or, if none is available, to a preemptible transponder located on the same satellite or, in certain cases, to a transponder on another satellite owned by the same service provider if one is available at the time of the failure. "Non-preemptible" status means that, in the event of a transponder failure, QVC's transponders cannot be preempted in favor of a user of a failed transponder, even another user with "protected status." The Company's international business units each obtain uplinking services from third parties and transmit their programming to non-preemptible transponders on international satellites and terrestrial transmitters. QVC's transponder service agreements for the Company's U.S. transponders expire at the earlier of the end of the lives of the satellites or the service agreements. The service agreements for QxH expire between 2023 and 2025. The service agreements for QVC-International transponders and terrestrial transmitters expire between 2023 and 2029.
We continually seek to expand and enhance our broadcast and e-commerce platforms, as well as to further our international operations and multimedia capabilities. In addition to our websites and mobile applications, we continue to adapt to emerging technologies to offer elements of our programming via new technologies. To reach consumers who use online sources for viewing content, our programming is being offered through virtual multichannel video providers (including Hulu + Live TV, DirecTV Stream and YouTube TV), online video distributors and programming networks that provide our content directly to consumers over the internet rather than through traditional television services (including Facebook Live, Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire, Xfinity Flex and Samsung TV Plus). In 2022 we launched on The Roku Channel, a leader in free, ad-supported streaming TV. 
Affiliation agreements
QVC enters into long-term affiliation agreements with certain of our television distributors who downlink our programming and distribute the programming to their customers. Our affiliation agreements with QVC distributors have termination dates ranging from 2023 to 2026. Our ability to continue to sell products to our customers is dependent on our ability to maintain and renew these affiliation agreements in the future. Although we are typically successful in obtaining and renewing these agreements, we do not have distribution agreements with some of the distributors that carry our programming. We are currently providing programming without affiliation agreements to distributors representing approximately 7% of our QVC channel distribution and 1% of our HSN channel distribution. Some of our international programming may continue to be carried by distributors after the expiration dates on our affiliation agreements with them have passed.
In return for carrying our signals, most programming distributors for our U.S. distribution receive an allocated portion, based upon market share, of up to 5% of the net sales of merchandise sold via the television programs and from certain Internet sales to customers located in the programming distributor's service areas. In some cases, we also pay programming distributors additional compensation in the form of incentives in exchange for their commitments to maintain specific channel positioning benchmarks. QVC-International programming distributors predominantly receive an agreed-upon annual fee, a monthly or yearly fee per subscriber regardless of the net sales, a variable percentage of net sales or some combination of the above arrangements.
I-6


In addition to sales-based commissions or per-subscriber fees, QVC also makes payments to distributors primarily in the U.S. for carriage and to secure channel positioning within a broadcast area or within the general entertainment area on the distributor's channel line-up. We believe that a portion of our sales is attributable to purchases resulting from channel "surfing" and that a channel position near broadcast networks and more popular cable networks increases the likelihood of such purchases. As technology evolves, we will continue to monitor optimal channel placement and attempt to negotiate agreements with our distributors to maximize the viewership of our television programming.
Demographics of customers
We enjoy a very loyal customer base, as demonstrated by the fact that for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, approximately 89% of our shipped sales came from repeat customers (i.e., customers who made a purchase from us during the prior twelve months), who spent an average of $1,324 each during this period. An additional 5% of shipped sales in that period came from new customers and the remaining 6% of shipped sales came from reactivated customers (i.e., customers who previously made a purchase from us, but not during the prior twelve months). 
On a trailing twelve month basis, total consolidated customers were approximately 13.2 million which includes 8.9 million QxH customers and 4.3 million QVC-International customers. We believe our core customer base represents an attractive demographic target market. Based on internal customer data for QxH, approximately 39% of our 8.9 million customers for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 were women between the ages of 35 and 64.
We do not depend on any single customer for a significant portion of our revenue. 
Order taking and fulfillment
We take a majority of our orders via our websites and via mobile applications on iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Android and other devices. QxH and QVC-International customers placed approximately 42% and 35%, respectively, of all orders directly through their mobile devices in 2022.
We primarily utilize home based customer service agents to handle calls, e-mail contacts and social contacts, allowing staffing flexibility for peak volume hours. In addition, we utilize computerized interactive voice response order systems for telephonic orders, which handle approximately 24% of all orders taken on a worldwide basis. QxH has eight distribution centers and QVC-International has four distribution centers. Our distribution centers and drop ship partners have shipped on average 413,000 units per day at QxH and 178,000 units per day for QVC-International during 2022.
QVC has built a scalable operating infrastructure focused on sustaining efficient, flexible and cost-effective sale and distribution of our products. Since our physical store locations are minimal, we require lower inventory levels and capital expenditures compared to traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Further, since we have no set “floor plan” and can closely manage inventory levels at our centralized warehouses, we believe we have the flexibility to analyze and react quickly to changing trends and demand by shifting programming time and product mix. Our cost structure is highly variable, which we believe allows us to consistently achieve attractive margins relative to brick-and-mortar retailers.
Third party carriers transport our packages from our distribution centers to our customers. In each market where we operate, we have negotiated long-term contracts with shipping companies, which in certain circumstances provide for favorable shipping rates.
Competition
We operate in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive retail business environment. We have numerous and varied competitors at the national and local levels, ranging from large department stores to specialty shops, e-commerce retailers, direct marketing retailers, wholesale clubs, discount retailers, infomercial retailers, and mail-order and catalog companies. Some of our competitors, such as Amazon and Walmart, have a significantly greater web-presence. We believe that the principal competitive factors for our web-commerce operations are high-quality products, brand recognition, selection, value, convenience, price, website performance, customer service and accuracy of order shipment.
I-7


We believe that QxH is a leader in video shopping, e-commerce, mobile commerce and social commerce by curating quality products at outstanding values, providing exceptional customer service, establishing favorable channel positioning and multiple touchpoints across digital platforms and generating repeat business from our core customer base and that it also compares favorably in terms of sales to general, non-video based retailers due to our extensive customer reach and efficient cost structure. QxH's closest video shopping competitor is ShopHQ and our international operations face similar competition in their respective markets, such as Jupiter Shop Channel in Japan, HSE in Germany and Austria, GM24 in Italy, and Ideal World in the U.K. 
We also compete for access to customers and audience share with other providers of broadcast, digital and hard copy entertainment and content. The price and availability of other programming and the conversion to digital programming platforms may unfavorably affect the placement of our programming in the channel line-ups of our distributors, and may affect our ability to obtain distribution agreements with small cable distributors. Competition from other programming also affects the compensation that must be paid to distributors for carriage. Principal competitive factors for us include (i) value, quality and selection of merchandise; (ii) customer experience, including customer service and speed, cost and reliability of fulfillment and delivery services, and (iii) convenience and accessibility of sales channels.
Human Capital
Headcount. QVC employed approximately 20,800 full-time and part-time employees as of December 31, 2022, which includes 13,600 employees at QxH and 7,200 employees at QVC-International. Employment levels fluctuate due to seasonal factors affecting our business. Additionally, we utilize independent contractors and temporary staffing personnel to supplement our workforce, particularly on a seasonal basis. We consider our employee relations to be good and a key factor in our workforce strategy.
Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion ("DE&I"). We remain committed to fostering an inclusive culture that ensures fairness and a sense of belonging for every team member, business partner and customer experience we offer by leveraging diversity in all its forms to deliver on our promise to continuously exceed expectations. Our DE&I commitments focus on the following areas: leadership representation, leadership accountability, education and awareness, culture, consumers & marketplace, community impact and transparency. We serve a broad and diverse range of customers around the world and we strive to understand the lives they lead in order to deliver authentic customer experiences with meaningful curated products. For this reason we embrace the benefits that the diverse backgrounds, perspectives and experiences of our team members bring to our culture and the decisions we make. We aim to ensure that we consistently apply a lens of inclusion and equity in our processes and decisions relating to our team members, business partners, products, and customer experiences. We are taking steps to help team members discover new perspectives, build empathy, have critical conversations about topics such as race, microaggressions and allyship, and support each other. We have expanded Team Member Resource Groups to promote team member connections, career development, community impact and consumer and marketplace growth. We are delivering our DE&I training to all team members via online modules, videos, e-learning, and in-person facilitated experiences. We are also continuing our efforts to attract and grow diverse talent and suppliers, offer inclusive product assortments, and ensure broad representation in our marketing, digital, and on-air activities.
Team Member Engagement and Enablement. To improve team member engagement and enablement, we conduct an annual team member engagement survey and various pulse surveys throughout the year on topics such as company direction, leadership, culture, performance and rewards, and change management. The results of these surveys are used by management to improve the overall team member experience and retention, as well as help to inform our approach to company programs and practices. For example, based in part on feedback from team members regarding work from home arrangements instituted in response to the outbreak of COVID-19, in 2022 we introduced a new flexible distributed workforce model which allows some of our team members to have the option to work from home most of the time based on a schedule approved by our team members’ respective management team.
Health and Safety. We are committed to maintaining a safe and secure work environment and have specific safety programs and protocols in place to protect our team members. This includes administering a comprehensive occupational injury- and illness-prevention program and training for team members. In addition to offering a variety of comprehensive health benefits plans, we also offer our team members a variety of mental, emotional, and physical wellness resources, among a number of other initiatives, such as greater access to telemedicine and home care help. We also continue to monitor governmental response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and where applicable, continue to comply with country, state and local restrictions related to addressing COVID-19 risks.

Government regulation
The manner in which we sell and promote merchandise and related claims and representations made in connection with these efforts is regulated by federal and state law. Some examples of regulatory agencies and regulations that affect the manner in which we sell and promote merchandise include the following:

•Import and export laws, including U.S. economic sanction and embargo regulations, U.S. homeland security laws and regulations and other laws such as the U.S. anti-boycott law and U.S. export controls regulations may limit foreign sales.
•Comparable regulatory agencies and regulations in countries in which we have our non-U.S. operations may be applicable.
In addition, the FCC regulates the cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite ("DBS") distributors and other multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs") that distribute the Company’s services, has adopted various requirements related to the Company’s programming, and also licenses radio transmission facilities that the Company uses in connection with its business, such as satellite uplink facilities and internal private radio systems.
As a result of an interest in various cable operators attributed to Qurate Retail, the Company may be deemed to be a satellite cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable interest for purposes of various FCC rules regarding the distribution of video programming to MVPDs. These include, for example, the FCC’s program access rules, which, in general, prohibit various unfair practices involving the distribution of video programming to MVPDs; and its program carriage rules, which, among other things, prohibit cable operators from favoring affiliated programmers so as to restrain unreasonably the ability of unaffiliated programmers to compete. The FCC program access and program carriage rules also make provision for enforcement of alleged violations through complaint proceedings initiated by aggrieved entities. The Company also may be subject to program access rules as a result of an FCC condition adopted in connection with its 2008 approval of a transaction involving a predecessor of Qurate Retail and News Corp. Previously adopted FCC channel occupancy rules, which limited carriage by a cable operator of national programming services in which that operator holds an attributable interest, were vacated and remanded by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2001. The FCC issued further notices of proposed rulemaking in 2001 and 2005 to consider channel occupancy limitations, but has not adopted any rules. 
In 2000, we became subject to a consent decree issued by the FTC barring us from making certain deceptive claims for dietary supplements and specified products related to the common cold, pneumonia, hay fever and allergies. We also became subject to an expanded consent decree issued by the FTC in 2009 that terminates on the later of May 26, 2029, or 20 years from the most recent date that the U.S. or the FTC files a complaint in federal court alleging any violation thereunder. Pursuant to this expanded consent decree, we are prohibited from making certain claims about specified weight-loss, dietary supplement and anti-cellulite products unless we have competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate such claims. Violation of the QVC consent decree may result in the imposition of significant civil penalties for non-compliance and related redress to consumers and/or the issuance of an injunction enjoining us from engaging in prohibited activities.

Congress enacted the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation ("CALM") Act in 2010. The CALM Act directs the FCC to incorporate into its rules and make mandatory a technical standard that is designed to prevent digital television commercial advertisements from being transmitted at louder volumes than the program material they accompany. Although the FCC's CALM Act regulations place direct compliance responsibility on broadcasters and MVPDs, the FCC adopted a "safe harbor" compliance approach applicable to commercials embedded in programming provided by programmers, such as the Company. Under the FCC's safe harbor approach, broadcasters and MVPDs may meet their CALM Act compliance obligations through reliance on programmer-provided CALM Act compliance certifications that are made "widely available" to broadcasters and MVPDs through a website or other means. The Company has determined that its programming is CALM Act compliant, and in response to requests from its distributors, and in order to allow its distributors to meet the FCC's safe harbor, the Company has posted a CALM Act compliance certification to a website that is available to its distributors.
FCC rules adopted pursuant to the Telecommunications Act of 1996 generally require closed captioning of the Company’s televised programming distributed on broadcast television stations, cable television systems, DBS and other MVPDs, with only limited exemptions. Regulations adopted by the FCC pursuant to the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 imposed captioning requirements on various types of programming distributed via Internet protocol ("IP") that was previously televised with captions. The Company also is subject to the IP-captioning rules as a Video Programming Owner and as a Video Programming Distributor that distributes covered programming on its website and via mobile and video streaming platforms. 
The FCC’s closed captioning rules applicable to televised programming and programming distributed by IP initially placed closed captioning compliance obligations directly on the Company’s distributors. Amendments to those rules adopted by the FCC in 2016 extend direct compliance responsibility, jointly with distributors, to video programmers such as the Company, impose certain registration and certification requirements on the Company, and subject the Company to captioning complaint procedures. The registration and certification requirements of these amended rules have not yet become effective. As a result of the foregoing changes and rules involving captioning of IP-delivered programming and captioning quality standards, QVC may incur additional costs and compliance obligations related to closed captioning of its programming.
We market and provide a broad range of merchandise through our broadcast networks, websites, mobile applications and social media pages. As a result, we are subject to a wide variety of statutes, rules, regulations, policies and procedures in various jurisdictions that are subject to change at any time, including laws regarding consumer protection, privacy, the regulation of retailers generally, the importation, sale and promotion of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities, as well as laws and regulations applicable to the Internet and businesses engaged in online commerce, such as those regulating the sending of unsolicited, commercial electronic mail and texts.
For example, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act prohibits web sites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without parental consent and imposes a number of operational requirements. Certain email activities are subject to the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, commonly known as the CAN-SPAM Act. The CAN-SPAM Act regulates the sending of unsolicited commercial email by requiring the email sender, among other things, to comply with specific disclosure requirements and to provide an "opt-out" mechanism for recipients. Both of these laws include statutory penalties for non-compliance. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act limits, but does not eliminate, liability for listing or linking to third party websites that may include content that infringes on copyrights or other rights so long as our Internet businesses comply with the statutory requirements. Various states also have adopted laws regulating certain aspects of Internet communications. Federal legislation enacted in 2016 permanently extended the moratorium on state and local taxes on Internet access.
Our online commerce businesses are subject to domestic and foreign laws governing the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally-identifiable information about their users. The enactment, interpretation and application of user data protection laws are in a state of flux, and the interpretation and application of such laws may vary from country to country. For example, the European Union’s ("E.U.") General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which established new data laws that give customers additional rights and impose additional restrictions and penalties on companies for illegal collection and misuse of personal information, took effect in May 2018. Further, in 2015, the Court of Justice of the E.U. invalidated the "Safe Harbor Framework," which had allowed companies to collect and process personal data in E.U. nations for use in the U.S. The E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, which replaced the Safe Harbor Framework, and became fully operational in 2016, provided a mechanism to comply with data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the E.U. to the U.S. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the E.U. invalidated the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, and imposed new obligations on the use of Standard Contractual Clauses ("SCCs") - another key mechanism to allow data transfers between the U.S. and the E.U.. The European Commission adopted revised SCCs on June 4, 2021. In March 2022, the U.S. and the European Commission announced a new Transatlantic Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) to replace the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield. On December 13, 2022, the European Commission issued an adequacy decision initiating the formal adoption process

for the DPF. On February 10, 2021, the Council of the E.U, adopted final regulations regarding privacy and electronic communications that would complement the GDPR, including additional regulation of the Internet tracking tools known as “cookies.” The final regulations are subject to review by the European Parliament and European Commission, and may be enacted in 2023. Following the “Brexit” withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U., on June 28, 2021, the European Commission determined that the U.K.’s data protection laws essentially are equivalent to data protection laws in the European Economic Area. Finally, countries in other regions, most notably Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America, are increasingly implementing new privacy regulations, resulting in additional compliance burdens and uncertainty as to how some of these laws will be enforced.
In the U.S., Congress may consider legislation that would require organizations that suffer a breach of security related to personal information to notify owners of such information. Many states have adopted laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach affecting personal data, such as California's Information Practices Act. California also has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which, among other things, allows California consumers to request that certain companies disclose the types of personal information collected by such companies. The CCPA took effect on January 1, 2020. The California Attorney General has issued implementation regulations and guidance regarding the law. In November 2020, California voters approved the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), which amends and extends the CCPA and establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce consumer privacy laws. Most of the CPRA’s provisions became effective on January 1, 2023. In addition, Virginia enacted the Consumer Data Protection Act in March 2021, which regulates the handling of personal data and became effective on January 1, 2023, and Colorado enacted a personal data protection law in July 2021, the Colorado Privacy Act, which takes effect on July 1, 2023. Utah and Connecticut also have enacted consumer privacy statutes, and other states likely will consider similar legislation in 2023. Complying with these different national and state privacy requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs. In addition, we generally have and post on our websites privacy policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of user data. A failure to comply with such posted privacy policies or with the regulatory requirements of federal, state, or foreign privacy laws could result in proceedings or actions by governmental agencies or others (such as class action litigation) which could adversely affect our business.
Our business is also dependent upon our continued ability to transmit our programming to television distributors from our third party FCC-licensed satellite uplink facilities, which are subject to FCC compliance in the U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements in our international operations.
For information regarding regulations related to U.S. trade policy with China, see the risk factor "Significant developments stemming from U.S. and international trade policy with China, including in response to forced labor and human rights abuses in China may adversely impact our business and operating results" in Item 1A., "Risk Factors."
Intellectual property
We regard our tradenames, service marks, patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as critical to our success. We rely on a combination of tradename, patent and copyright law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to protect these proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of tradenames, service marks, patents, copyrights and domain names through U.S. and foreign governmental authorities and vigorously protect our proprietary rights against infringement.
In the U.S., we have registered tradenames and service marks including, but not limited to our brand names and logo, "QVC," "Quality Value Convenience," the "Q Logo," and "Q" and trademarks for our proprietary products sold such as "Arte D’Oro," "Cook’s Essentials," "Denim & Co.," "Diamonique," "Nature's Code," "Northern Nights" and "Ultrafine Silver." Similarly, foreign registrations have been obtained for many tradenames and service marks for our brand names, logo and propriety products including, but not limited to, "QVC," the "Q Logo," "Q," "Cook’s Essentials," "Denim & Co.," "Diamonique" and "Northern Nights." 
HSN has numerous tradename registrations or pending applications in the U.S. which help to expand HSN’s brand awareness. These registrations and applications include the “HSN” brand name and the “HSN logo” as well as registrations for HSN’s propriety products and services, including, but not limited to, “HSN Shop By Remote,” “Technibond,” and “Concierge Collection.” 
I-11


We consider the "QVC" and "HSN" names the most significant tradenames and service marks held by us because of their impact on market awareness across all of our geographic markets and on customers’ identification with us. As with all U.S. tradenames or service marks, our tradename and service mark registrations in the U.S. are for a ten year period and are renewable every ten years, prior to their respective expirations, as long as the tradenames or service marks are used in the regular course of trade.
Qurate Retail relationship and related party transactions
The Company is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Qurate Retail (Nasdaq: QRTEA, QRTEB and QRTEP), which owns interests in a broad range of digital commerce businesses, including Qurate Retail's other wholly-owned subsidiaries Zulily, LLC ("Zulily") and Cornerstone Brands, Inc. ("CBI"), as well as other minority investments. QVC is part of Qurate Retail Group ("QRG"), formerly QVC Group, a portfolio of brands including QVC, HSN, Zulily and CBI.
QVC engages with Zulily, which has been a wholly-owned subsidiary of Qurate Retail since October 2015. Zulily is not part of the results of operations or financial position of QVC presented in this Form 10-K. QVC and Zulily engaged in multiple transactions relating to sales, sourcing of merchandise, marketing initiatives, and business advisory services. Refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
QVC engages with CBI, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Qurate Retail and prior to the common control transaction between QVC and Qurate Retail, was included as part of HSN. CBI is not part of the results of operations or financial position of QVC presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2022, QVC and CBI engaged in multiple transactions relating to sourcing of merchandise, personnel and business advisory services. Refer to note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details. 
On December 30, 2020, the Company and Liberty Interactive LLC ("LIC") completed an internal realignment of the Company's global finance structure that resulted in a common control transaction with Qurate Retail. As part of this realignment and upon entering into a payment agreement, QVC Global Corporate Holdings, LLC ("QVC Global"), a subsidiary of the Company, became the primary co-obligor on LIC’s 3.5% Senior Exchangeable Debentures Due 2031 (the “MSI Exchangeables”), which allowed the MSI Exchangeables to be serviced directly by cash generated from the Company’s foreign operations (see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Concurrently, LIC issued a promissory note to the Company with an initial face amount of $1.8 billion, a stated interest rate of 0.48%, payable annually, and a maturity of December 29, 2029. QVC recorded $9 million of related party interest income for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, included in interest expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations. LIC also repaid $85 million of the note receivable to QVC during the year ended December 31, 2021.
On October 27, 2021, a notice was issued to all holders to redeem any and all outstanding MSI Exchangeables on December 13, 2021. Bondholders had until the close of business on December 10, 2021 to exchange their bonds. During the fourth quarter of 2021, QVC Global delivered MSI shares, which were acquired pursuant to a forward purchase contract, to holders of the MSI Exchangeables with a fair value of approximately $573 million to settle the exchanges of the MSI Exchangeables. For holders who did not participate in the exchange, their bonds were redeemed on December 13, 2021 at adjusted principal, plus accrued interest and dividend pass-thru for a total cash payment of approximately $1 million. No MSI Exchangeables were outstanding as of December 31, 2021. As a result of the exchange and the redemption, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations of $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

On October 27, 2021, QVC amended and restated its senior secured credit facility (the "Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement") which is a multi-currency facility that provides for a $3.25 billion revolving credit facility (see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). The Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement may be borrowed on by QVC, Zulily, CBI, and QVC Global (collectively, the “Borrowers”). Under the terms of the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Borrowers are jointly and severally liable for all outstanding borrowings. In accordance with the accounting guidance for obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements, QVC will record a liability for amounts it has borrowed under the credit facility plus any additional amount it expects to repay on behalf of Zulily and CBI. As of December 31, 2021, there was $151 million borrowed by Zulily on the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. In December 2021, QVC determined it was necessary to record a liability for the full amount of Zulily's outstanding borrowings. As part of a common control transaction with Qurate Retail in December 2021 (see note 2(s) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), QVC recorded a liability for $151 million of Zulily's outstanding borrowings. During the year-ended December 31, 2022, Qurate Retail made a capital contribution to Zulily to enable Zulily to repay its outstanding borrowings and as a result there were no borrowings by Zulily on the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, there was $18 million borrowed by CBI on the senior secured credit facility, none of which the Company expects to repay on behalf of CBI. There were no borrowings by CBI on the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2021.
On June 27, 2022, Qurate Retail announced a five-point turnaround plan designed to stabilize and differentiate its core HSN and QVC- U.S. brands and expand the company's leadership in video streaming commerce (“Project Athens”). Project Athens main initiatives include: (i) improve customer experience and grow relationships; (ii) rigorously execute core processes; (iii) lower cost to serve; (iv) optimize the brand portfolio; and (v) build new high growth businesses anchored in strength. During 2022 QVC commenced the first phase of Project Athens including actions to reduce inventory and a planned workforce reduction. These initiatives are consistent with QVC’s strategy to operate more efficiently as it implements its turnaround plan. QVC recorded restructuring charges of $24 million in Restructuring and fire related costs, net of (recoveries) in the consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2022, related to workforce reduction.
We are a "close corporation" under Delaware law and, as such, our stockholder, rather than a board of directors, manages our business. Since our stockholder is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Qurate Retail, certain aspects of our management, including the approval of significant corporate transactions such as a change of control, are controlled by Qurate Retail, rather than an independent governing body. Our Chief Executive Officer and President, David L. Rawlinson II, also became president and chief executive officer of Qurate Retail during 2021.
Qurate Retail's interests may not coincide with our interests or yours and Qurate Retail may cause us to enter into transactions or agreements with related parties or approve corporate actions that could involve conflicts of interest. For example, Qurate Retail's dependence on our cash flow for servicing its debt and for other purposes is likely to result in our payment of large dividends to Qurate Retail, which may increase our leverage and decrease our liquidity. We paid $1,270 million, $963 million, and $1,184 million of dividends to Qurate Retail during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. See also Item 1A. "Risk Factors."
