ITEM 1. BUSINESS
We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company striving to transform patient lives through the development of innovative and differentiated prescription therapeutics. Our pipeline aims to disrupt existing treatment paradigms and features several new chemical entities that inhibit novel targets with first-in-class potential for autoimmune, inflammatory, and other debilitating diseases. Our executive management team and board of directors (our “Board”) have a proven track record of leadership across early-stage research, product development, and global commercialization, having served in leadership roles at large global pharmaceutical and biotech companies that successfully developed and/or launched first-in-class products, some of which have achieved iconic status, including Cialis®, Taltz®, Gemzar®, Prozac®, Cymbalta®, Juvederm®, Pluvicto®, and sofpironium bromide. Our strategy is to align this experience and clear vision to explore beyond the limitations of current therapies by identifying, pursuing, and developing next-generation therapeutics that can be groundbreaking in their ability to help millions of people struggling with autoimmune, inflammatory, and other debilitating diseases. 
On September 7, 2022, we changed our corporate entity name from Brickell Biotech, Inc. to Fresh Tracks Therapeutics, Inc. and updated our logo, website, and branding elements to reflect the new name. We also updated our product candidate names accordingly, for instance BBI-02 became FRTX-02 and BBI-10 became FRTX-10.
Exploration of Strategic Options
Our Board and executive management team are conducting a comprehensive process to explore and evaluate strategic options to progress the development of our novel pipeline of potential treatments for autoimmune, inflammatory, and other diseases. Potential strategic options to be explored or evaluated as part of this process may include, but are not limited to, a financing, sale or licensing of assets, acquisition, merger, business combination, and/or other strategic transaction or series of related transactions involving our Company. MTS Health Partners, LP has been retained as our exclusive financial advisor to assist in this review process.

Research & Development Programs
FRTX-02: A Potential First-in-Class Oral DYRK1A Inhibitor for the Treatment of Autoimmune and Inflammatory Diseases 
FRTX-02, a novel, potent, highly selective, and orally bioavailable potential first-in-class, small molecule DYRK1A inhibitor that aims to restore immune balance in patients whose immune systems have become dysregulated. We believe FRTX-02 has the potential to be a first-in-class therapy for the treatment of a wide array of debilitating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
FRTX-02 is our lead development-stage program and has demonstrated promising results in various preclinical models, including of atopic dermatitis (“AD”) and rheumatoid arthritis. In these models, FRTX-02 showed encouraging decreases in disease severity and reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to current standard-of-care agents, such as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and anti-tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”) biologics. Notably, many current therapies for autoimmune disorders are broadly immunosuppressive, which may lead to severe side effects, such as increased infection risk. Preclinical data have shown FRTX-02 to drive regulatory T-cell differentiation while dampening pro-inflammatory TH17 cells and MyD88/IRAK4-related signaling pathways. Regulatory T-cells serve to maintain tolerance and keep the autoreactive, pro-inflammatory T-cells in check, thus inhibiting autoimmune disease and limiting chronic inflammation. The myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (“MyD88”) protein is normally spliced into a long form and a short form. The long form of MyD88 drives inflammation via pathways related to IRAK4, a protein kinase involved in signaling immune responses from toll-like receptors, while the short form of MyD88 limits IRAK4 phosphorylation and its respective downstream signaling pathway. DYRK1A inhibition shifts the balance to produce more MyD88 short form, which leads to deactivation of the downstream release of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines. Based on current understanding, this inhibition of the release of excess cytokines can be achieved by re-establishing the role of MyD88 short form as a negative regulator of this pathway. Unlike many existing therapies, as well as those currently being investigated, FRTX-02 may have the ability to target both the adaptive and innate immune imbalance simultaneously, potentially resulting in, or substantially achieving, restoration of immune homeostasis that, if proven, would represent a paradigm shift in the treatment of certain autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
In May 2022, we initiated a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial for FRTX-02 (“FRTX-02-101”) in Canada, which marks the first time an oral DYRK1A inhibitor intended for patients with autoimmune diseases has been administered in humans. FRTX-02-101 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of FRTX-02 capsules in both healthy subjects and patients with AD. Parts 1A and 1B of the Phase 1 clinical trial were completed in the fourth quarter of 2022, and in March 2023, we reported positive topline results described in greater detail below. Part 2 of the study is planned to compare once-daily oral doses of FRTX-02 to placebo in subjects with moderate-to-severe AD and include an exploratory evaluation of efficacy. Part 2 is expected to enroll approximately 40 patients at up to 12 study centers.
FRTX-02 is covered by a composition of matter patent issued in the U.S., Japan, China, and other key countries through at least 2038, subject to patent term extensions and adjustments that may be available depending on how this early-stage asset is developed, as well as a pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) application, and other foreign and U.S. applications for FRTX-02, as of the date of this Annual Report. 
FRTX-10: A covalent Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) inhibitor candidate for the Potential Treatment of Autoimmune, Inflammatory, and Rare Genetic Diseases
In February 2022, we acquired exclusive, worldwide rights to research, develop, and commercialize a portfolio of novel, preclinical-stage oral Stimulator of Interferon Genes (“STING”) inhibitors. STING is a well-known mediator of innate immune responses. Excessive signaling through STING is linked to numerous high unmet-
need diseases, ranging from autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, to interferonopathies, which are a set of rare genetic conditions characterized by interferon overproduction and could have orphan drug potential.
STING is a key component of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (“cGAS”)-STING pathway, which plays an important role in the activation of innate immunity. cGAS acts as a DNA sensor, detecting DNA from sources such as invading bacteria, viruses, and cellular debris that can arise from aging and tissue damage. Upon DNA binding, cGAS produces the secondary messenger molecule cyclic GMP-AMP (“cGAMP”), which binds to STING. STING then undergoes the post-translational modification called palmitoylation, a step essential to the activation of STING. Activated STING then in turn activates the recruitment of kinases that phosphorylate IRF3 and IκBα. Phosphorylated IRF3 leads to activation of the type I interferon response, while phosphorylated IκBα activates NFκB and increases the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNFα, resulting in inflammation. While the innate immune response is an important defense mechanism, a dysregulated type I interferon response and overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines also represents a driving cause of multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. As such, targeting the cGAS-STING pathway through STING inhibition may be a novel approach to treating these diseases. 
FRTX-10, our lead early-stage STING inhibitor candidate, is a novel, potent, and orally bioavailable covalent STING inhibitor that specifically targets the palmitoylation site of STING. This allows it to inhibit both wild-type STING and gain-of-function mutants without competing with cGAMP binding, thus deactivating downstream signaling through IRF3 and IκBα and ultimately suppressing inflammation. FRTX-10 has exhibited strong proof-of mechanism and a promising profile in initial pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and safety pharmacology studies. In addition, in vitro studies show that FRTX-10 more potently blocks the STING pathway compared to other known STING palmitoylation inhibitors, and that mice treated with FRTX-10 in vivo demonstrate significant decreases in production of key pro-inflammatory cytokines following stimulation of STING.
For FRTX-10, as of the date of this Annual Report, we currently have two pending PCT applications and pending applications in the U.S., Japan, Europe, and other key countries. We possess an exclusive license directed to a library of compounds targeting/inhibiting STING, pharmaceutical compositions containing the same, and methods of their use, which are being evaluated. 
Next-Generation Kinase Inhibitors: A Cutting-Edge Platform with the Potential to Produce Treatments for Autoimmune, Inflammatory, and Other Debilitating Diseases
In August 2021, we acquired exclusive global rights to a cutting-edge platform of next-generation kinase inhibitors. This library of new chemical entities includes next-generation DYRK1 inhibitors, as well as other molecules that specifically inhibit Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (“LRRK2”), CDC2-like kinase (“CLK”), and TTK protein kinase (“TTK”), also known as Monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1) kinases. A number of these drug candidates have the potential to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, presenting an opportunity to address neuroinflammatory conditions of high unmet need, such as Down Syndrome, Alzheimer’s Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease, while other peripherally acting novel LRRK2, TTK, and CLK kinase inhibitors could be developed in additional therapeutic areas within autoimmunity, inflammation, and oncology. 
Compounds from the next-generation kinase inhibitor platform are covered by U.S. and foreign composition of matter patent applications, as well as other applications, that are currently pending in global prosecution. 
Topline Results of FRTX-02 (Phase 1 Part A and B) Clinical Trial
Study Design
The Phase 1 clinical trial of FRTX-02 is a two-part, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of FRTX-02 capsules in both healthy subjects and patients with AD. Part 1A of the study was a single ascending dose (“SAD”) assessment, which enrolled a total of 56 healthy subjects across seven cohorts (single oral dose of 10 to 600 mg FRTX-02 or placebo). Part 1B of the study was a multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) assessment, which enrolled a total of 33 healthy subjects across three cohorts (75, 150, and 300 mg FRTX-02 or placebo, once-daily for 14 days). Part 2 of the study is planned to compare once-daily oral doses of FRTX-02 to placebo in subjects with moderate-to-severe AD and include an exploratory evaluation of efficacy.
Safety
FRTX-02 was generally safe and well-tolerated in all seven SAD cohorts and in the 75 mg and 150 mg MAD cohorts, with no discontinuations due to Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (“TEAEs”). No drug-related serious adverse events were reported. All but two TEAEs were classified as mild, with a single count of moderate back pain in the SAD cohort (assessed as unlikely related to treatment) and moderate headache in the MAD cohort (assessed as possibly related to treatment). No dose-dependent trend in the frequency or severity of TEAEs was observed. There were no electrocardiogram or lab findings of clinical relevance in any of the SAD cohorts and in the 75 mg and 150 mg MAD cohorts. In the 300 mg MAD cohort, QTc prolongation was observed in two subjects at Days 8 and 9, respectively. Both subjects were asymptomatic, and their QTc intervals returned to baseline levels and remained in the normal range after cessation of dosing. All subjects completed their scheduled study assessments. 
Pharmacokinetics (“PK”)
A dose-proportional increase in exposure was observed through all SAD and MAD cohorts. PK data from the 75 mg and 150 mg MAD cohorts achieved maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) values at or above the pharmacologically active exposure levels observed across multiple nonclinical autoimmune and inflammatory disease models. The PK data support once-daily oral dosing with FRTX-02. The time of maximum plasma FRTX-02 concentration (Tmax) occurred between 2.65 to 3.25 hours post-dose, and a plasma half-life of approximately 16.0 to 28.0 hours was observed at Day 14 in the 75 mg and 150 mg MAD cohorts, respectively. A minimal-to-moderate accumulation following once-daily oral administration of 75 mg and 150 mg FRTX-02 over 14 days was observed, and steady state plasma concentrations were attained before Day 14.
Pharmacodynamics (“PD”)
As part of an exploratory PD assessment, ex vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated cytokine assays were conducted. FRTX-02 demonstrated a reduction in disease-relevant proinflammatory cytokines in whole blood, suggesting initial support for the FRTX-02 mechanism of action. Mean percent cytokine reduction from baseline after 14 days of once-daily 75 mg or 150 mg FRTX-02 treatment versus placebo were in the range of approximately 66% to 20% for IFNγ, IL-23, IL-10, IL-6, and TNFα. Additionally, maximum individual subject cytokine reductions from baseline were shown to be >90% for IFNγ, >50% for IL-23, IL-10, and TNFα, and approximately 40% for IL-6. 
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant change. While we believe that our team’s extensive pharmaceutical development and commercialization experience, scientific knowledge, and global 
industry relationships provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, over-the-counter companies, academic institutions, government agencies, and research institutions. 
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop, and manage a patented portfolio of product candidates that are safer and/or more effective than competing products.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in large part upon our ability to secure proprietary protection for our products and technologies, including those in development, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We seek to avoid the latter by monitoring patents and publications that may affect our business, and to the extent we identify such threats, evaluate and take appropriate courses of action. 
Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant, applicable laws allowing for patent term extension, and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent can vary from country to country and depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. 
We also intend to use regulatory exclusivity (also called data package exclusivity), or depending on eligibility, orphan drug designation, as a means of acquiring intellectual property protections that are separate and distinct to patents as appropriate for eligible pipeline candidates. These kinds of rights involve being given exclusivity for varying periods of time depending on the country to incentivize innovators who invest significant funds in and conduct clinical trials to produce necessary data to demonstrate a drug is safe and effective for its intended use(s) and, as such, the data package in a new drug application (“NDA”) for the FDA (or similar regulatory filings in other countries) should receive some degree of protection even if no patent is available, or exclusivity given to produce a treatment for a disease that otherwise would not realistically be invested in without such incentive. In addition, there are other forms of intellectual property protection we may seek worldwide, including but not limited to trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, pediatric exclusivity and the like, where available and appropriate for our business interests.
We further protect our proprietary information by requiring our directors, officers, employees, consultants, contractors, and other advisors to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also prevent them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to our company without adequate permission to do so. In addition, we require confidentiality or service agreements from third parties that receive our confidential information or materials. 
We aim to take advantage of a broad range of the intellectual property rights that are available to us and believe that this comprehensive approach will provide us with proprietary exclusive positions for our product candidates, where available. 
Strategic, Licensing, and Other Arrangements
License and Development Agreement with Voronoi
In August 2021, we entered into a license and development agreement (the “Voronoi License Agreement”) with Voronoi Inc. (“Voronoi”), pursuant to which we acquired exclusive, worldwide rights to research, develop, and commercialize FRTX-02 and other next-generation kinase inhibitors. In accordance with the terms of the

During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and through the date of this Annual Report, we did not make any payments or recorded any liabilities related to the specified development, regulatory, and commercial milestones or royalties on net sales pursuant to the Carna License Agreement.
Agreements with Botanix
Asset Purchase Agreement with Botanix 
On May 3, 2022 (the “Effective Date”), we and Brickell Subsidiary, Inc. (“Brickell Subsidiary”) entered into an asset purchase agreement with Botanix and Botanix Pharmaceuticals Limited (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which Botanix acquired and assumed control of all rights, title, and interests to assets primarily related to the proprietary compound sofpironium bromide that were owned and/or licensed by us or Brickell Subsidiary (the “Assets”). Prior to the sale of the Assets, we had previously entered into a License Agreement with Bodor, dated December 15, 2012 (last amended in February 2020) that provided us with a worldwide exclusive license to develop, manufacture, market, sell, and sublicense products containing sofpironium bromide through which the Assets were developed (the “Amended and Restated License Agreement”). As a result of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Botanix is now responsible for all further research, development, and commercialization of sofpironium bromide globally and replaced us as the exclusive licensee under the Amended and Restated License Agreement.
In accordance with the sublicense rights provided to us under the Amended and Restated License Agreement, we also had previously entered into a License, Development, and Commercialization Agreement with Kaken, dated as of March 31, 2015 (as amended in May 2018, the “Kaken Agreement”), under which we granted to Kaken an exclusive right to develop, manufacture, and commercialize the sofpironium bromide compound in Japan and certain other Asian countries (the “Territory”). In exchange for the sublicense, we were entitled to receive aggregate payments of up to $10.0 million upon the achievement of specified development milestones, which were earned and received in 2017 and 2018, and up to $19.0 million upon the achievement of sales-based milestones, as well as tiered royalties based on a percentage of net sales of licensed products in the Territory. In September 2020, Kaken received regulatory approval in Japan to manufacture and market ECCLOCK for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, and as a result, we began recognizing royalty revenue earned on a percentage of net sales of ECCLOCK in Japan. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Kaken Agreement was assigned to Botanix, which replaced us as the exclusive sub-licensor to Kaken.
We determined that the development of and ultimate sale and assignment of rights to the Assets is an output of our ordinary activities and Botanix is a customer as it relates to the sale of the Assets and related activities. 
In accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, in exchange for the Assets, we (i) received an upfront payment at closing in the amount of $3.0 million, (ii) were reimbursed for certain recent development expenditures in advancement of the Assets, (iii) received a milestone payment of $2.0 million upon the acceptance by the FDA in December 2022 of the filing of an NDA for sofpironium bromide gel, 15%, and (iv) will receive a contingent milestone payment of $4.0 million if marketing approval in the U.S. for sofpironium bromide gel, 15%, is received on or before September 30, 2023, or $2.5 million if such marketing approval is received after September 30, 2023 but on or before February 17, 2024. Botanix submitted an NDA for sofpironium bromide gel, 15%, to the FDA in September 2022, which was accepted by the FDA in December 2022. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, we also are eligible to receive additional success-based regulatory and sales milestone payments of up to $168.0 million. Further, we will receive tiered earnout payments ranging from high-single digits to mid-teen digits on net sales of sofpironium bromide gel (the “Earnout Payments”). 
The Asset Purchase Agreement also provides that Botanix will pay to us a portion of the sales-based milestone payments and royalties that Botanix receives from Kaken under the assigned Kaken Agreement (together, the “Sublicense Income”). Sublicense Income represents our estimate of payments that will be earned by us in the applicable period from sales-based milestone payments and royalties Botanix will receive from Kaken to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Royalties vary based on net sales that are impacted by a wide variety of market and other factors. We have recorded a contract asset equal to the amount of revenue recognized related to the Sublicense Income, less the amount of payments received from or due by Botanix in relation to the Sublicense Income.
All other consideration due under the Asset Purchase Agreement is contingent upon certain regulatory approvals and future sales subsequent to such regulatory approvals, or is based upon future sales that we determined are not yet probable due to such revenues being highly susceptible to factors outside of our influence and uncertainty about the amount of such consideration that will not be resolved for an extended period of time. Therefore, we determined that such variable consideration amounts are fully constrained as of December 31, 2022, and, as such, did not recognize such amounts as contract revenue.
Transition Services Agreement with Botanix
In connection with the sale of the Assets, on the Effective Date, we and Botanix entered into a transition services agreement (the “TSA”) whereby we are providing consulting services as an independent contractor to Botanix in support of and through filing and potential approval of the U.S. NDA for sofpironium bromide gel, 15%. In accordance with the terms of the TSA, in exchange for providing these services, (i) prior to the acceptance of the filing by the FDA of such NDA in December 2022, we received from Botanix a fixed monthly amount of $71 thousand, and (ii) after the acceptance of the filing in December 2022, we will receive 
from Botanix, a variable amount based upon actual hours worked, in each case plus related fees and expenses of our advisors (plus a 5% administrative fee) and our out-of-pocket expenses.
Contract Revenue under the Botanix Agreements 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded contract revenue of $6.9 million, of which $5.0 million related to upfront and milestones achieved under the Asset Purchase Agreement. For additional information regarding contract revenue described above, see Note 3. “Strategic Agreements” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Agreements with Bodor
In connection with the sale of the Assets, on the Effective Date, we, Brickell Subsidiary, and Bodor entered into an agreement (the “Rights Agreement”) to clarify that we and Brickell Subsidiary have the power and authority under the Amended and Restated License Agreement to enter into the Asset Purchase Agreement and the TSA, and that Botanix would assume the Amended and Restated License Agreement pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Rights Agreement includes a general release of claims and no admission of liability between the parties. Pursuant to such Rights Agreement, as subsequently amended on November 10, 2022, we have agreed to pay Bodor (i) 20% of the amount of each payment due to us from Botanix for upfront and milestone payments, subject to deductions, credits, or offsets applied under the Asset Purchase Agreement, as well as (ii) certain tiered payments, set as a percentage ranging from mid-single digits to mid-teen digits, of the amount of each of the applicable Earnout Payments due to us from Botanix after deductions, credits, or offsets applied under the Asset Purchase Agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, we retained our obligation under the Amended and Restated License Agreement to issue $1.0 million in shares of our common stock to Bodor upon the FDA’s acceptance of an NDA filing for sofpironium bromide gel, 15%. On November 10, 2022, we entered into an Acknowledgment and Agreement Related to Asset Purchase Agreement and Amended and Restated License Agreement (the “Acknowledgment”) with Brickell Subsidiary, Botanix, Botanix Pharmaceuticals Limited, and Bodor. Pursuant to the Acknowledgment, we paid $1.0 million in cash to Bodor in full satisfaction of this obligation to issue shares upon the FDA’s acceptance of the NDA.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, $1.9 million was incurred and reported as general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations associated with achieved milestones related to sofpironium bromide gel, 15%. For additional information regarding obligations due to Bodor described above, see Note 3. “Strategic Agreements” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Manufacturing and Supply
We currently contract with third parties for the manufacture of drug substances and drug products for use in nonclinical and clinical studies, and would expect to do so for any potential future commercial supply, and we intend to continue to do so in the future. To our knowledge, all of our clinical drug substance and drug product manufacturing activities are in compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) and other applicable laws. We have assembled a team of experienced employees and consultants to provide the necessary technical, quality, and regulatory oversight over the contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) with which we contract. We rely on third-party cGMP manufacturers for scale-up and process development work and to produce sufficient quantities of development product candidates for use in nonclinical and clinical studies. 
Government Regulation
FDA Drug Approval Process
In the U.S., prescription human drugs are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products, which apply to our pipeline of products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, corporate integrity agreements, and criminal prosecution. 
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves nonclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In addition, other tests on the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (“CMC”) of producing the drug and its various formulations to establish the shelf life, stability, storage conditions, and quality parameters and specifications must be conducted, submitted, and approved by the FDA. 
Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years at significant cost and the actual time required may vary substantially based on the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including current good laboratory practice (“GLP”) regulation. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product CMC described above and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the IND is considered in effect, and the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. 
Clinical trials involve the initial administration of the IND to healthy subjects or patients, with subsequent trials involving patients with the disease or disorder for which the investigational drug is being studied to treat, all under the supervision of qualified physician investigator(s). Clinical trials must be conducted (1) in compliance with federal and state regulations; (2) in compliance with current good clinical practice (“cGCP”) regulations, an international standard (as adopted by FDA) meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; and (3) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated as well as the actual primary and secondary endpoints of the study to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial participants. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to a local or central institutional review board (“IRB”) (outside the U.S., these are called Ethics Committees) for approval and oversight. An IRB may also 
require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or in rarer cases early phases may be skipped depending on the amount and quality of data that exists. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess pharmacological actions, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects associated with administration of the investigational drug and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients with the targeted disease or disorder, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled prospective Phase 3 clinical trials with statistically significant results to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug by comparing a treatment arm against a control (placebo or best supportive care) arm. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in limited instances for FDA registration where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of an effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically impossible or ethically problematic. 
After completion of required clinical testing, applicable law requires that an NDA be prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s efficacy, safety, quality, and manufacturing. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. Payment of a user fee is not expected to be required for filing of an initial NDA, because FDA guidance waives, or reduces, user fees for, among other things, a small business applicant submitting its first NDA. 
The FDA has 60 calendar days from its receipt of an NDA submission to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed with Congress to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Priority review can be applied to drugs that treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. In addition, the FDA provides an accelerated approval mechanism applied to investigational drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. 
The FDA also may refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes independent clinicians and other experts in the targeted disease, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more of the sponsor’s clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCPs. Additionally, the FDA will generally inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an investigational product unless compliance with cGMP is 
satisfactory and the NDA contains data sufficient to support the labeled shelf life and to demonstrate that the drug can be manufactured reliably in a stable, controlled manner.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and potentially the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information required. 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug in the U.S. with specific prescribing information for specific indications and may contain certain post-marketing requirements, including additional surveillance of how the drug is used. The approval letter may contain safety information that limits the ability of the drug to be marketed (e.g., black box warning) or contains contraindications, warnings, and/or precautions that limit the potential of the drug’s desirability (these are standard for most approved drugs). As another potential condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) for drugs that are effective but also have potentially significant safety concerns. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. As stated, product approval may require post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy, which could be substantial. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance by the drug’s sponsor with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing and/or manufacturing by the sponsor or in how the drug is being used in the marketplace.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. Also, an NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates, in part, the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, social media, off-label promotion, formulary and reimbursement presentations, product sampling, sales force activities including dissemination of peer-reviewed journal articles, marketing items and detailing practices with prescribers, healthcare practitioner interactions, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, other promotional activities involving the internet and to certain other press, publicity and media communications initiated by us, while other parts of the government regulate, among other things, against false claims, foreign corrupt practices, trade sanctions, and anti-kickbacks. States often impose strict legal requirements and prohibitions on a variety of post-approval drug marketing practices. We may market drugs holding an approved NDA only for the permitted indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 
Adverse event reporting, pharmacovigilance, and submission of periodic reports are required of the NDA holder following FDA approval of that NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, the aforementioned REMS, and/or surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product, especially in the U.S. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to 
register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs or risk being sanctioned by the FDA from supplying the drugs they manufacture or facing partial or complete product recalls. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request such product recalls if a company fails to comply with applicable regulatory standards, if we encounter problems following initial marketing and supply, or if previously unrecognized problems with the drug being prescribed subsequently are discovered. 
The Hatch-Waxman Act
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each eligible patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the “Orange Book.” Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, nonclinical or clinical studies to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug and may be required to be switched to from the original listed drug by certain laws or insurance and formulary practices, which can affect the profitability of the original listed drug adversely. 
To proceed forward, the ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify either that (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant also may elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA will not be approved until all the listed patents, if valid, claiming the referenced product expire. 
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then commence a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 calendar days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of (i) 30 months; (ii) expiration of the patent; (iii) settlement of the lawsuit; or (iv) a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
The ANDA also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product expires.
Regulatory Exclusivity
Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (“NCE”), which is a drug that contains no active molecule that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity in the 
U.S. during which the FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. Other countries may, and do, have different periods for regulatory exclusivity.
An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.
Patent Term Extension
After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent term extension in the U.S. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase, the time between IND application and NDA submission, and all of the review phase, the time between NDA submission and approval, up to a maximum of five years. Only one patent may be extended for a regulatory review period for any product. If more than one application for extension of the same patent is filed, the certificate of extension of patent term, if appropriate, will be issued based upon the first filed application for extension. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years. 
For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
It is premature to know what, and if any, patent term extension that may be allowed in the U.S. would be at this time, or which patent an extension may be triggered from.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, including when a clinical trial is initiated (often on www.clintrials.gov); information for certain Company studies can be accessed at this website. Information related to the product, patient population, phase, type and scope of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration process. Sponsors are obligated also to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion and industry trade association ethics guidelines require publication of both favorable and unfavorable study results, which can affect the potential market for a drug. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress and intent of development programs. 
Regulation Outside of the U.S.
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to regulations of other countries governing any clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates, as well as the extent, scope, and enforceability of intellectual property rights associated with the product candidate introduced in these other countries. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we, or our local partners, must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before it can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may market products in those countries or areas. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a 
process similar to the FDA’s that requires the submission of a clinical trial application (“CTA”), much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In some cases, once the investigational drug is approved by a regulatory agency in certain established markets, like the FDA in the U.S., other countries will allow a sponsor to rely on that other country’s approval and extend it, with the same terms and conditions, in the foreign country and this may accelerate the introduction of the drug in foreign markets, where applicable (often called a free sales certificate (“FSC”), or also a certificate of pharmaceutical products, process). 
Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, or diabetes and is optional for those medicines which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 calendar days of receiving the applications and assessments report, each member state must decide whether to recognize the national marketing authorization of a different member state.
Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws in the U.S. have been applied to restrict or prohibit certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include, among others, anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes and other statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, and anticorruption. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended (“PPACA”), amended the intent element of the federal anti-kickback statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. 
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, also may violate federal false claims laws. Additionally, PPACA amended the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under certain federal false claims laws. 
The majority of U.S. states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 
Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the healthcare fraud and false statements statutes, which prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. 
Violations of these federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws are punishable in the U.S. by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. 
Other Federal and State Regulatory Requirements 
Under the Open Payments Rule, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services requires certain manufacturers of prescription drugs to annually collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to certain healthcare professionals, including physicians, and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Other countries require similar reporting, including France and Belgium, if the product is approved and marketed there. In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners and entities in these states. Other states prohibit various other marketing-related activities. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Some of the state laws are broader in scope than federal laws. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time-consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil or other penalties. 
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our product candidates, if approved, by us or any potential commercial partners will depend, in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers, and other organizations.
The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce a physician’s willingness to prescribe our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a 
drug does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate.
In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of drugs, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.
