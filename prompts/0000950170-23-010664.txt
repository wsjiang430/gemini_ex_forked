 Item 1. Business.
 Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to “Biote” refer to Biote and its subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Business Combination (as defined herein), or the Company from and after the Business Combination in the present tense. Biote’s business and the industry in which Biote operates is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report. These and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the estimates made by the independent parties and by Biote.
Overview
 We operate a high-growth practice-building business within the hormone optimization space. Similar to a franchise model, we provide the necessary components to enable Biote-certified practitioners to establish, build, and successfully implement a program designed to optimize hormone levels using personalized solutions for their patient populations. The Biote Method is a comprehensive, end-to-end practice building platform that provides Biote-certified practitioners with the following components specifically developed for practitioners in the hormone optimization space: Biote Method education, training and certification, practice management software, inventory management software, and information regarding available HRT products, as well as digital and point-of-care marketing support. We also sell a complementary Biote-branded line of dietary supplements. We generate revenues by charging the Biote-partnered clinics fees associated with the support Biote provides for HRT and from the sale of Biote-branded dietary supplements. By virtue of our historical performance over the 11 years ended December 31, 2022, we believe that our business model has been successful, remains differentiated, and is well positioned for future growth.
 By incorporating the Biote Method in their practices, we enable practitioners to participate in the large and growing hormone optimization space. Bioidentical hormone therapy, which is offered by Biote-certified practitioners, is one segment of the large HRT market. It is estimated that, as of 2020, the total U.S. market opportunity for HRT products, available in various forms, exceeds $7 billion and is expected to grow 7% annually through 2026. We believe our business opportunity in providing educational and practice management services is large and will similarly grow. Growth in this field is expected to be fueled by “aging” demographics and expanding consumer demand for medical information and treatment options to address hormonal imbalances.
 Patient symptoms associated with menopause in women and andropause in men, such as hot flashes, night sweats, depressed mood, low libido, weight gain, and issues with concentration and focus, while negatively impacting quality of life, may also be associated with higher risks for chronic diseases attributable to declining hormone levels, including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and breast cancer. Approximately 13.8 million men over age 45 in the United States are affected by hypogonadism and only about 1.3 million (9%) of those affected undergo testosterone treatment. An average of 27 million women between the ages of 45 and 64, or 20% of the American workforce, experience menopause every year. Despite the prevalence of symptoms-84% of women report menopausal symptoms that interfere with their lives-only 58% have discussed menopause with a health provider, and only 28%, or approximately 13 million, undergo HRT (and of that 28%, only 31%, or approximately 4 million, undergo bioidentical HRT). By 2030, over 1.2 billion women, 14% of the global population, will be in menopause or post-menopause. Yet, despite the growing number of women experiencing menopause, they remain an underserved population.
 One key driver of this unmet medical need is the lack of knowledge and experience of treating physicians. For many practitioners, the last time they received meaningful instruction on treating menopause and andropause was during medical school. Based on a 2018 article by Jennifer Wolff, entitled “What Doctors Don’t Know About Menopause,” among newer doctors surveyed in 2015, 80% of medical residents reported feeling “barely comfortable” discussing or treating menopause. While this knowledge gap applies to training, we believe it also applies to the understanding of treatment alternatives, access to new therapies, methods to drive efficiencies in a hormone optimization practice and finally, how to profitably treat this growing population.
 To capitalize on this large and underserved market opportunity, we developed a highly differentiated practice-building platform to enable practitioners to treat the hormone imbalance symptoms experienced by their patients. The Biote Method has been designed specifically for practitioners who focus on treating perimenopause in women; post-menopause in women; and andropause/hypogonadism in men. It is constructed to bridge the existing gaps which exist in education and treatment options, while improving the efficiency of practitioners’ business operations and the hormone health of their aging patient base. Over the past 11 years, we have built our platform to provide highly differentiated education and training, practice support resources and inventory management tools that would be difficult for a practice to otherwise attain on their own.
 We empower Biote-certified practitioners by requiring rigorous in-person training, testing and certification for all Biote-certified practitioners and office staff wishing to use the Biote Method in their practice. Our practitioner instructors are among the nation’s most experienced clinical experts in hormonal therapy, including multiple modalities of HRT such as creams, gels, patches, pills, injections and compounded bioidentical hormone pellets. We teach clinicians how to identify early indicators of hormone-related aging conditions, and we believe we are the top practitioner educators by virtue of our experience over 11 years, with over 3 million hormone optimization procedures performed by Biote-certified practitioners to date, including approximately 300,000 active patients.
We offer training centrally and regionally to provide consistent and ongoing technical education. On an ongoing basis, we provide access to around-the-clock clinical and technical support for Biote-certified practitioners.
 To offer a turnkey platform, we leverage the data Biote-certified practitioners collect using our BioTracker software for regulatory and record management to seamlessly assess a simple procedure-based revenue model that encompasses fees for the education, training, re-training, comprehensive administrative services and support and pass-through cost of pellets that practitioners may choose to provide as part of the Biote Method. We believe our revenue model represents an objective method to assess fees across the varying size and sophistication of our Biote-certified practitioners and clinics beginning with the first day of training and continuing throughout the treatment of each practitioner’s patient. Additionally, this revenue model provides our Biote-certified practitioners with consistency and predictability, notwithstanding the variability in services required to support their practices during any given period. Our revenue model also offers efficiency and transparency for inventory management, as each procedure is electronically recorded through our technology platform without requiring additional workflow.
 The Biote Method’s proprietary clinical decision support (“CDS”) assists physicians in establishing individualized dosing for patients. Our BioTracker software and business tools allow practitioners to efficiently manage the record management, product acquisition, inventory logistics and the business end of a robust hormone optimization practice. We provide Biote-partnered clinics access to FDA-registered outsourcing facilities that can supply a wide array of hormone optimization products for Biote-certified practitioner patients. We provide information to Biote-certified practitioners regarding how to integrate with our BioTracker software. Our BioTracker software allows Biote-certified practitioners to manage orders and maintain accurate inventory records to keep their regulatory and business systems up to date.
 Beyond the breadth and depth of our commercial and operational platform, the Biote name has achieved strong brand recognition among practitioners and patients in the communities we serve, as illustrated by QY Research’s market research publication entitled “South & North America Hormone Replacement Therapy Market Insights and Forecast to 2026.” Practitioners undertaking the Biote Method can be confident that our exclusive training and practice building tools will prepare them to provide excellent and differentiated care to patients. This has led to high practitioner satisfaction and above 90% retention rate among Biote-certified practitioners. We are contracted with and provide comprehensive support to over 6,400 practitioners that have adopted the Biote Method in their practices. Leveraging our brand strength, we offer marketing assistance, including office signage and patient education materials, to every Biote-certified practitioner within our network.
 We believe by virtue of their participation in our robust training and practice certification, Biote-certified practitioners are well informed on all aspects of hormone optimization. We believe our brand advantage with both practitioners and patients is a key element of our commercial growth strategy, and an asset that we intend to leverage to expand our business.
 Complementing the Biote Method is our expanding line of private-labeled dietary supplements to address hormone, vitamin, and physiological deficiencies that regularly manifest in an aging population. This business segment appeals to practitioners’ patient demographic and enables patients the opportunity to receive practitioner-recommended Biote-branded dietary supplements to support healthy aging. By leveraging our existing Biote-certified practitioner base to sell and distribute our Biote-branded dietary supplements, we believe we have created an efficient and complementary business.
 We also designed the Biote Method to permit beneficial practice economics for our Biote-partnered clinics. Our educational training and practice management platform helps enable Biote-partnered clinics to execute this all-cash model with minimal reimbursement risk. This contrasts to consistently decreasing reimbursement rates for most other treatments and therapies offered by physician offices.
 We have a track record of consistently achieving accelerated and highly profitable growth. Our four-year revenue CAGR from 2016-2020 was 22%. Our revenue was $165.0 million and $139.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net income was $1.3 million and $32.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
 The Clinical Need to Treat Hormone Imbalance
 Biote-certified practitioners primarily focus their treatments on women experiencing symptoms due to hormonal imbalance before, during, and after menopause, and men experiencing symptoms of hypogonadism and male sex hormone deficiency. According to a 2015 study entitled “Use of Compounded Hormone Therapy in the United States: Report of The North American Menopause Society Survey,” by Margery L.S. Gass, Cynthia A. Stuenkel, Wulf H. Utian, Andrea LaCroix, James H. Liu and Jan L. Shifren, it is estimated that as many as 200 million Americans are affected by hormonal imbalance and approximately 80% are untreated, according to a 2014 study entitled “Systematic Literature Review of the Epidemiology of Nongenetic Forms of Hypogonadism in Adult Males” by Victoria Zarotsky, et al. The corresponding treatment market for hormone replacement therapies is large and diverse, both in terms of the number of products, the number of suppliers, the type of administration and regulatory requirements for producing and distributing these products. Bioidentical optimization, which provides hormone supplementation that can be administered to patients just two or three times per year, is a highly differentiated segment of this market. Biote-certified practitioners perform about 80% of their hormone optimization procedures on female patients and approximately 20% of such procedures on male patients. As the U.S. population continues to age, we believe the number of patients seeking relief from the symptoms of hormone imbalance will continue to grow.)
Menopausal Symptoms Segment (Female)
 Approximately 40-50 million women in the U.S. will experience hot flashes, a symptom of menopause, according to a study entitled “Psychosocial and Socioeconomic Burden of Vasomotor Symptoms in Menopause: A Comprehensive Review” by Wulf H. Utian. Based on a study entitled “Change in Follicle- Stimulating and Estradiol Across the Menopausal Transition: Effect of Age at the Final Menstrual Period” by John F. Randolph, et al., Women experience a 67% reduction in estradiol between their mid-40s and mid-50s. Testosterone, a prevalent sex hormone in the female body also starts decreasing early, and by age 40, a woman has lost half of her testosterone production. Based on a 2018 article by Shelly Emling, entitled “Menopause Symptoms Can Last Decades,” this decline in hormone production and the resulting imbalance between estrogen and testosterone levels results in menopause symptoms that can continue for 10 years or more. According to a 1984 study, entitled “The Effects of Subcutaneous Hormone Implants During Climacteric” by Linda Cardozo, et al., these menopause symptoms include, but are not limited to:

• Hot flashes• Night sweats / excessive sweating•Sleep disturbance• Irritability / anxiety• Depressed mood• Brain fog | • Low libido• Vaginal dryness•Fatigue / exhaustion•Joint / muscle ache•Weight gain•Decrease in bone density

 Beyond immediate symptoms, medical evidence exists linking untreated hormone imbalance with more serious health risks. A substantial collection of studies and analyses reported in the medical literature further illustrates the association between HRT and a deceased risk of heart disease, breast cancer, osteoporosis, and neurodegenerative diseases. For example, Dr. Rebecca L. Glaser, a prominent breast cancer surgeon, studied the incidence of breast cancer during 10 years of treating menopausal women with testosterone. In a study entitled “Incidence of Invasive Breast Cancer in Women Treated with Testosterone Implants: A Prospective 10-year Cohort Study,” she concluded that testosterone was demonstrated to be associated with a 39% reduction in the incidence of invasive breast cancer compared to the age-matched SEER expected incidence. Additionally, a study entitled “Efficacy of Pharmacological Therapies for the Prevention of Fractures in Postmenopausal Women: A Network Meta-Analysis” by Patricia Barrionuevo, et al. published a systemic analysis of pharmacological therapies for prevention of fractures in postmenopausal women and concluded that estrogen with progesterone produces reductions in hip fractures, non-vertebral fractures and vertebral fractures.
 Menopause treatment options involving hormones are most frequently comprised of estrogen, testosterone and/or progesterone. Hormones are available in a broad range of formulations administered as oral tablets, injectable, gels, creams, pellet implants and vaginal devices.
 Oral Estrogen +/- Progesterone formulations-Routinely prescribed as estrogen tablets or estrogen plus progesterone tablets (depending on uterus status), parenteral and oral dosage forms are the most widely prescribed HRT products. Practitioners can choose to prescribe from a number of oral estrogens, with the most popular being estradiol, estrone, estropipate and conjugated estrogens.
 Testosterone Therapy-The use of testosterone for the treatment of female menopause symptoms has been well established for more than 70 years, as evidenced by a 1949 study entitled “Indications for Hormonal Pellets in the Therapy of Endocrine and Gynecic Disorders” by Robert B. Greenblatt & Susan R. Roland. Despite this scientific and clinical evidence, there is no FDA-approved testosterone therapy for use in females. Practitioners desiring to use testosterone for their female patients need to choose between prescribing off-label use of testosterone products approved exclusively for male use, or testosterone products custom-formulated and compounded by pharmacies for use in female patients which is consistent with the Biote Method.
 The lack of testosterone products approved for women contrasts with the extensive peer-reviewed literature that consists of studies showing that testosterone levels drop in women with age, particularly in menopause, and that testosterone supplementation improves sexual health and addresses symptoms associated with menopause.
 The Cochrane Review analysis of trials addressing therapy targeting hypoactive female sexual desire disorder, and two meta-analyses published by Chiara Achilli, et al. and Rakibul M Islam, et al., entitled “Efficacy and Safety of Transdermal Testosterone in Postmenopausal Women with Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis” and “Safety and Efficacy of Testosterone for Women: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomised Controlled Trial Data,” respectively, all concluded that testosterone therapy produces statistically significant improvement in multiple measures relating to menopausal women’s sexual heath. In addition, preliminary studies, including “Mechanisms of Testosterone Deficiency-related Endothelial Dysfunction” by Alexios S. Antonopoulos & Charalambos Antoniades, “Testosterone Therapy and Cardiovascular Risk: Advances and Controversies” by Abraham Morgentaler, et al. and “Breast Cancer Incidence Reduction in Women Treated with Subcutaneous Testosterone: Testosterone Therapy and Breast Cancer Incidence Study” by Dr. Gary S. Donovitz & Mandy Cotton, report marked improvements in other menopausal symptoms and potential beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk, breast cancer risk, bone growth, depressed mood, and exhaustion.
Hypogonadism & Sex Hormone Segment (Male)
 Male hypogonadism is a deficiency in testosterone. It is characterized by serum testosterone levels of less than 300 ng/dL in combination with at least one clinical sign or symptom, according to a 2010 study by Peeyush Kumar, et al., entitled “Male hypogonadism: Symptoms and Treatment.” In the period through their 20s, male testosterone levels are approximately 700 ng/dL or higher (in a range of 600-1300 ng/dL) as presented in a study entitled “Reference Ranges for Testosterone in Men Generated Using Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry in a Community-Based Sample of Healthy Nonobese Young Men in the Framingham Heart Study and Applied to Three Geographically Distinct Cohorts” by Shalender Bhasin, et al. In men, testosterone levels decline 1-1.5% per year after age thirty, according to “Age, disease, and changing sex hormone levels in middle-aged men: results of the Massachusetts Male Aging Study” by Anna Gray, Henry A Feldman, John B. McKinlay and Christopher Longcope. Multiple studies on hypogonadism, including “Age Trends in the Level of Serum Testosterone and Other Hormones in Middle-Aged Men: Longitudinal Results from the Massachusetts Male Aging Study” by Henry A. Feldman, et al. and “Prevalence of Hypogonadism in Males Aged at Least 45 years: The HIM Study” by Thomas Mulligan, et al., estimate the prevalence of low testosterone (total testosterone less than 300 ng/dL) is as high as 38.7% in males over 45. Not every male experiences testosterone decline at the same rate or to the same level, but over time, all males experience testosterone level decrease. Men experience a 44% average reduction in testosterone between ages 30 and 74, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Testosterone deficiency is a clinical syndrome that relates to a man’s symptoms and physical signs, not necessarily to the specific level detected in a blood test. There are many men suffering from testosterone deficiency who may not have laboratory values less than 300 ng/dL. The primary signs of low testosterone include:

• Decrease in libido• Memory, focus and concentration issues•Sarcopeia or muscle loss | • Decrease bone mineral density• Erectile Dysfunction (ED)

 A 2019 study entitled “Testosterone Therapy in Men with Hypogonadism Prevents Progression from Prediabetes to Type 2 Diabetes: Eight-year Data from a Registry Study” published by Aksam Yassin, et al. supports the use of testosterone as a treatment for diabetes in hypogonadal men.
 Hormone Imbalance: The Treatment Challenge
 Hormone imbalance symptoms experienced by aging men and women can be highly bothersome, and negatively impact quality of life. Current demographics indicate the number of adults experiencing menopause and andropause symptoms is large and expanding. Under the best of circumstances, the surge in people requiring medical care might overwhelm available resources. Adding to this situation, significant gaps exist that exacerbate the treatment challenge:
 •Practitioner education in the diagnosis and treatment of menopause and andropause symptoms is frequently dated, leaving them unprepared on how to best manage these patients with optimal and contemporary therapies.
 •While extensive peer-reviewed literature extolling the benefits of testosterone therapy exists, FDA-approved medications exist for males only.
 •There is low awareness among both medical and public audiences of alternative hormone optimization therapies.
 •Given pressing workloads and declining reimbursements, physicians have little practical incentives to invest their time and resources (or that of their staff) in exploring new treatment modalities.
 Taken together, we believe these factors have resulted in a medical system often ill-prepared to treat menopause and andropause and patients, particularly women, needlessly suffering its symptoms. We believe that the Biote Method is well designed to help partnered clinics overcome these challenges.
 What We Offer
 Biote Business Model/Solution
 We have developed a comprehensive platform for Biote-certified practitioners to establish and operate a personalized hormone optimization program in their practices. Biote-certified practitioners seek to optimize imbalances in their patients’ hormone, vitamin, and mineral levels and may prescribe bioidentical hormone therapies and/or recommend dietary supplements to accomplish this end.
 We believe our competitive advantage lies in the breadth and completeness of our offering, which supports practices in pursuing excellence in all facets of patient care. We provide partnered clinics with up-to-date scientific education delivered by highly experienced practitioner instructors. Our training content is based on a scientifically rigorous approach and is continually updated. We further provide Biote-certified practitioners with the clinical mentorship, practice support resources, inventory management tools and marketing capability necessary to operate an efficient hormone optimization practice. Biote-certified practitioners can access FDA-registered outsourcing facilities that can supply hormone optimization therapies should practitioners determine such treatment is appropriate for their patients. Further, our practice management software allows Biote-certified practitioners to efficiently order, track
and manage hormone optimization product inventory, and meet other administrative requirements. Our BioTracker software is integrated with the outsourcing facilities’ own software to facilitate ordering and inventory control.
 Biote-certified practitioners who are trained in the Biote Method may prescribe bioidentical compounded hormone pellets prepared by independent third-party compounding pharmacies, known as outsourcing facilities, which are governed by Section 503B of the FDCA. Section 503B includes requirements regarding registration and reporting, use of bulk drug substances in compounding, a prohibition on compounding copies of FDA-approved drugs and wholesaling, and certain requirements for labeling, among others. Entities registering as outsourcing facilities are subject to current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) requirements and regular FDA inspections, among other requirements.
 Drugs compounded by outsourcing facilities in compliance with Section 503B are exempt from the new drug approval requirements of the FDCA and certain labeling requirements of the FDCA. This means that FDA does not review or verify the safety or effectiveness of compounded products distributed or dispensed by outsourcing facilities; rather Section 503B of the FDCA establishes standards for manufacturing processes and controls applicable to outsourcing facilities as a means to ensure drug quality. Section 503B outsourcing facilities are subject to FDA inspection and are inspected by FDA on a risk-based schedule.
 Biote contracts with operators of certain FDA-registered 503B outsourcing facilities, namely AnazaoHealth Corporation, or AnazaoHealth, Right Value Drug Stores, LLC d/b/a Carie Boyd’s Prescription Shop, or Carie Boyd’s, and F.H. Investments, Inc. d/b/a Asteria Health. While Biote-certified practitioners have the option to use a variety of different outsourcing facilities, AnazaoHealth, Carie Boyd’s and Asteria Health are the primary outsourcing facilities for the compounded testosterone and estradiol implantable subcutaneous pellets used by Biote-certified practitioners as part of the Biote Method. It is Biote’s understanding that these 503B outsourcing facilities make these compounded drugs from bulk substances that comport with FDA’s final guidance on its interim policy on bulk substances. However, we do not control or direct the compounding or manufacturing processes of these 503B outsourcing facilities. While Biote generates revenue by charging the Biote-partnered clinics procedure-based fees associated with the Biote-provided end-to-end platform for running an efficient practice that includes tracking compounded products ordered from 503B outsourcing facilities, as well as other services, Biote does not receive compensation for the sale of bioidentical pellets from these 503B outsourcing facilities to Biote-certified practitioners. For more information about compounding facilities, please see the section entitled “Regulation of Compounded Drug Products.”
 Our Biote-branded dietary supplements are a natural extension of our practice-building business and represent approximately 20% of our annual revenues. We sell dietary supplements that may support hormone, vitamin and physiological balances in an aging population. Our Biote-branded dietary supplements provide Biote-certified practitioners with an opportunity to further balance other important aspects of a patient’s profile and simultaneously increase practice revenue. Biote-partnered clinics directly purchase Biote-branded dietary supplements from us, and our third-party logistics (“3PL” suppliers fill and ship directly to the ordering practice. The Biote-partnered clinic then sets their own pricing in compliance with our applicable policies and sells Biote-branded dietary supplements directly to patients. We have leveraged out existing commercial infrastructure and relationships with Biote-certified practitioners to build our Biote-branded dietary supplement business. As a result, as of December 2022, approximately 93% of Biote-branded dietary supplements were sold through Biote-certified practitioners. Approximately 77% of our partnered clinics offer Biote-branded dietary supplements, for an average supplement volume per practice of approximately $11,500 as of 2022.
 Hormone Therapy
 The Biote Method is purpose built to enable Biote-certified practitioners to treat hormone imbalance using bioidentical estrogen and testosterone products as necessary. The term bioidentical refers to hormone formulations that match the hormones of the human body. Estradiol (the most active estrogen), progesterone and testosterone can be produced as bioidentical formulations.
 Estradiol is FDA approved and commercially available under several different brand names. Examples include Vivelle Dot (patch), Estrogel, Elestrin, Evamist, Vagifem, Estring and FemRing.
 Testosterone can be formulated for use by both women and men. However, FDA-approved testosterone products exist exclusively for males. Testopel is an example.
 Progesterone is FDA approved, and available commercially as a capsule of micronized progesterone in peanut (or olive) oil. Progesterone is also available in patch and cream formulations. Prometrium is an example.
 Hormones that are not bioidentical are commonly known as synthetic hormone formulations. Examples of synthetic hormones include conjugated equine estrogens, oral contraceptive pills, medroxyprogesterone (Provera) and methyltestosterone.
 The Biote Method is focused on promoting the use of bioidentical hormones to provide optimized clinical results using bioidentical estrogen, progesterone and testosterone rather than synthetic, chemically-modified versions of the hormone. The Biote Method encourages practitioners to begin each patient treatment with comprehensive lab testing, which includes checking testosterone, thyroid and vitamin levels. Patients complete symptom questionnaires to enable practitioners to appropriately gauge symptom scores. These questionnaires and lab results are evaluated by the practitioner, along with patient data such as age, weight, medical history and desired outcomes. The Biote software then can assist Biote-certified practitioners in developing patient-specific treatment options.

Biote-certified practitioners utilize a wide variety of hormone therapies. In addition to bioidentical hormone pellets, practitioners may also choose to administer hormone therapy to their patients via topical methods (creams, gels, patches), oral methods (sublingual tablets, pills) or injections, depending on the practitioners’ medical assessment of their patients’ clinical needs. Creams, lotions and patches are prescribed on a per patient basis and obtained from pharmacies. If the physician chooses to utilize pellets, they generally administer the pellets that they obtain from 503B outsourcing facilities through “in office” procedures.
 In a 2014 study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, pellet therapy was chosen by 17% of 382 male patients when presented with the choice of the following methods of hormone therapy: gels, injections and implantable subcutaneous pellets. Further, according to a 2013 study published in the same journal, of 113 men who underwent subcutaneous testosterone pellet therapy, 52.2% had switched to pellet therapy from topical gel therapy and 35.4% had switched from injection therapy.
 The Biote Difference
 Biote training and certification program—For many practitioners, medical school was the last time they received instruction in menopause, andropause and hormone deficiency. In fact, according to a 2018 article, in a survey of more than 1,000 medical professionals, only 57% reported being “up-to-date” on information regarding HRT for menopause symptoms. Effectively managing hormone levels is an involved, complex and highly data-intensive process. We believe that contemporary medical training is a critical element of our platform and seek to bridge any gap in a practitioner’s experience and clinical education. To become a Biote-certified practitioner, we carefully vet healthcare providers to ensure they possess the necessary commitment, patient population and office staff needed to build a successful hormone optimization practice.
 Prospective practitioners and their staff attend a two-day Biote Method training program. The training includes didactic lectures designed to educate practitioners on the latest science of HRT. The training program also includes in-clinic training during which practitioners gain experience performing hormone replacement procedures in a supervised setting. We also understand the importance of staff interaction in any patient experience and require each prospective Biote-partnered clinic’s office staff to attend training regarding the best practices for maintaining a hormone therapy practice. We believe that this comprehensive training program, as well as continuing education and mentoring, is critical to the successful establishment of new Biote-certified practitioners.
 In addition to completing training, Biote-certified practitioners must:
 •Be in good standing with their respective state professional licensing board;
 •Successfully pass a post-training certification exam / requirements;
 •Utilize our BioTracker platform to comply with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s (the “DEA”) inventory control regulations for all scheduled drugs; and
 •Use our proprietary technology, including training materials, therapy instruction and training videos to facilitate optimal therapy and patient outcomes.
 Biote training facilities & faculty—We operate one national and five regional training facilities for Biote-certified practitioners, healthcare providers and medical staff. The 10-person practitioner clinical faculty and 15 medical advisors provide on-site and virtual educational programs, seminars, training, refresher courses in hormone optimization, vitamin and Biote-branded dietary supplement guidance, and other topics. As of December 2022, over 6,400 providers in more than 3,600 clinics nationwide have successfully completed our rigorous curriculum and clinical training program. Upon completion, each Biote-certified practitioner is teamed with an experienced Biote-certified practitioner who is committed to providing mentorship and guidance, including with respect to regulatory compliance, education and new research updates.
 Biote BioTracker system—We require Biote-partnered clinics to keep patient and inventory records, which was accomplished historically with manually-completed paper copies. To help our practitioners automate this process, we offer as part of our platform the BioTracker system, which provides inventory management services to enable Biote-partnered clinics to comply with federal (DEA) and applicable state regulations for the hormones that Biote-certified practitioners may order from 503B outsourcing facilities. Our BioTracker software is integrated with the outsourcing facilities’ software to facilitate ordering and inventory control. As each Biote-partnered clinic stores and dispenses these hormones, this software performs the critical function of monitoring and tracking the necessary detail regarding the administration of controlled substances. BioTracker also provides robust data analytics which allows the practitioner to effectively manage their processes and internal records. We also leverage this data to electronically transmit to us the number of hormone optimization pellet insertion procedures performed, affording us the most direct way to seamlessly assess a fair, transparent and consistent fee for our Biote Method, including the education, training, re-training and comprehensive services and support.
 Biote Clinical Decision Support software—The CDS is part of our offerings available to Biote-certified practitioners. The CDS programs assist practitioners in identifying potential patient-specific treatment options and provides these practitioners with access to publications and guidelines that serve as independently verifiable bases for treatment recommendations. The practitioner enters a patient’s clinical markers into the program, and an algorithm based on the published literature with clinical data and clinical guidelines suggests potential individualized treatment option for the practitioner’s evaluation and consideration. While Biote-certified
practitioners may consider the treatment options identified by the CDS, responsibility for treatment decisions remains solely with the practitioners in the exercise of their independent medical judgment.
 Biote-branded Dietary Supplements—Our expanding Biote-branded dietary supplements business sells dietary supplements that may support hormone, vitamin and physiological balances in an aging population. We introduced our line of Biote-branded dietary supplements in 2013 with two specific dietary supplement products, DIM SGS+ and ADK 5. The line has since grown to include 19 dietary supplements, priced between $20.25 and $99. We offer wholesale sales directly to over 2,200 Biote-certified practitioners through our own eCommerce site, efficiently leveraging the core Biote provider platform. Practitioners then re-sell to their patients through online stores or in-clinic. As of December 2022, 77% of Biote-partnered clinics also offer our Biote-branded dietary supplement products. Biote-branded dietary supplement sales accounted for approximately 19.5% of our revenue in both 2022 and 2021.
 In 2021, we launched a direct-to-patient eCommerce platform whereby practitioners can invite their patients to buy Biote-branded dietary supplement products online via their own online store. Enhancements to the direct-to-patient platform included a subscription service that launched in early 2022 for added convenience to patients, and to help drive reoccurring revenue for both us and Biote-partnered clinics. Our team plans to continue researching new formulations, product expansion opportunities and architecting an innovation pipeline that will offer solutions and revenue expansion for our practitioners and for Biote.
 We believe that as awareness of our Biote brand name associated with our supplements continues to increase, so too will the incidence of our Biote-branded dietary supplements being sold in online stores. In the broader global dietary supplement market, by 2025, it is estimated that approximately 26% of sales will be generated through online markets, mirroring trends across global retail trade. We are preparing for this shift with the introduction of an online direct-to-patient store in conjunction with expanding our digital marketing outreach.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe we are a leader in the practice-building market focused on the hormone optimization space as evidenced by our size as compared to competitors. We have designed the Biote Method to offer practitioners an end-to-end platform to enable them to successfully establish and grow a profitable hormone therapy practice.
 Proprietary end-to-end hormone optimization platform—The Biote Method provides a comprehensive solution that quickly enables new clinics to effectively start and run an efficient bioidentical HRT practice. Our two-day mandatory, practitioner-paid training program educates the practitioner on clinical and back-office aspects of treating patients. Biote’s CDS identifies treatment options while customized practice management and data software enable efficient workflow and inventory and vendor management. By virtue of the breadth and quality of the systems and services provided by the Biote Method, we believe our platform is differentiated within our industry and represents a competitive advantage.
 Accretive practice economics—Our relationship with Biote-certified practitioners delivers positive practice economics. As of July 2021, Biote-partnered clinics generated average profits of approximately $100,000 per year from the hormone optimization space. In an environment of expanding patient needs due to an aging population and declining reimbursement for patient care related costs, extending quality of care while providing a profitable revenue stream are compelling contributors to practitioners joining the Biote network.
 Size compared to competition and brand awareness among practitioners—With more than 3,600 clinics, 6,400 Biote-certified practitioners and 3 million procedures performed to date, and over 400,000 active patients, we believe we are approximately 11 times larger than our nearest competitor. We believe that our patient education materials reinforce the commitment by our Biote-certified practitioners to be medically and technically well-prepared to effectively address patients’ symptoms by providing individualized treatment to help patients “achieve their best self”. We believe that Biote-certified practitioners identify with the Biote brand because we provide a reliable education and business platform and enable them to build a profitable practice area.
 Complementary product lines augment growth—In addition to our practice building business, our growth opportunities are also driven by our Biote-branded dietary supplement products. These Biote-branded dietary supplements support consumer health with differentiated formulations. Biote-branded dietary supplements are contract manufactured to approved specifications by a select group of experienced supplement manufacturers. These supplements are primarily sold by Biote-certified practitioners as well as on a direct-to-consumer basis, extending their consumer appeal beyond the HRT patient base.
 Proven leadership team with expansive industry experience—We have a highly experienced leadership team comprised of senior corporate leaders from within global healthcare and consumer markets. Our team has demonstrated skill in scaling our business model to-date. We believe we possess the skills and knowledge to complete our national expansion and capitalize on the growing category awareness.
Practitioner Growth, Sales, Brand and Marketing
 Clinic and Practitioner Growth
 As of December 2022, we contract with over 6,400 Biote-certified practitioners in approximately 3,600 partnered clinics, and many Biote-certified practitioners are also patients. In 2022, we contracted with 740 new partnered clinics, bringing the total number of partnered clinics to 3,600. The 740 new partnered clinics account for 27% of our 2022 revenue growth. Since we started in 2012, our commercial footprint has expanded to 10 core states, which, as of December 2022, generated 64% of our revenue:

• Alabama• Arkansas•Colorado• Florida•Georgia | •Louisiana•Mississippi• New Mexico• Oklahoma•Texas

 We employ targeted methodologies that consider practice demographics and practitioner prescribing history to identify the best potential practitioners within each area of medical specialty and geography. We also utilize these analytics in determining optimal geographies for new sales territories. Although there are approximately 1.2 million total providers in the United States, we target practitioners who are already prescribing alternative HRT patient care-related and having conversations with patients about hormone-related symptoms that impact patient health and wellbeing. This target set includes practitioners in OB/GYN, family and general practice, urology, and internal medicine. In our experience, patients most often seek out practitioners within these distinct specialties when experiencing menopause or andropause symptoms. In 2019, there were approximately 260,000 practitioners in the United States within our targeted specialties. Of this group, we currently target the top three deciles from the relevant specialties, which represents approximately 78,000 practitioners. Practitioners in these four specialties have appropriate patient demographics and have proven they can be developed into capable hormone optimization practices. Our own business experience confirms that more than half of our revenue in 2021 was generated from two provider specialties: family and general practice and OB/GYN.
 We believe medical practitioners choose our company for three primary reasons: 1) our intensive, onsite and virtual education and training, and ongoing mentorship, is unique and highly valued; 2) our proprietary, end-to-end business platform enables efficient practice start-up and management; and 3) through the Biote cash pay model, the average Biote-partnered clinic generates meaningful incremental, comparatively high margin profit to their legacy profitability. Our all-cash, minimal reimbursement model is cost-effective for patients across income levels while delivering strong profits to our partnered clinics. As of 2019, 50% of Biote-certified practitioners’ patients had an annual household income of less than $100,000. We believe this demonstrates the affordability of the procedures and their accessibility to patients of varying income levels, and the scale of the addressable consumer market.
 We derive the majority of our revenue through service fees that encompass the comprehensive platform and wraparound support we provide our Biote-partnered clinics. These service fees are realized when Biote-certified practitioners perform HRT procedures utilizing pellets dispensed in office. During the year ended December 31, 2022, these service fees generated approximately 80% of our revenue.
 This procedure-based revenue model provides our Biote-certified practitioners with consistency and predictability and is not dependent on the volume of bioidentical hormone pellets ordered by practitioners or the number of patients that may visit a clinic. Although there is a correlation between our revenue model and the hormone optimization procedure involving the use of bioidentical hormone pellets, the fees that we charge our Biote-partnered clinics are designed to cover the wide array of education, training, re-training, comprehensive administrative services and support and pass-through cost of pellets that practitioners may prescribe as part of the Biote Method.
 Sales
 Our company began in Texas in 2012 and, since that time, has expanded into the geographically adjacent states. As of December 2022, we have an over 120-person sales force, structured to attract new Biote-certified practitioners while simultaneously supporting the productivity within existing partnered clinics. As of December 2022, the regional sales team consists of 97 liaisons and practice development managers (“PDMs”) and are led locally by a regional manager. Liaisons are charged with identifying non-Biote-certified practitioners and educating them on value in attending the comprehensive two-day training program to become a Biote-certified practitioner. The role of the PDM is to act as a resource and facilitate the practice management of the Biote Method in both new and existing partnered clinics.
 Throughout the initial years of our rapid growth, high practitioner and patient satisfaction made referrals from satisfied practitioners and patients one of our most important marketing tools. Many patients of Biote-certified practitioners or Biote-partnered clinics share their experiences with friends, family, and other practitioners. Biote-certified practitioners often report the positive clinical results and powerful patient descriptions of their hormone optimization experience.

Brand
 The Biote brand has been cultivated over 11 years to reinforce a “science-based, patient focused” approach to our practice building model. We believe that the quality of our platform, our size and scale differential, combined with strong brand placement throughout point-of-care delivery has enabled us to establish Biote as a highly recognized brand in the hormone optimization space. By the end of 2022, more than 3 million patient procedures had been performed by Biote-certified practitioners. We believe the patient experiences generated through the Biote Method are both strong and unique in our competitive environment.
 For practitioners, we believe that those who choose to engage with Biote understand that we offer them a practice-building platform that is highly refined and delivers the critical elements necessary to build a successful hormone optimization practice. Each facet of the Biote Method’s end-to-end platform reinforces our commitment to developing practitioner excellence. Biote-certified practitioners thus understand the value of operating their practice under the Biote brand and are highly loyal.
 For patients visiting a Biote-certified practitioner, our brand represents an opportunity for them to be the “best version of themselves”. Patients can be confident that their Biote-certified practitioner will have a keen, informed focus on their unique symptoms and provide top notch medical care accordingly. Patients see the Biote logo and imagery at every step along the way, from the practitioner’s website to the decal on the door.
 We believe that the acceptance and strength of the Biote brand has enabled us to successfully launch and build our companion Biote-branded dietary supplement line. Practitioners frequently prescribe supplements as adjunct to hormone therapy. As of December 2022, approximately 77% of Biote-partnered clinics also sell Biote-branded dietary supplement products. As patients trust the recommendations of their practitioner, our Biote-branded dietary supplements are likewise trusted and purchased. As a company, we benefit from this continued brand leverage.
 Marketing
 Clinic / Practitioner Marketing
 Our primary objective in marketing to healthcare providers is to inform them of the value in becoming a Biote-certified practitioner. We accomplish this through referrals from existing Biote-certified practitioners to their healthcare provider relationships, a dedicated sales force, and through digital and traditional marketing channels. We target specific healthcare providers based on their specialty, prescribing data, demographic information and location match with our existing geographic footprint and targeted new geographic markets.
 In 2019, there were 260,000 practitioners in the United States within our targeted specialties: family and general practice (108,000); obstetricians and gynecologists (39,000); internal medicine (104,000); and urologists (9,000). These are the specialties that patients typically initially contact when experiencing the symptoms associated with menopause and andropause. As a result, these practitioners are actively searching for a therapeutic solution to the health challenges faced by their existing patients. Currently, approximately 70% of our customer base is comprised of OB/GYN, family and general practice, urology and internal medicine practices. We believe this target mix accurately reflects our potential by specialty, and we expect similar trends moving forward. As such, our practitioner-focused marketing efforts are directed accordingly.
 Lead generation through sales force efforts remains our highest priority channel. To that end, we plan to meaningfully expand the number of sales representatives calling on practitioners within targeted specialties in both current and new geographies. From a central marketing perspective, we have carefully built comprehensive omnichannel expertise and leverage evidence- based content to drive differentiated Biote branding. All tactical execution of marketing and promotion is handled internally. We have invested significantly in building our digital marketing capabilities, we are utilizing this extensive capability to generate practitioner leads and have established media capabilities across all digital channels. We believe the scale and breadth of our marketing capabilities to be a significant competitive advantage that will be very difficult to duplicate.
 Consumer Marketing
 Consumer outreach is a growing portion of our marketing. We believe that the Biote brand is highly differentiated and leverageable across key consumer channels. We direct consumers that are actively seeking care to Biote-certified practitioners via the “Find A Provider” feature on our company website. Through our growing digital outreach capabilities, we connect with consumers seeking general information to Biote-certified practitioners for more information. This not only builds incremental patient starts, but also extends strong practitioner loyalty to our company.
Our Corporate Growth Strategy
 U.S. Geographic Expansion
 Since our initial founding in Texas, we have demonstrated a strong ability to scale. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we conducted over 64% of our business in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Florida. Informed by both data and our past success, we are confident in our ability to further expand our U.S. geographic footprint. For example, in 2022, we grew the size of our sales force by approximately 50% to over 120 customer-facing representatives. In 2023, we plan to expand our field sales and support staff to add liaisons in critical locations, add new geographies
and expand our training capacity to meet the increased rate of new Biote-partnered clinics. In order to efficiently identify new growth opportunities, we use demographic and practitioner-level data such as identifying prescription patterns and prescription purchasing data to assist in understanding the needs of new practices.
International Scale-up
 The market for private-label dietary supplement products, and the training and support requirements for practitioners outside of the United States is well-established and growing. According to the Mater Data Forecast’s “Global Hormone Replacement Therapy Market Size, Share, Trends, COVID-19 Impact & Growth Analysis Report-Segmented By Type, Route of Administration & Region-Industry Forecast (2022 to 2027),” as of April 2021, 57% of the current global market for hormone products exists outside of North America. We believe there is a significant potential opportunity for our practice building platform in a core group of Latin American countries, in Europe and potentially in Asia, which some market analysts project to be the fastest growing market globally. We believe market acceptance is well established in these geographies and targeted population demographics are favorable. We believe this will allow our streamlined tools and education to find a market in these regions.
 We believe that international expansion may require a different access model, such as a license model, which may require the utilization of one or more local distributors with established practitioner relationships. We are in the process of evaluating international expansion on a market-by-market basis with the intention to determine the most appropriate go-to-market strategy and to enter select international market entries in 2023.

 We recognize the challenges and potential risk associated with simultaneously expanding in multiple geographies. As such, our U.S. growth strategy is the most strategically and financially vital. Ensuring that the US plan is on-track and moving toward success will be our primary focus prior to launching international expansion.
 Our current presence outside of the continental United States is in Puerto Rico, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic where we enjoy a fast growing but still nascent business.
 Clinical Research Support
 The clinical research program supports our education programs through systematic literature reviews and analysis of patient therapy effects in clinical practice. By leveraging existing literature and existing data, we will strengthen our educational programs.
 In 2021, we published a nine-year retrospective breast cancer study in the European Journal of Breast Health. This study demonstrated testosterone is breast protective. Testosterone and/or testosterone/estradiol delivered subcutaneously significantly reduced the incidence of breast cancer. Additionally, in 2021, we published a safety review of seven years of adverse events data regarding the use of subcutaneous hormone therapy. This study showed an overall complication rate of less than 1%.
 In 2022, we made significant strides in understanding hormone replacement therapy for women, specifically testosterone therapy, as highlighted in a comprehensive literature review published in the Journal of Personalized Medicine titled “A Personal Perspective on Testosterone Therapy in Women–What We Know in 2022.” This review clarified the lack of scientific evidence for the safety concerns surrounding testosterone therapy in women, paving the way for further research and potential FDA-approved therapies.
 Moreover, a supportive commentary titled “Testosterone Therapy in Women: A Clinical Challenge” published in Obstetrics and Gynecology in 2022 reinforced the benefits of subcutaneously administered testosterone in appropriately selected women to treat menopausal symptoms. This commentary emphasized the need to overcome the negative narratives and focus on the potential positive impact of testosterone therapy for women's health.
 This and other peer-reviewed medical literature has the strongest influence on defining the proper suggestions for clinical practice when focused on the data from controlled clinical trials.
 In parallel, we are engaging with clinical practices to define how to access, analyze and publish their clinical findings. Over the past decade, the FDA and academic communities have targeted real-world evidence as critical to understanding the effects of therapy
and process in clinical practice, a trend that we can utilize to teach Biote-certified practitioners about optimal use of hormone therapies.
 New Product Development
 We are committed to advancing healthcare through product improvement. We constantly evaluate the potential for advanced education and tools to support the hormone optimization market.
 Our Biote-branded dietary supplement business has grown at a 22% CAGR between 2019 and 2022. In addition to generating continued growth through new patients added via our geographic expansion and through direct-to-consumer channels, we believe there is an important growth opportunity to expand the size of our Biote-branded dietary supplement portfolio through new product launches and increased education of Biote-certified practitioners on these products.
Strategic Acquisitions and Product Offerings
 We have historically reinvested our revenue to fund our geographic expansion. Over the next three years, we plan to accelerate that expansion to grow our practice-building business in the hormone optimization market.
 We also believe that by becoming a public company, the resources and access to public markets will provide us with the financial leverage to become strategically acquisitive. We currently evaluate selective business development opportunities as they present themselves, while simultaneously strategizing on moves that we believe could benefit our model and our stockholders.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 186 employees, across 11 departments. This includes five employees on the executive team, 136 in sales and marketing, and seven in finance and operations. We believe our employee relations are good. None of our employees work under any collective bargaining agreements. All of our employment and consulting agreements include employees’ and consultants’ covenants with respect to confidentiality, noncompetition, nonsolicitation and assignment to us of intellectual property rights developed in the course of their employment with us. However, there can be no assurance that these agreements will be enforceable or that they will provide us with adequate protection.
 We are committed to creating, nurturing and sustaining an inclusive culture where differences drive innovative solutions to meet the needs of our practitioners and partnered clinics, their patients, and our employees. We believe that having varied perspectives helps generate better ideas to solve the complex healthcare problems of a changing-and increasingly diverse-world. A diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce is a critical focus of the Company.
 Organizationally, we are progressing our diversity recruiting and advancement goals by:
 •Targeting diverse job boards that market to diverse candidate pools
 •Targeting networking/user groups that are diverse in nature
 •Developing an employer brand that conveys our diversity, equality and inclusion commitment and initiatives
 •Creating and continually improving company policies that appeal to diverse candidates
 •Offering future talent acquisition recruiters the opportunity to attend and complete a thorough diversity certification course
 •Nurturing a respectful and encouraging workplace
 •Providing professional development assessments and opportunities to support skill and career growth
 These initiatives represent the next steps in our diversity, equity and inclusion commitments. With time and consistent focus, we are building a truly inclusive and equitable workplace.
 Supply Chain for Dietary Supplements and Pellet Insertion Kits
 Our supply chain management enables precise planning of near-term and long-term business growth because we have full visibility into the production and distribution of resources that influence capacity planning. We sell 18 custom-branded dietary supplements, manufactured to exacting specifications by six U.S.-based suppliers. Currently, no one supplier manufactures more than seven products within our portfolio. We have chosen and continually evaluate our dietary supplement suppliers based on multiple factors including: 1) reputation and experience in the dietary supplement space; 2) expertise they bring to a specific product category; 3) ability to consistently execute all aspects of the manufacturing and packaging process to Biote quality standards; 4) on-time order fulfillment; and 5) cost.
 We strive for supplier consistency within our supply chain. However, we do not hesitate to change or add new suppliers when there is potential to either improve our dietary supplement product offerings or gain operational leverage through better cost position and/or supplier service levels. We aim to maintain rigid quality control standards, ensuring the products and services of every dietary supplement and ingredient supplier and vendor meet or exceed our expectations. While all dietary supplement products are currently
single source manufactured, we have identified potential back-up suppliers for contingency situations, should they arise. While no single dietary supplement product is sufficiently large enough to justify dual source of supply, we regularly evaluate this decision from a risk management perspective and will add second source dietary supplement suppliers when appropriate.
 Our Biote-branded dietary supplement inventory and shipping are executed by a 3PL partner. Our current structure is with B2B as our 3PL ships Biote-branded dietary supplements directly to Biote-certified practitioners, who in turn, sell directly to patients. As our business scales, we envision that our dietary supplement distribution mix will also evolve. We expect to add more Biote-certified practitioners and that a growing percentage of our dietary supplement sales will be direct-to-consumer. We anticipate this will result in fulfillment shifting to a much greater volume of more frequent, smaller orders—directly to patients. While these shifts will occur over time, we are currently planning for the necessary changes to our 3PL structure, including adding one or more shipping locations, to successfully manage this expansion.
 We also offer for sale to practitioners two sterile pellet insertion kits for use with hormone optimization therapies, one for male patients and one for female patients. These kits largely contain commercially available products, including disposable supplies (gloves, antiseptic, gauze, disposable trocar, etc.) assembled in a sterile package. The products contained in the kits are sourced, assembled, and supplied by a third-party with whom we have an agreement. Sales of these products are modest as most clinics currently choose to assemble these parts in-house.
 Administering hormone therapy via subcutaneous placement of hormone pellets is a procedure performed by health care providers in the office. Once the patient’s individualized dose is established, a local anesthetic is applied to the upper buttock or flank. A small incision (about 3-4mm in length) is made and the pellets (about the size of a grain of rice) are inserted into the subcutaneous fat using a-trocar insertion device. Upon placement of the pellets and removal of the trocar insertion device, wound closure tape is placed over the incision. A protective dressing is then placed over the wound closure tape. Experienced practitioners typically complete the pellet insertion process in four to seven minutes, depending on the number of pellets inserted.
 Biote-certified practitioners utilize a wide variety of hormone therapies. In addition to bioidentical hormone pellets, practitioners may also choose to administer hormone therapy to their patients via topical methods (creams, gels, patches), oral methods (sublingual tablets, pills), or injections depending on the practitioners’ medical assessment of their patients’ clinical needs.
 In a 2014 study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, pellet therapy was chosen by 17% of 382 male patients when presented with the choice of the following methods of hormone therapy: gels, injections, and implantable subcutaneous pellets. Further, according to a 2013 study published in the same journal, of 113 men who underwent a subcutaneous testosterone pellets therapy, 52.5% had switched to subcutaneous pellet therapy from topical gel therapy and 35.4% had switched from injection therapy.
 We manage and monitor our supply chain, in part, via a Sales and Operations Planning Process (“S&OP”). This has a goal of continually iterating a capital-efficient supply chain that underpins practitioners’ confidence in providing care for their patients. This process collects inputs from the following as part of our direct responsibility for planning and sourcing:
 •Feedback from dietary supplement suppliers we talk to regularly regarding inventory availability and fulfillment performance
 •Sales and finance teams that monitor sales volumes, and develop product pricing structures
 •Marketing teams that monitor sales and inventory metrics, developing promotional events to optimize revenue and inventory investment
 •New dietary supplement product development teams that create new offerings to bring to market, based on industry trends and customer needs
 These and other inputs are reconciled monthly as part of the S&OP process to ensure that expected market demand, product forecasts, orders and dietary supplement production delivery are tightly aligned across all involved functions, including sales, marketing, finance and operations. This process helps ensure that product inventories are managed to appropriate levels, simultaneously enabling targeted customer service levels and optimized inventory costs.
 Our Biote-branded dietary supplement supply chain has remained highly stable over the past two years. As a preventative measure due to global supply chain disruptions, we increased our safety stock (minimum required inventory on hand) from three weeks to four weeks. For the foreseeable future, we will continue to monitor the marketplace and assess potential dietary supplement supply chain changes and alter our strategy accordingly.
 Intellectual Property
 We develop and continue to refine our CDS and proprietary formulations for our Biote-branded dietary supplements. We believe the completeness of our offerings represents a sustainable competitive advantage and is but one contributing factor to our high rate of practice retention. While their existence is not a trade secret, their details, as well as the investment and practice experience required by a competitor to reproduce them represents a barrier of entry in that respect.
Patents
 As of December 31, 2022, we owned three issued U.S. design patents related to trocars. The first filed of these three patents, D773,664, is subject to a 14-year term and will expire on December 6, 2030. The remaining two patents, D791,322 and D800,307, are subject to a 15-year term and will expire on July 4, 2032, and October 17, 2032, respectively. We pursued these patents to protect the unique design qualities of the trocars recommended for use in our education and training. However, we are no longer using our design patents as specifications for trocar manufacturing, opting instead to purchase and market trocar convenience kits that include commercially available and sourced disposable trocars.
Trademarks
 As of December 31, 2022, our trademark portfolio comprises 24 trademark registrations or active trademark applications worldwide. Such portfolio includes nine U.S. trademark registrations, 11 non-U.S. trademark registrations, three pending non-U.S. trademark applications and one pending U.S. trademark applications.
Trade Secrets
 In addition to our reliance on trademark protection for our brand and tradename, we also rely on trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality agreements and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. New employee hires, as well as vendors and consultants, are required to sign contractual agreements to protect our confidential information from disclosure. We take various physical security and cybersecurity measures, including having policies in place to prevent data breaches and help prevent our confidential information from being transferred to unsecured systems.
Competition
 Although we have competitors, we believe that no current competitor has the strength and size of our practice-building business within the hormone optimization space. We believe our company is significantly larger than our next competitors in a highly fragmented space. The below chart details our principal competitors’ offerings compared to Biote (based on publicly available information):

Company Name | Biote | Evexipel | Sottopelle | BodyLogicMD | Pellecome | HTCA | Pro-pell 
Number of Practice’s Locations | 3,600 | 300 | 150 | 45 | 100 | 120 | 150 
Geographic Area | North America | U.S. | U.S. South America | 28 States | Most U.S. States | MostU.S. States | 29 States 
Services Provided | BHRT Education, Training, and Inventory Management | Pellet Therapy Education | Pellet Therapy Education | BHRT Modalities and Wellness Program Franchise | Pellet Training, Pellet Insertion Devices | Pellet Therapy Education | Pellet Training, Compounding Pharmacy Items
Products Sold | Training Classes, Dietary Supplements & Convenience | Training Classes, Dietary Supplements & Convenience Kits | Training Classes & Pellets | Memberships to Provider offices | Training Classes, Dietary Supplements & Convenience Kits | Training Classes | Training, Pellets, Supplements 

 The dietary supplement space is a large, fragmented and highly competitive industry, with few barriers to entry for both branded dietary supplements sold through practitioners as well as direct to consumer online and through conventional retailers and department stores. For instance, of our competitors listed above, Evexipel, Pellecome, and Pro-Pell maintain their own branded dietary supplements that they sell through affiliated practitioners and Sottopelle, BodyLogicMD and HTCA sell their branded dietary supplements direct to consumers online. Further, an internet search for providers of DIM, a popular dietary supplement, illustrates more than 20 other accessible brands, including Nature’s Way and The Vitamin Shoppe, available online and sold through conventional retailers and department stores such as The Vitamin Shoppe, Walmart, and Target.
 Despite the significant availability of dietary supplements, the contents of different brands vary substantially leaving to the consumers to ensure that their purchase matches their physiologic needs. In contrast to other competitors, our Biote-branded dietary supplements are primarily sold and recommended by Biote-certified practitioners. As of December 2022, approximately 77% of Biote-partnered clinics also sell Biote-branded dietary supplement products. We believe consumers primarily choose our Biote-branded dietary supplements as they are recommended by their practitioner.
 Government Regulations/Healthcare Laws
 Government Regulation
 Our business is the development and instruction in the Biote Method to practitioners who then become certified in the Biote Method. We offer training courses in our Biote Method and access to a network of other providers who have been trained in the Biote Method. The Biote Method involves educating and training medical providers in the analysis of patient hormone wellness. The Biote-certified practitioner will use both our proprietary user platform and his or her own independent medical judgment to assess patient wellness and make recommendations to improve wellness. This assessment may result in the Biote-certified practitioner’s prescription for drugs, including compounded bioidentical hormones and/or recommendation of dietary supplements.

The healthcare industry in the United States is subject to extensive regulation by a number of governmental entities at the federal, state and local level. The healthcare regulatory landscape is also subject to frequent change. Laws and regulations in the healthcare industry are extremely complex and, in many instances, the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation. Moreover, our business is impacted not only by those laws and regulations that are directly applicable to us but also by certain laws and regulations that are applicable to vendors, medical providers, outsourcing facilities and traditional compounding pharmacies. While our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with all of the existing laws and regulations applicable to us as stated below, such laws and regulations are subject to rapid change and often are uncertain and inconsistent in their application. As controversies continue to arise in the healthcare industry, federal and state regulation and enforcement priorities in this area may increase, the impact of which cannot be predicted. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to scrutiny or challenge under one or more of these laws or that any such challenge would not be successful. Any such challenge, whether or not successful, could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations.
 Among the various federal and state laws and regulations which may govern or impact our current and planned operations are the following:
 Regulation of Dietary Supplements
 Biote-certified practitioners who are trained in the Biote Method may recommend dietary supplements. We are a private-labeler of dietary supplements.
 Under the FDCA, “dietary supplements” are defined as vitamins, minerals, herbs, other botanicals, amino acids and other dietary substances that are used to supplement the diet, as well as concentrates, constituents, extracts, metabolites, or combinations of such dietary ingredients. The FDCA and its amendments, such as the Food Safety Modernization Act and the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (the “DSHEA”), provide the FDA with the authority to regulate dietary supplements and the dietary ingredients in the supplement products and ensure that they comply with the requirements for identity, purity, quality, strength, and composition. The FDA has the authority to regulate the entire lifecycle of a dietary supplement product, and regulates the formulation, development, manufacture, packaging, labeling, holding, promotion, sale, and distribution of dietary supplements. Under the FDCA, introduction into interstate commerce of misbranded, adulterated, or otherwise unlawful FDA-regulated products is prohibited. Violations such as non-compliance with the FDA labeling requirements, false or misleading statements on a product’s labeling, or non-compliant nutrient declarations can render a product misbranded. In addition, violations such as inclusion of prohibited or dangerous ingredients, production in facilities that do not comply with the current good manufacturing processes (“cGMP”) requirements, or production under insanitary conditions can render a product adulterated.
 In addition, a dietary supplement product can become adulterated if it includes a new dietary ingredient and the product does not comply with the requirements for new dietary ingredients. A new dietary ingredient is a dietary ingredient that was not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994. Under the DSHEA, manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements containing new dietary ingredients must submit a new dietary ingredient notification, unless the ingredient has been present in the food supply as an article used for food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered. A new dietary ingredient notification must provide the FDA with evidence of a “history of use or other evidence of safety” that establishes that use of the dietary ingredient “will reasonably be expected to be safe.” A new dietary ingredient notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the new dietary ingredient can be marketed. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept evidence purporting to establish the safety of any new dietary ingredients that we may want to market, and the FDA’s refusal to accept such evidence could prevent the marketing of such dietary ingredients. In addition, there is no definitive list of dietary ingredients that are exempt from the new dietary ingredient notification requirement. There is no guarantee that the FDA will agree with us that all of our dietary ingredients comply with this requirement.
 In determining whether a product should be regulated as a dietary supplement, the FDA reviews the objective intent of a product’s manufacturer and/or distributor, as evidenced by the manufacturer and/or distributor’s expressed or implied labeling claims, advertising matter, and oral and written statements, to determine the product’s classification. The FDA may classify a product as a drug, food, or supplement depending on the objective intent. For example, claims to cure diseases can render a product a drug that is subject to FDA’s drug requirements, such as the requirement to submit to the FDA a new drug application prior to marketing the product. However, certain “health claims,” which are claims that have been reviewed and approved by the FDA associating a nutrient with risk-reduction, but not treatment, of a disease or health-related condition may be included on dietary supplement product’s labeling. In addition, “statements of nutritional support,” including so-called “structure/function claims,” can be included in labeling without the FDA’s review of the statement. Such statements may describe how a particular dietary ingredient affects the structure, function or general well-being of the body, or the mechanism of action by which a dietary ingredient may affect the structure, function or well-being of the body, but such statements may not claim that a dietary supplement will reduce the risk or incidence of a disease unless such claim has been reviewed and approved by the FDA. A company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess evidence–at the time that the statement is made–substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. Such statements must be submitted to the FDA no later than thirty days after first marketing the product with the certification that the company possesses the necessary evidence and must be accompanied by an FDA-mandated label disclaimer tied to the statement, indicating that “This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.” There is no assurance, however, that the FDA will agree with our positions on these matters, and it may interpret a claim as
an unauthorized health claim, in which case we may not be able to use the claim for our products, and we may be subject to enforcement actions stemming from the claims that render a dietary supplement misbranded or cause a product to become an unapproved new drug under the FDCA.
 As authorized by the FDCA, the FDA has adopted and implemented cGMPs, specifically for dietary supplements. These cGMPs impose extensive process controls on the manufacture, holding, labeling, packaging, and distribution of dietary supplements and the components of dietary supplements. They require that every dietary supplement be made in accordance with a master manufacturing record with all dietary ingredients verified by identity testing before use; that each step in manufacture, holding, labeling, packaging, and distribution be defined with written standard operating procedures, monitored, and documented; and that any deviation in manufacture, holding, labeling, packaging, or distribution be contemporaneously documented, assessed by a quality-control expert, and corrected through documented corrective action steps (whether through an intervention that restores the product to the specifications in the master manufacturing record or to document destruction of the non-conforming product). The cGMPs are designed to ensure documentation, including testing results that confirm the identity, purity, quality, strength, and composition of finished dietary supplements. In addition, cGMPs require a company to make and keep written records of every product complaint that is related to cGMPs. The regulations directly affect all who manufacture the dietary supplements that we sell and our distribution of dietary supplements. The FDA may deem any dietary supplement adulterated, whether presenting a risk of illness or injury or not, based on a failure to comply with any one or more process controls in the cGMP regulations. If deemed adulterated, a dietary supplement may not be lawfully distributed and may have to be recalled from the market. It is possible that the FDA will find one or more of the process controls for our products to be inadequate and may require corrective action, may render any one or more of the dietary supplements we sell unlawful for sale, or may result in a judicial order that may impair our ability to market and sell dietary supplements.
 The FDA also requires product labels to include phone numbers or addresses for reporting of adverse events, and requires serious adverse event reporting for all supplements. An “adverse event” is defined by statute to include “any health-related event associated with the use of a dietary supplement that is adverse.” While all adverse event complaints received must be recorded in accordance with the cGMPs discussed above, only serious adverse events must be reported to the FDA. A “serious adverse event” is an adverse event that: results in death, a life-threatening experience, inpatient hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or requires, based on reasonable medical judgment, a medical or surgical intervention to prevent an outcome described above. When a manufacturer, packer, or distributor whose name appears on the product label of a dietary supplement receives any report of a serious adverse event associated with the use of the dietary supplement in the United States, the company must submit a “serious adverse event report” on MedWatch Form 3500A. The report must be filed within 15 business days of receipt of information regarding the adverse event. All adverse event reports, whether serious or not, must be recorded and kept in company records under the cGMP rules. A company must maintain records of each report of any adverse event (both serious and non-serious) for a minimum of 6 years. These records should include any documents related to the report, including: the company’s serious adverse event report to the FDA with attachments; any new medical information about the serious adverse event received; all reports to the FDA of new medical information related to the serious adverse event; and any communications between the company and any other person(s) who provided information related to the adverse event.
 Under the FDCA, the FDA also has the authority to inspect facilities that manufacture, process, pack, hold, or otherwise further the introduction of dietary supplement products into interstate commerce. The FDA typically reviews the facilities and the products that are manufactured, processed, packed, or held in those facilities for compliance with the requirements under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. If the FDA finds non-compliance during the inspection, the FDA may issue a Form 483 Notice of Inspectional Observations that lists and explains the deficiencies that the FDA identified during the inspection. Facilities then must implement corrective actions and provide responses to the FDA; if the FDA finds the corrective actions and responses to be satisfactory, the FDA will close out the inspection. Non-compliance with any of the FDA requirements under the FDCA can result in enforcement actions, including civil and criminal penalties. The FDA may send warning letters, untitled letters, or it-has-come-to-our-attention letters, make public announcements about illegal products, require mandatory or recommend voluntary recalls, or it may place the violative company and its products on the Import Alert, thereby stopping all applicable incoming shipments. For more serious or repeat violations, the FDA may seek more drastic remedies such as seizures, disgorgement, or injunctions. Criminal violations can result in fines or incarceration. Enforcement actions from the FDA can severely interfere with a company’s ability to conduct its business and can also negatively impact the company’s ability to operate in the future.
 The FTC requires advertising for any product, including dietary supplements, to be truthful, not misleading, and properly substantiated. For advertisements relating to dietary supplements, the FDA typically requires a substantiation standard of competent and reliable scientific evidence for all express and implied claims. The FTC has promulgated policies and guidance that apply to advertising for food and dietary supplements. Advertisers must possess adequate substantiation for the product claims before disseminating advertisements. The FTC also regulates other aspects of consumer purchases including, but not limited to, promotional offers, telemarketing, continuity plans, and “free” offers. The FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for making false or misleading advertising claims and for failing to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising. These enforcement actions have often resulted in warning letters, consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties and/or restitution by the companies involved. Should the FTC determine that our claims are false or misleading or unsubstantiated, we could be subject to FTC enforcement action.

Our business is also subject to regulation under various state and local laws that include provisions governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of dietary supplements. For example, under Proposition 65 in the State of California, there is a list of substances that are deemed to pose a risk of carcinogenicity or birth defects at or above certain levels. If any such ingredient exceeds the permissible levels in a dietary supplement, cosmetic, or drug, the product may be lawfully sold in California only if accompanied by a prominent warning label alerting consumers that the product contains an ingredient linked to cancer or birth-defect risk. Private actions as well as California attorney general actions may be brought against non-compliant parties and can result in substantial costs and fines. In addition, there are state consumer protection statutes that allow consumers to bring lawsuits against marketers of FDA-regulated products. For example, California has a law called the “Consumers Legal Remedies Act” (Cal. Civ. Code § 1750 et seq.) that allows private parties to assert a class action claim for false or deceptive advertising. It is typically asserted in combination with claims for false advertising and unfair competition under the California Business and Professions Code. California law firms specializing in this type of consumer class action claims have recently been targeting dietary supplement and OTC homeopathic drug makers and sellers of products sold in California, claiming injury based on the products’ failure to deliver results as claimed in product labeling and promotion. Many other states, such as New York and Illinois, have similar laws and we may become the subject of lawsuits filed under such laws, which tend to be plaintiff-friendly.
 Congress continues to enact new laws or amend the existing laws that are applicable to some of our business. From time to time in the future, we may become subject to additional laws or regulations administered by the FDA; the FTC; or by other federal, state, or local regulatory authorities; to the repeal of laws or regulations, or to more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations. We are not able to predict the nature of such future laws, regulations, repeals or interpretations, and we cannot predict what effect additional governmental regulation, if and when it occurs, would have on our business in the future. Such developments could, however, require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of certain products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, additional personnel or other new requirements. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that, if more stringent statutes are enacted for dietary supplements, or if more stringent regulations are promulgated, we will be able to comply with such statutes or regulations or that compliance won’t first require us to incur substantial expense.
 Regulation of Compounded Drug Products
 Section 503B Outsourcing Facilities
 Biote-certified practitioners who are trained in the Biote Method may prescribe bioidentical compounded hormone pellets prepared by independent third-party compounding pharmacies, known as outsourcing facilities. Outsourcing facilities must be registered with the FDA under Section 503B of the FDCA. Outsourcing facilities are primarily regulated by Section 503B, however, outsourcing facilities may also be subject to state statutes and regulations governing the practice of pharmacy, and the Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”) and corresponding state-controlled substance regulations, as applicable.
 Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act. Under Section 503B of the FDCA, outsourcing facilities are permitted to compound large quantities of drug formulations pursuant to a practitioner’s order, and to distribute drug formulations without a patient-specific prescription for office administration or for the purpose of dispensing. Section 503B includes requirements regarding registration and reporting, use of bulk drug substances, a prohibition on wholesaling and compounding copies of FDA-approved drugs, and certain requirements for labeling, among others. Entities registering as outsourcing facilities are subject to cGMP requirements and regular FDA inspections, among other requirements. FDA has issued a series of draft and final guidance which further explain FDA’s positions on the requirements of certain portions of Section 503B.
 Drugs compounded by outsourcing facilities in compliance with Section 503B are exempt from the new drug approval requirements of the FDCA and certain labeling requirements. This means that FDA does not verify the safety or effectiveness of compounded products distributed by outsourcing facilities; rather Section 503B of the FDCA establishes standards for manufacturing processes and controls to ensure drug quality applicable to outsourcing facilities. Drugs compounded by outsourcing facilities also lack an FDA finding of manufacturing quality before such drugs are marketed. Section 503B outsourcing facilities are subject to FDA inspection and are inspected by FDA on a risk-based schedule. Non-compliance with FDA requirements can result in FDA enforcement actions. FDA may send warning letters or untitled letters; make public announcements about illegal products; request recalls; or it may place the violative company and its products on Import Alert, thereby stopping all applicable incoming shipments. For more serious or repeat violations, FDA may seek more drastic remedies such as seizures, disgorgement, injunctions, or prosecution.
 State Regulation. Outsourcing facilities are primarily regulated by the FDCA, however, certain states impose state licensing requirements on outsourcing facilities and may, where applicable, require that such facilities comply with applicable state statutes and regulations governing the preparation of drug products. Depending on the state, outsourcing facilities may be subject to further inspection by state regulatory authorities.
 Controlled Substance Act. The CSA regulates the manufacture, importation, possession, use, and distribution of certain substances. These controlled substances are categorized into one of five schedules, and their placement is based upon the substance’s medical use, potential for abuse, and safety or dependence liability. Controlled substances are subject to extensive regulation by the
DEA, as well as state and local regulatory agencies, regarding procurement, manufacture, storage, shipment, sale, and use. These regulations add additional complications and costs to the storage, use, sale and distribution of such products. All pharmacies, including outsourcing facilities, that handle controlled substances must register with DEA and ensure compliance with the CSA as it relates to the controlled substances in the pharmacy’s possession. All pharmacies, including outsourcing facilities, that are registered with DEA are subject to inspection by DEA. Failure to comply with the CSA may result in civil and criminal liabilities.
 Regulation of Medical Devices
 In the United States, FDA defines a medical device as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent or other similar or related article, including any component part or accessory, which is (i) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals, or (ii) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals and which does not achieve any of its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes. Medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, pre-market clearance, authorization or approval, establishment registration and product listing, product manufacturing, product packaging and labeling, product storage, advertising and promotion, product distribution, recalls and field actions, servicing and post-market clinical surveillance. A number of U.S. states also impose licensing and compliance regimes on companies that manufacture or distribute prescription devices into or within the state.
Trocar Convenience Kits
 The FDA classifies medical devices into three classes based on risk. The level of regulatory control increases from Class I (lowest risk), to Class II (moderate risk), to Class III (highest risk). Marketing of most Class II and III medical devices within the United States must be preceded either by (a) pre-market notification and FDA clearance pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FDCA or (b) the granting of pre-market approval (“PMA”). Both 510(k) notifications and PMA applications must be submitted to the FDA with significant user fees, although reduced fees for small businesses are available. Class I devices are generally exempt from pre-market review and notification, as are some moderate-risk Class II devices. Most Class II devices are subject to the requirement to submit a 510(k) notification and receive a clearance for marketing. Manufacturers of all classes of devices must comply with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), establishment registration, medical device listing, labeling requirements, and medical device reporting (“MDR”) regulations, which are collectively referred to as medical device general controls. Class II devices may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, FDA guidelines, or particularized labeling. Some Class I and Class II devices can be exempted by regulation from the requirement of compliance with substantially all of the QSR.
 FDA regulations for medical devices include requirements to (a) register medical devices establishments and (b) list marketed medical devices in the FDA medical device database. We are registered with FDA for our facility as a repackager/relabeler and a specification developer and our Class I disposable and reusable trocars which are included in convenience kits for sale to our customers are listed on FDA’s device database. We currently market only disposable trocar convenience kits. The convenience kits include commercially available and sourced disposable trocar with obdurator and tip protector; a sterile tray; sterile, latex free, CSR wrap; a medicine cup; latex free gloves, a Syringe and needles; alcohol prep pad; chlorhexidine gluconate and isopropyl alcohol skin antiseptic swab stick; compound benzoin tincture vial; a fenestrated drape; gauze dressings; a plastic forceps; a scalpel, tape strips, and transparent dressing. These convenience kits are assembled by Medline Industries, LP, with the components, including the trocars, being manufactured by various other component suppliers.
 A “convenience kit” is defined in 21 CFR 801.3 as “two or more different medical devices packaged together for the convenience of the user.” FDA interprets this to mean a convenience kit is a device that contains two or more different medical devices packaged together and intended to remain packaged together and not to be replaced, substituted, repackaged, sterilized, or otherwise processed or modified before being used by an end user.
 Most medical devices, including the devices within a convenience kit, must undergo pre-market review by and receive clearance, authorization, or approval from the FDA prior to commercialization, unless the device is of a type exempted from such review by statute, regulation, or an FDA exercise of enforcement discretion. However, if a convenience kit falls under enforcement discretion such that it is not required to obtain a premarket clearance, the convenience kit must not modify the intended use(s) of the individual kit components. If the labeling of the kit suggests an intended use for components that differs from the approved uses, the FDA may require premarket review.
 Under FDA’s Convenience Kits Interim Regulatory Guidance, FDA exercises enforcement discretion and thereby does not require premarket clearance for convenience kits, as it is FDA’s current thinking that such clearance may not be necessary to ensure protection of the public health. Accordingly, unless and until there is formal rulemaking on this issue, FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion, i.e. not require 510(k) clearance, for convenience kits if they are consistent with the “Types of Convenience Kits” list. To qualify for the enforcement discretion guidance and not be required to obtain premarket clearance, these kits must consist of components that do not alter the intended use of the individual kit components; only contain components that are legally marketed preamendments devices, exempt from premarket notification, or have been found to be substantially equivalent through
premarket notification process; and where the assembler/manufacturer is able to reasonably conclude that any further processing of the kit and its components does not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of any of its components.
 State Oversight of Convenience Kits
 The distribution of convenience kits is also regulated by certain states, some of which impose state licensure requirements as a resident or nonresident distributor. That is, even if a facility does not handle the physical distribution of the convenience kit, the facility could still be required to obtain a state distributor license if the facility causes the convenience kit to be distributed or furthers the marketing of the convenience kit. We cause the convenience kits to be distributed and further the marketing of the same, therefore, we hold a resident device distributor license with the Texas Department of State Health Services. We also cause the distribution of convenience kits into several other states, some of which require Biote, as a nonresident facility, to hold a nonresident device distributor license. Accordingly, we also hold all applicable and required nonresident distributor licenses.
Clinical Decision Support Software
 As stated above, our proprietary CDS provides Biote-certified practitioners with information from published literature and clinical guidelines to assist practitioners in evaluating patient-specific treatment options.
 FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software functions intended for use in healthcare settings. FDA has the authority to regulate a software function as a medical device if it falls within the definition of a “device” under the FDCA. However, FDA has exercised enforcement discretion for software said to be “low risk.”
 The 21st Century Cures Act clarified FDA’s authority to regulate software functions as medical devices by amending the definition of “device” in the FDCA to exclude certain software functions, including clinical decision support software that meet certain criteria. In December 2017, FDA issued a draft guidance document describing FDA’s proposed interpretation of the exemption under the 21st Century Cures Act for CDS software. FDA issued a revised draft of this CDS software guidance document in September 2019. Under the 21st Century Cures Act and FDA CDS guidance, certain software functions are excluded from FDA’s definition of “device” when they meet all the following criteria:
 1.not intended to acquire, process, or analyze a medical image or a signal from an in vitro diagnostic device or a pattern or signal from a signal acquisition system;
 2.intended for the purpose of displaying, analyzing, or printing medical information about a patient or other medical information (such as peer-reviewed clinical studies and clinical practice guidelines);
 3.intended for the purpose of supporting or providing recommendations to a healthcare professional about prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a disease or condition; and
 4.intended for the purpose of enabling such healthcare professional to independently review the basis for such recommendations that such software presents so that it is not the intent that such healthcare professional rely primarily on any of such recommendations to make a clinical diagnosis or treatment decision regarding an individual patient.
 Although we believe that our technologies and software are not subject to active FDA regulation, there is a risk that the FDA could disagree. There is also a risk that FDA could finalize its guidance for CDS software in such a way that it excludes our software and technologies from the scope of the CDS software exclusion under the 21st Century Cures Act.
 If the FDA determines that any of our current or future services, technologies or software applications, including our CDS software, are regulated by the FDA as medical devices, we would become subject to various statutes, regulations and policies enforced by the FDA and other governmental authorities, including both pre-market and post-market requirements, and we would need to bring the affected services, technologies, and/or software into compliance with such requirements.
 Other Laws
 Regulation of Advertising
 The FTC regulates advertising pursuant to its authority to prevent “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce” under the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTCA”). The FTC will find an advertisement to be deceptive if it contains a representation or omission of fact that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances, and the representation or omission is material and if the advertiser does not possess and rely upon a reasonable basis, such as competent and reliable evidence, substantiating the claim. The FTC may attack unfair or deceptive advertising practices through either an administrative adjudication or judicial enforcement action, including preliminary or permanent injunction. The FTC may also seek consumer redress from the advertiser in instances of dishonest or fraudulent conduct.
 In addition, the FDA regulates the advertising of prescription drugs. Promotional materials for prescription compounded drugs may not be false or misleading. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can result in a prescription drug being deemed misbranded under the FDCA. This can result in administrative or judicial penalties, including civil penalties, injunctions, or in extreme instances, criminal prosecution.

Moreover, states have similar unfair and deceptive acts and practices statutes (sometimes called “little FTC Acts” or “UDAP” statutes). They vary, but often the state regulator can seek monetary relief along with an order of discontinuance. Under certain state UDAP laws, consumers can bring private claims against companies who disseminate false or deceptive advertising claims. Although those UDAP statutes often provide for statutory damages in the case of individual consumers, more often such cases take the form of class actions, which can lead to damages awards and awards of attorney’s fees.
 Finally, federal and state laws also give causes of action to competitors to seek injunctive and monetary relief for false and misleading advertising statements. Any person who is or may be likely to be damaged by false or misleading advertising statements may bring an action in federal court pursuant to the Lanham Act, § 43(a). Proven damages may be trebled and attorney’s fees and costs may be awarded in appropriate cases. There are state analogs of this sort of unfair competition statute as well.
 Corporate Practice of Medicine Laws; Fee Splitting
 We contract with Biote-certified practitioners to provide them with access to our services. These contractual relationships are subject to various state laws that prohibit fee splitting or the practice of a healthcare profession by lay entities or persons that are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing a practitioner’s professional judgment, known as the corporate practice of medicine. Activities other than those directly related to the delivery of healthcare may be considered an element of the practice of medicine in many states. Under the corporate practice of medicine prohibition of certain states, decisions and activities that may be performed by unlicensed individuals or entities and perceived as impacting the clinical decision-making of licensed professionals such as policy and procedure development, contracting, setting rates and the hiring and management of clinical personnel may implicate the restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine. Similarly, certain compensation arrangements between licensed professionals and unlicensed individuals and entities can implicate state fee-splitting prohibitions, which prohibit providers from sharing a portion of their professional fees collected with third parties.
 State corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting laws and rules vary from state to state and are not always consistent across various healthcare professions within the same state. In addition, these requirements are subject to broad interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. Some of these requirements may apply to our business even if we do not have a physical presence in the state, based solely on our relationship with a practitioner licensed in the state. Thus, regulatory authorities or other parties, including Biote-certified practitioners, may assert that we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that our contractual arrangements with Biote-certified practitioners or their practice groups constitute unlawful fee splitting. In such event, failure to comply could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or Biote-certified practitioners, civil, criminal or administrative penalties, receipt of cease-and-desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, the need to make changes to the terms of engagement of our Biote-certified practitioners that interfere with our business, and other materially adverse consequences.
 Licenses and Accreditations
 We, as well as the Biote-certified practitioners, may be subject to professional and private licensing, certification and accreditation requirements. These include, but are not limited to, requirements imposed by Medicare, Medicaid, state licensing authorities, voluntary accrediting organizations and third-party private payors. Receipt and renewal of such licenses, certifications and accreditations are often based on inspections, surveys, audits, investigations or other reviews, some of which may require affirmative compliance actions by us to ensure we are accurately representing our services that could be burdensome and expensive. The applicable standards may change in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain all necessary licenses or certifications in good standing or that they will not be required to incur substantial costs in doing so. The failure to maintain all necessary licenses, certifications and accreditations in good standing, or the expenditure of substantial funds to maintain them, could have an adverse effect on our business.
U.S. State Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
 Many states, including certain states in which we conduct our business, prohibit any person from offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, for the referral of patients or other items or services to or with licensed healthcare providers, subject to limited exceptions. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary by jurisdiction and are enforced by local courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, some apply only to state healthcare program payors, while other state laws apply regardless of payor, including funds paid out of pocket by a patient. A determination of liability under such state fraud and abuse laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce the referral of a patient or the purchase, lease or order (or the arranging for or recommending of the purchase, lease or order) of healthcare items or services paid for by federal healthcare programs, including Medicare or Medicaid. A violation does not require proof that a person had actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate the statute, and court decisions under the Anti-Kickback Statute have consistently held that the law is violated where one purpose of a payment is to induce or reward referrals. Violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute could result in felony conviction, administrative penalties, liability (including
penalties) under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729 (the “False Claims Act”) and/or exclusion from federal healthcare programs. A number of states have enacted anti-kickback laws that sometimes apply not only to state-sponsored healthcare programs, but also to items or services that are paid for by private insurance and self-pay patients. State anti-kickback laws can vary considerably in their applicability and scope and sometimes have fewer statutory and regulatory exceptions than does the federal law. We consider the importance of anti-kickback laws when structuring company operations and relationships. That said, we cannot ensure that the applicable regulatory authorities will not determine that some of our arrangements with physicians violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or other applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject us to different liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other healthcare programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 Under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, a person (including an organization) is prohibited from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented to any United States officer, employee, agent, or department, or any state agency, a claim for payment for medical or other items or services where the person knows or should know (a) the items or services were not provided as described in the coding of the claim, (b) the claim is a false or fraudulent claim, (c) the claim is for a service furnished by an unlicensed physician, (d) the claim is for medical or other items or service furnished by a person or an entity that is in a period of exclusion from the program, or (e) the items or services are medically unnecessary items or services. Penalties range from $20,000 to $100,000 per violation up to $20,000 per claim, treble damages, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. The Civil Monetary Penalties Law also prohibits a person from transferring any remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services.
 The federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties for knowingly submitting or causing the submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to a government-sponsored program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Violations of the False Claims Act present civil liability of treble damages plus a penalty of at least $21,563 per false claim. The False Claims Act has “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions that allow individuals to commence a civil action in the name of the government, and the whistleblower is entitled to share in any subsequent recovery (plus attorney’s fees). Many states also have enacted civil statutes that largely mirror the federal False Claims Act but allow states to impose penalties in a state court. The existence of the False Claims Act, under which so-called qui tam plaintiffs can allege liability for a wide range of regulatory noncompliance, increases the potential for such actions to be brought and has increased the potential financial exposure for such actions. These actions are costly and time-consuming to defend.
 U.S. State and Federal Health Information Privacy and Security Laws
 There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal identifiable information (“PII”), including health information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) is a federal law that required the creation of national standards to protect sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without the patient’s consent or knowledge. In particular, HIPAA establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of PHI, and require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of PHI in electronic form. Biote-certified practitioners and their clinics may be regulated as covered entities under HIPAA. We may be a business associate of our covered entity clients when we are working on behalf of our covered entity clients and providing services to those clients.
 To the extent we qualify as a business associate, we will also be regulated by HIPAA and may be required to provide satisfactory written assurances to our covered entity clients through written business associate agreements that we will provide our services in accordance with HIPAA. Failure to comply with these contractual agreements could lead to loss of clients, contractual liability to our clients, and direct action by HHS Office for Civil Rights, including monetary penalties. Violations of HIPAA may result in significant civil and criminal penalties, including a tiered system of civil monetary penalties that range from $100 to $50,000 per violation, with a cap of $1.5 million per year for identical violations. However, a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. Under the breach notification rule, covered entities must notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay in the case of a breach of unsecured PHI, which may compromise the privacy, security or integrity of the PHI. In addition, notification must be provided to HHS and the local media in cases where a breach affects more than 500 individuals. Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to HHS on an annual basis. HIPAA also requires a business associate to notify its covered entity clients of breaches by the business associate without unreasonable delay and no later than 60 days from the discovery of the breach.
 State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for a HIPAA violation, its standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing personal information. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator. In light of the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule, recent enforcement activity, and statements from HHS, we expect increased federal and state HIPAA privacy and security enforcement efforts.
 Many states where we operate and where patients treated by Biote-certified practitioners reside also have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health information.

These laws may be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA and other federal privacy laws. For example, the laws of the State of California that govern personal information and medical information such as the California Consumer Protection Act or the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, in which we operate, are more restrictive than HIPAA. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA, we must comply with the state laws we are subject to, in addition to HIPAA. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but, unlike HIPAA, some may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. In addition, state laws are changing rapidly, and there have been proposals for a new federal privacy law or federal breach notification law, to which we may be subject.
 In addition to HIPAA and state health information privacy laws, we may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair privacy and security acts or practices and deceptive statements about privacy and security and laws that place specific requirements on certain types of activities, such as data security and texting. The FTC and states’ attorneys general have brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices under the FTC Act and similar state laws. FTC jurisdiction in data privacy and security cases is concurrent with the HHS Office for Civil Rights’ jurisdiction with respect to HIPAA.
 In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of PII and PHI. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials and provide credit monitoring services and/or other relevant services to impacted individuals. In addition, under HIPAA and pursuant to the related contracts that we may enter into with Biote-certified practitioners or Biote-partnered clinics who are covered entities, we must report breaches of unsecured PHI to them following discovery of the breach within a set timeframe. Notification must also be made in certain circumstances to affected individuals, federal and state authorities, media, and other relevant parties.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors.
 Risks Related to Our Industry and Business
 Our success will depend upon whether the Biote Method and our Biote-branded dietary supplements attain significant market acceptance among clinics, practitioners and their patients.
 Our success will depend on the acceptance of the hormone optimization methods we teach in our training. We cannot predict how quickly clinics, practitioners or their patients will accept the Biote Method (as further described in the section entitled “Business”) or, if accepted, how frequently it will be used. The methods that we currently recommend and any methods we recommend in the future may never gain broad market acceptance. Demonstrated HRT health risks or side effects, as well as negative publicity relating to the same, could negatively impact the perception of patient benefit and generate resistance and opposition from practitioners, which could limit adoption of the Biote Method and have a material adverse impact on our business. To date, a substantial majority of our sales and revenue have been derived from a limited number of clinics and independent, third-party physicians and nurse practitioners who are certified under our training program (the “Biote-certified practitioners”).

Our future growth and profitability will largely depend on our ability to increase practitioner awareness of our practice-building platform as well as our Biote-branded dietary supplements, and on the willingness of clinics, practitioners and their patients to adopt them. Practitioners may not adopt the Biote Method unless they determine, based on experience, clinical data, medical society recommendations and other analyses, that our methods and the Biote-branded dietary supplements are appropriate for their patients. Healthcare practitioners must believe that our practice-building platform and Biote-branded dietary supplements offer benefits over alternatives. Even if we are able to raise awareness, practitioners may be slow in changing their medical treatment practices and may be hesitant to use the Biote Method.
 Practitioners independently determine the type of treatment that will be utilized and provided to their patients. We focus our sales, marketing and education efforts primarily in the hormone optimization space and aim to educate Biote-certified practitioners regarding the patient population that would benefit from the Biote Method. Despite our efforts, we cannot assure you that we will achieve broad market acceptance among these practitioners or, more generally, that practitioners will adopt the Biote Method at all. Further, changes in the regulatory or enforcement landscape may be a factor in practitioners choosing certain methods for their patients, for example, medication compounded by a compounding pharmacy or outsourcing facility.
 For example, some Biote-certified practitioners may choose to utilize the Biote Method and our Biote-branded dietary supplements on only a subset of their total patient population or may not adopt our offerings at all. If we are not able to effectively demonstrate that the use of the Biote Method and our Biote-branded dietary supplements is beneficial in a broad range of their patients, adoption of our offerings will be limited and may not occur as rapidly as we anticipate or at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that the Biote Method or our Biote-branded dietary supplements will achieve broad market acceptance among clinics and practitioners. Additionally, even if the Biote Method and our Biote-branded dietary supplements achieve initial market acceptance, they may not maintain that market acceptance over time if competing methods, procedures or technologies are considered more cost-effective or otherwise superior. Any failure of our offerings to generate sufficient demand or to achieve meaningful market acceptance and penetration will harm our future prospects and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Further, if the Biote Method or our Biote-branded dietary supplements do not generate sufficient patient demand for the Biote-certified practitioners or clinics we partner with (“Biote-partnered clinics”), we may be unable to attract or retain contracts with practitioners or clinics to use the Biote Method or sell our Biote-branded dietary supplements. If we are unable to attract or retain contracts with practitioners or clinics, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
 Outsourcing facilities that produce bioidentical hormone pellets that we offer training on in the Biote Method and failure by those parties to adequately perform their obligations could harm our business.
 Outsourcing facilities manufacture the products that we recommend as part of our training. The facilities used to compound and distribute bioidentical hormone pellets, which may be prescribed by Biote-certified practitioners, are registered with the FDA as 503B outsourcing facilities. We do not control or direct the compounding or manufacturing processes used by these outsourcing facilities. We use contract manufacturers to produce the formulations of the dietary supplements we develop and sell under Biote’s private label, and we rely on those manufacturers for compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements. As such, we have no control over the ability of third parties to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable international regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of these products or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to identify alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to meet consumer demand. In addition, our inability to identify or enter into satisfactory arrangements with any such alternative manufacturing facilities may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Further, our reliance on third-party dietary supplement contract manufacturers entails risks, including:
 •inability to meet certain product specifications and quality requirements consistently;
 •delay or inability to procure or expand sufficient manufacturing capacity;
 •issues related to scale-up of manufacturing;
 •costs and validation of new equipment and facilities required for scale-up;
 •third-party manufacturers may not be able to execute necessary manufacturing procedures and other logistical support requirements appropriately;
 •third-party manufacturers may fail to comply with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) requirements and other requirements by the FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities;
 •inability for us or Biote-certified practitioners and Biote-partnered clinics to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms, if at all;
 •breach, termination or non-renewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us or Biote-certified practitioners and Biote-partnered clinics;

•third-party manufacturers may not devote sufficient resources to the products that we recommend as part of our training or our Biote-branded dietary supplements;
 •we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to any improvements made by third-party manufacturers in the manufacturing process for our Biote-branded dietary supplements;
 •operations of third-party manufacturers or our suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier; and
 •logistics carrier disruptions or increased costs that are beyond our control.
 Any adverse developments affecting manufacturing operations for our Biote-branded dietary supplements may result in lot failures, inventory shortages, shipment delays, product withdrawals or recalls or other interruptions in the supply of these products, which could prevent their delivery to Biote-certified practitioners or Biote-partnered clinics. We may also have to write off inventory, incur other charges and expenses to replace dietary supplements that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts, or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives.
 Any of these events could impact our ability to successfully commercialize any future products that we recommend as part of our training and our current or any future Biote-branded dietary supplements. Some of these events could be the basis for FDA action, including injunction, request for recall, seizure, or total or partial suspension of production.
 We and Biote-certified practitioners and Biote-partnered clinics are reliant on AnazaoHealth Corporation, Right Value Drug Stores, LLC. and F.H. Investments, Inc. to support the manufacturing of bio-identical hormones for prescribers.
 We entered into a Pharmacy Services Agreement with AnazaoHealth Corporation, or AnazaoHealth, on October 30, 2020 (the “AnazaoHealth Pharmacy Services Agreement”), an Outsourcing Facility Services Agreement with Right Value Drug Stores, LLC d/b/a Carie Boyd’s Prescription Shop, or Carie Boyd’s on August 1, 2020 (the “Outsourcing Facility Services Agreement”), and a Pharmacy Services Agreement with F.H. Investments, Inc. d/b/a Asteria Health, Asteria Health, on October 28, 2021, to build relationships to support Biote-certified practitioners by offering an option for the compounded bioidentical hormones that the practitioners may order or prescribe (the “Asteria Health Pharmacy Services Agreement”). AnazaoHealth, Carie Boyd’s, and Asteria Health are operators of FDA-registered 503B outsourcing facilities. While Biote-certified practitioners have the option to use a variety of different outsourcing facilities, AnazaoHealth, Carie Boyd’s and Asteria Health are the primary outsourcing facilities of the compound testosterone and estradiol implantable subcutaneous pellets used by Biote-certified practitioners as part of the Biote Method. However, we do not control or direct the compounding or manufacturing processes of these 503B outsourcing facilities. We also do not control the time and resources AnazaoHealth, Carie Boyd’s or Asteria Health devotes to compounding of testosterone and estradiol implantable subcutaneous pellets. If AnazaoHealth, Carie Boyd’s or Asteria Health are unable to successfully fulfill a Biote-certified practitioner’s product orders, or if the state licenses held by AnazaoHealth, Carie Boyd’s or Asteria Health to ship medications for office use throughout the United States are revoked, expire or otherwise not maintained, it could adversely impact the practices of Biote-certified Practitioners or Biote-partnered clinics, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other changes in state and federal regulatory and enforcement with respect to compounded drugs may also affect AnazaoHealth, Carie Boyd’s and Asteria Health, and, in turn, have the potential to harm the practices of Biote-certified practitioners or Biote-partnered clinics or our business.
 Any termination of the AnazaoHealth Pharmacy Services Agreement, the Outsourcing Facility Services Agreement, or the Asteria Health Pharmacy Services Agreement could have an adverse effect on the practices of Biote-certified Practitioners or Biote-partnered clinics our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 In the future, we may also seek to develop relationships with other outsourcing facilities to support the manufacturing of bioidentical hormones for Biote-certified practitioners and Biote-partnered clinics in the United States and internationally, with an initial focus on expansion into Puerto Rico, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Canada and the Dominican Republic, as permitted by law. If we fail to develop new relationships with any other outsourcing facilities we seek to engage, including in new markets in the United States and internationally, fail to manage or incentivize these facilities effectively, or if these facilities are not successful in their sales and marketing efforts, our ability to support to Biote-certified practitioners and Biote-partnered clinics, and to generate revenue, cash flow and earnings growth could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, these agreements may be non-exclusive, and some of these facilities may also have cooperative relationships with certain of our competitors.
 Biote-certified practitioners and Biote-partnered clinics are concentrated in certain geographic regions, which makes us sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive conditions in those regions.
 We generate revenues by charging the Biote-partnered clinics fees associated with the support Biote provides for HRT and from the sale of Biote-branded dietary supplements. During the year ended December 31, 2022, over 64% of our revenue was generated in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Florida. Such geographic concentration makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive conditions in those states. Any
material changes in those factors in those states could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 We may not be successful in expanding into new geographic areas within the United States or internationally. In addition, as we expand into new geographic areas, we may not be able to dedicate enough time or resources to maintain our market share in our core geographic areas, and our business may be negatively impacted.
 The frequency of use by practitioners and clinics of the Biote Method may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all.
 One of our key objectives is to continue to increase utilization, or the adoption and frequency of use, of both the Biote Method and our Biote-branded dietary supplements by new and existing Biote-certified practitioners and Biote-partnered clinics. If utilization by our existing and newly trained Biote-certified practitioners of the Biote Method and the Biote-branded dietary supplements we sell does not occur or does not occur as quickly as we anticipate, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Adoption of the Biote Method depends upon appropriate practitioner training, and inadequate training may lead to negative patient outcomes and adversely affect our business.
 Our success depends in part on the patient selection criteria of Biote-certified practitioners and proper execution of methods discussed in training sessions conducted by our training faculty. However, the practice of medicine is the domain of the Biote-certified practitioners, who rely on their previous medical training and experience, and we cannot guarantee that Biote-certified practitioners will effectively utilize the Biote Method. Patient outcomes may not be consistent across Biote-certified practitioners and Biote-partnered clinics. This result may negatively impact the perception of patient benefit and limit adoption of the Biote Method, and could result in litigation against us, in each case which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 The continuing development of our training depends upon our maintaining strong working relationships with Biote-certified practitioners and other medical personnel.
 The development, marketing and sale of our training depend upon our maintaining working relationships with Biote-certified practitioners and other medical personnel. We rely on these relationships to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development, marketing and sale of our training. For example, Biote-certified practitioners assist us in marketing and as researchers, consultants and public speakers. If we cannot maintain our strong working relationships and continue to receive such advice and input, the development and marketing of our training could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 We believe our long-term value as a company will be greater if we focus on growth, which may negatively impact our results of operations in the near term.
 We believe our long-term value as a company will be greater if we focus on longer-term growth over short-term results. As a result, our results of operations may be negatively impacted in the near term relative to a strategy focused on maximizing short-term profitability. Significant expenditures on marketing efforts, acquisitions and international expansion may not ultimately grow our business or lead to expected long-term results.
 We have experienced substantial growth in our operations, and we expect to experience continued growth in our business. For example, we plan to increase our headcount from 2023 through 2025. This growth has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational infrastructure. Any growth that we experience in the future could require us to expand our sales and marketing personnel and general and administrative infrastructure. In addition to the need to scale our organization, future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on management, including the need to identify, recruit, train and integrate additional employees. We cannot assure you that any increases in scale will be successfully implemented or that appropriate personnel will be available to facilitate the growth of our business. Rapid expansion in personnel could mean that less experienced people market and sell the Biote Method and our Biote-branded dietary supplements, which could result in inefficiencies and unanticipated costs, lowered quality standards and disruptions to our operations. Rapid and significant growth may strain our administrative and operational infrastructure and could require significant capital expenditures that may divert financial resources from other projects, such as research and development of potential future offerings. In addition, our ability to grow may be adversely impacted due to factors beyond our control, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial performance, financial condition and results of operations, and could expose us to liability. Our failure to manage growth effectively could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To manage the growth of our operations, we must establish appropriate and scalable operational and financial systems, procedures and controls and build and maintain a qualified finance, administrative and operations staff. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, including by failing to implement necessary procedures, transition to new processes or hire necessary personnel, we may fail to execute our business strategy which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We face significant competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may not be able to achieve or maintain expected levels of market penetration and market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 The medical practice-building market and dietary supplement industry are highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new offerings and other market activities of industry participants. For example, in the dietary supplement space, we are competing with more than 30 brands of dietary supplements, including that of Evexipel, Pellecome, Pro-Pell, Sottopelle, BodyLogicMD, HTCA and Nature’s Way, that are either available direct to consumer online, through more conventional retailers and department stores and/or sold through practitioners. If we are unable to compete effectively, we will not be able to establish our training and Biote-branded dietary supplements in the marketplace, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, large, well-capitalized pharmaceutical companies may enter the medical practice-building market in the hormone optimization space or dietary supplements market and would be able to spend more on development of their offerings, marketing, sales, compliance and other initiatives than we can. Some of our competitors may have:
 •significantly greater name recognition;
 •broader or deeper relations with healthcare professionals and clinics;
 •more established dietary supplement distribution networks;
 •additional lines of dietary supplements and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or other incentives to gain a competitive advantage;
 •greater experience in conducting research and development, and marketing for their products; and
 •greater financial and human resources for development, sales and marketing and patent prosecution of our offerings.
 Our continued success depends on our ability to:
 •develop innovative training as well as Biote-branded dietary supplements that aim to address patient needs;
 •adapt to regulatory and enforcement changes over time;
 •expand our sales force across key markets to increase the number of Biote-certified practitioners;
 •leverage our Biote-branded dietary supplements;
 •accelerate the expansion of our business into new markets;
 •attract and retain skilled research, development, sales and clinical personnel;
 •cost-effectively market and sell our training and our Biote-branded dietary supplements; and
 •obtain, maintain, enforce and defend our intellectual property rights and operate our business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others.
 We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in developing new training, methods, or Biote-branded dietary supplements or commercializing them in ways that achieve market acceptance. Moreover, any significant delays in the development or commercialization of new training, methods or dietary supplements may significantly impede our ability to enter or compete in a given market and may reduce the sales that we are able to generate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 We have a limited history operating a practice-building business for practitioners in the hormone optimization space, which may make it difficult for an investor to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.
 We have a limited history operating a practice-building business for practitioners in the hormone optimization space. We commenced operations in 2012, and our operations to date have been largely focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing the Biote Method and our training, refining our relationships with outsourcing facilities that can compound the bioidentical hormone pellet products that Biote-certified practitioners may prescribe, as well as manufacturers who produce our Biote-branded dietary supplements. Our limited operating history and evolving business make it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and increase the risk of your investment. Any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or a history of commercializing the Biote Method and our Biote-branded dietary supplements. In addition, as an early-stage company with a limited operating history, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors which may result in our inability to maintain profitability.

Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.
 Our results of operations and key metrics discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report may vary significantly in the future and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results and key metrics may not provide a full picture of our performance. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter or year should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly financial results and metrics may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and as a result they may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. These quarterly fluctuations may negatively affect the value of our securities. Factors that may cause these fluctuations include, without limitation:
 •the level of demand for either the Biote Method or our Biote-branded dietary supplements, which may vary significantly from period to period;
 •our ability to attract new Biote-partnered clinics and Biote-certified practitioners;
 •the addition or loss of one or more of our Biote-partnered clinics or Biote-certified practitioners, including as the result of acquisitions or consolidations;
 •the timing of recognition of revenues;
 •the amount and timing of operating expenses;
 •general economic, industry and market conditions, both domestically and internationally, including any economic downturns and adverse impacts resulting from public health crises, increases in inflation and interest rates and/or the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine;
 •the timing of our billing and collections;
 •Biote-partnered clinic and Biote-certified practitioner renewal, expansion, and adoption rates;
 •increases or decreases in the number of patients that are served by Biote-certified practitioners or Biote-partnered clinics, or pricing changes upon any renewals of Biote-certified practitioner or Biote-partnered clinic agreements;
 •changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;
 •the timing and success of new offerings by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, practitioners, clinics or outsourcing facilities;
 •extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related expenses or settlement payments;
 •sales tax and other tax determinations by authorities in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business;
 •the impact of new accounting pronouncements and the adoption thereof;
 •fluctuations in stock-based compensation expenses;
 •expenses in connection with mergers, acquisitions or other strategic transactions;
 •changes in regulatory and licensing requirements;
 •the amount and timing of expenses related to our expansion to markets outside the United States; and
 •the timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill or intangibles from acquired companies.
 Further, in future periods, our revenue growth could slow or our revenues could decline for a number of reasons, including slowing demand for either the Biote Method or our Biote-branded dietary supplements, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, or our failure, for any reason, to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities. In addition, our growth rate may slow in the future as our market penetration rates increase. As a result, our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in future periods, which could harm our business and cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.
 If we are unable to attract and retain executive officers, key employees and other qualified personnel, or are unable to attract and retain contracts with Biote-certified practitioners, our ability to compete could be harmed.
 Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain our executive officers, key employees and other qualified personnel, and as a relatively small company with key talent residing in a limited number of employees, our operations and prospects may be severely disrupted if we lost any one or more of their services. As we build our brand, expand into new domestic and international territories and become more well known, there is increased risk that competitors or other companies will seek to hire our personnel. While some
of our employees are bound by non-competition agreements, these may prove to be unenforceable. The failure to attract, integrate, train, motivate and retain these personnel could seriously harm our business and prospects.
 In addition, we are highly dependent on the services of several of our executive officers and other senior technical and management personnel, including Teresa S. Weber, our Chief Executive Officer, Marc D. Beer, our Executive Chairman, Samar Kamdar, our Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Ross McQuivey, our Chief Medical Officer, Mary Elizabeth Conlon, our Vice President, Business Development & General Counsel, and Cary Paulette, our Chief Revenue Officer, who would be difficult to replace. If these or other key personnel were to depart, we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business. We do not maintain key person life insurance with respect to any member of management or other employee.
 Further, our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, train and retain contracts with practitioners and clinics. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our base of Biote-certified practitioners and Biote-partnered clinics. If we are unable to attract and retain contracts with practitioners and clinics capable of meeting our business needs and expectations, our business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to grow our practitioner base of Biote-certified practitioners or any material increase in turnover rates of our Biote-certified practitioners may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 The healthcare industry is highly regulated, and government authorities may determine that we have failed to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations.
 The healthcare industry, including the healthcare and other services that we and Biote-certified practitioners provide, are subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, compliance with which imposes substantial costs on us. Of particular importance are the provisions summarized as follows:
 •federal laws (including the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729 (the “False Claims Act”)) that prohibit entities and individuals from intentionally (or with reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance) presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims to government-funded programs, or improperly retaining known overpayments;
 •a provision of the Social Security Act of 1935, as amended, commonly referred to as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, as amended (the “federal Anti-Kickback Statute”), that prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any bribe, kickback, rebate or other remuneration, in cash or in kind, in return for the referral or recommendation of patients for, or for the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for, items and services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by federal healthcare programs;
 •similar state law provisions pertaining to anti-kickback, fee splitting, self-referral and false claims, and other fraud and abuse issues which typically are not limited to relationships involving government-funded programs. In some cases these laws prohibit or regulate additional conduct beyond what federal law affects, including applicability to items and services paid by commercial insurers and private pay patients. Penalties for violating these laws can range from fines to criminal sanctions;
 •provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 1347 that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or artifice to defraud a healthcare benefit program or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
 •FDA marketing and promotion restrictions, as well as several other types of state and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws have been applied in recent years to restrict certain marketing practices in the healthcare industry;
 •federal and state laws related to confidentiality, privacy and security of personal information such as HIPAA, including protected health information (“PHI”), that limit the manner in which we may use and disclose that information, impose obligations to safeguard that information and require that we notify our customers in the event of a breach; and
 •state laws that prohibit general business corporations from practicing medicine, controlling physicians’ medical decisions or engaging in certain practices, such as splitting fees with physicians.
 We plan to expand our operations to new markets outside the United States, creating a variety of operational challenges.
 Although we currently work with numerous clinics that are multi-national in scope, our current business is primarily focused on clinics and practitioners in the United States. A component of our growth strategy involves expanding our operations outside the United States, including expansion into Puerto Rico, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Canada and the Dominican Republic, as permitted by law. We may face difficulties as we expand our operations into new domestic and international markets in which we have limited or no prior operating experience.
 Our growth strategy for expanding our operations outside the United States will require significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks that are different from those in the United States, including:
 •the need to localize and adapt our platform for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages and obtaining local regulatory and legal guidance with associated expenses;

•data privacy laws that require customer data to be stored and processed in a designated territory;
 •difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and working with international partners;
 •different pricing environments, longer sales cycles and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues;
 •new and different sources of competition;
 •weaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the United States;
 •laws and business practices favoring local competitors;
 •compliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations;
 •increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;
 •restrictions on the transfer of funds;
 •fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could increase the price of the products that we recommend as part of our training and of our Biote-branded dietary supplements outside of the United States, increase the expenses of our international operations and expose us to international currency exchange rate risk;
 •adverse tax consequences; and
 •unstable regional and economic political conditions.
 In addition, due to potential costs from any international expansion efforts and potentially higher supplier costs outside of the United States, our international operations may operate with a lower margin profile. As a result, our margins may fluctuate as we expand our operations internationally.
 As we move to expand our business into Central and South America, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to identify and work with international distributors. If our international distributors are unable to expand our business or are unable to provide an adequate training program, our business could be harmed. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully, or to comply with these laws and regulations, could harm our operations, reduce our sales and harm our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, in certain countries, particularly those with developing economies, certain business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, may be more commonplace. Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as partners involved in our international sales, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.
 Some of the outsourcing facilities we work with also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above. Even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if these facilities are not able to successfully manage these risks.
 We may not be able to achieve or maintain satisfactory pricing and margins for our training and the Biote Method or the Biote-branded dietary supplements we sell.
 Companies in our industry have a history of price competition, and we can give no assurance that we will be able to achieve satisfactory prices for the Biote Method, or our Biote-branded dietary supplements, or maintain prices at the levels we have historically achieved. If we are forced to lower the price we charge for the Biote Method or our Biote-branded dietary supplements, our revenue and gross margins will decrease, which will adversely affect our ability to invest in and grow our business. If we are unable to maintain our prices, or if our costs increase and we are unable to offset such increase with an increase in our prices, our margins could erode. We will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressure, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Unforeseen and unpredictable factors affecting the operations of the FDA, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”) and other government agencies, such as changes in funding for the FDA, DEA and other government agencies, could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise delay inspections of the 503B outsourcing facilities of our third-party dietary supplement contract manufacturers, which could negatively impact practitioners and our business.
 The ability of the FDA, the DEA and other governmental agencies to conduct their regulatory duties and activities, including reviewing and approving future products, can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review and response times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.

Since March 2020, when international and domestic inspections were largely placed on hold, the FDA has been working to resume routine surveillance and inspections on a prioritized basis and may experience delays in their regulatory activities. The FDA has developed a rating system to assist in determining when and where it is safest to conduct prioritized domestic inspections and resumed inspections in China and India in 2021. Regulatory authorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to public health crises. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or comparable international regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or comparable international regulatory authorities to timely inspect the facilities of our third-party suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 The size of the markets for our current and future offerings has not been established with precision and may be smaller than we estimate.
 Biote-certified practitioners primarily focus their treatments on women experiencing symptoms due to hormonal imbalance before, during, and after menopause, and men experiencing symptoms of hypogonadism and male sex hormone deficiency. It is estimated that, as of 2020, the total U.S. market opportunity for HRT products, available in various forms, exceeds $7 billion and is expected to grow 7% annually through 2026. We believe our business opportunity in providing educational and practice management services is large and will similarly grow. Our estimates of our total addressable markets for our current offerings and those under development are based on a number of internal and third-party estimates, including, without limitation, the number of practitioners we can offer our training and Biote-branded dietary supplements to and the assumed prices at which we can sell offerings in markets that have not been established or that we have not yet entered. While we believe our assumptions and the data underlying our estimates are reasonable, these assumptions and estimates may not be correct and the conditions supporting our assumptions or estimates may change at any time, thereby reducing the predictive accuracy of these estimates. As a result, our estimates of the total addressable market for our current or future offerings may prove to be incorrect. If the actual number of a Biote-certified practitioner’s or Biote-partnered clinic’s patients who would benefit from the Biote Method or our Biote-branded dietary supplements, the price at which we can sell training and Biote-branded dietary supplements, or the total addressable market for the Biote Method or our Biote-branded dietary supplements is smaller than we have estimated, it may impair our sales growth and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Our forecasted operating and financial results rely upon assumptions and analyses developed by us. If these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, our actual operating and financial results may be significantly below our forecasts.
 Whether actual operating and financial results and business developments will be consistent with our expectations, assumptions and analyses as reflected in our forecasted operating and financial results depends on a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, but not limited to:
 •whether we can obtain sufficient capital to grow our business;
 •our ability to manage our growth;
 •whether we can manage relationships with 503B outsourcing facilities and dietary supplement contract manufacturers, and other key suppliers;
 •demand for the Biote Method and our Biote-branded dietary supplements;
 •the timing and costs of new and existing marketing and promotional efforts;
 •competition, including from established and future competitors;
 •our ability to retain existing key management, to integrate recent hires and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel;
 •the overall strength and stability of the economies in the markets in which we operate or intend to operate in the future; and
 •regulatory, legislative and political changes.
 Unfavorable changes in any of these or other factors, most of which are beyond our control, could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.
 If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses.

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We believe that the accounting policies described reflect our most critical accounting policies and estimates (including with respect to revenue recognition and the valuation of inventory), which represent those that involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these policies are critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial condition and results of operations.
 Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock.
 Off-label promotion may result in civil and criminal fines and other penalties, as well as product liability suits, which could be costly to our business.
 Biote does not manufacture or distribute any drug products. Nevertheless, if the FDA determines that our practitioner training, including our paid consultants’ educational materials, constitutes off-label drug promotion, it could subject us or our business partners to enforcement action, including warning letters, untitled letters, fines and penalties, including criminal fines and/or prosecution. If we are found to have inappropriately marketed or promoted any drugs, we may become subject to significant liability. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines and/or other penalties against companies for alleged improper promotion and has investigated, prosecuted and/or enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. If we become subject to civil or criminal fines or other penalties, or product liability suits, such fines, penalties or lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of Biote entered into that certain credit agreement which contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants that may limit its flexibility in operating its businesses.
 On May 26, 2022, certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of Biote entered into that certain Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with BioTE Medical, LLC (the “BioTE Medical”) as borrower, and Truist Bank, as administrative agent, in connection with the Closing of the Business Combination. The Credit Agreement provides to borrower a $125.0 million five-year senior secured term loan A facility (the “Term Loan”) and a $50.0 million revolving line of credit. The proceeds of the Credit Agreement have been used to repay existing debt, pay fees and expenses in connection with the Business Combination, and for general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants that could limit the manner in which Biote conducts its business, and Biote may be unable to expand or fully pursue its business strategies, engage in favorable business activities, or finance future operations or capital needs. Biote’s ability to comply with the covenants under the Credit Agreement may be affected by events beyond its control, and it may not be able to comply with those covenants. A breach of any of the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement could result in a default under the Credit Agreement, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under the facility to become immediately due and payable. If Biote is unable to generate sufficient cash to repay its debt obligations under the Credit Agreement when they become due and payable, either as such obligations become due, when they mature, or in the event of a default, Biote may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Further, borrowings under the Credit Agreement are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. In recent months, global inflation and other factors have resulted in an increase in interest rates generally, which has impacted our borrowing costs. If interest rates were to continue to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness referred to above would increase even if the principal amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows will correspondingly decrease.
Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we offer or may develop.
 We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that the products that we recommend as part of our training or our Biote-branded dietary supplements caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:
 •decreased demand for the Biote Method and our Biote-branded dietary supplements;
 •decreased demand for any new methods, training, or products that we may develop;
 •injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;
 •significant costs to defend the related litigation, including the risk that any Biote-certified practitioners who may face such related litigation may in turn seek to recover from us;
 •substantial monetary awards paid to patients;
 •loss of revenue;
 •exhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources;

•reduced resources for our management to pursue our business strategy; and
 •the inability to commercialize any methods, training, or products that we may develop.
 Although we maintain product liability insurance coverage, such insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur and we may need to increase our insurance coverage. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.
 Further, a Biote-certified practitioner’s failure to follow our training and the Biote Method, or accepted medical practices in any stage of treatment may result in lawsuits against us.
 If we experience significant disruptions in our information technology systems, our business may be adversely affected.
 We depend on our information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business, including to support Biote Method, our end-to-end platform to enable Biote-certified practitioners to establish, build, and successfully operate a Biote-partnered clinic for optimizing hormone levels in their specific aging patient population, the distribution and maintenance of our Biote-branded dietary supplements, as well as for accounting, data storage, compliance, purchasing and inventory management. Our information technology systems may be subject to computer viruses, ransomware or other malware, attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, damage or interruption from fires or other natural disasters, hardware failures, telecommunication failures and user errors, among other malfunctions. We could be subject to any number of unintentional events that could involve a third-party gaining unauthorized access to our systems, which could disrupt our operations, corrupt our data or result in release of our confidential information. Technological interruptions could disrupt our operations, including our ability to project inventory requirements, manage our supply chain and otherwise adequately service our Biote-partnered clinics and Biote-certified practitioners or disrupt their ability use the Biote Method and our Biote-branded dietary supplements for treatments. In the event we experience significant disruptions, we may be unable to repair our systems in an efficient and timely manner. Accordingly, such events may disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our entire operation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of the Biote Method and our Biote-branded dietary supplements could be delayed or disrupted.
 We are increasingly dependent on complex information technology to manage our infrastructure. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance our existing systems. Failure to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 We may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management.
 From time to time, we may consider strategic transactions, such as acquisitions of companies, asset purchases and out-licensing or in-licensing of intellectual property, products or technologies. Any future transactions could increase our near and long-term expenditures, result in potentially dilutive issuances of our securities, including our Class A common stock, or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or acquired in-process research and development expenses, any of which could affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Additional potential transactions that we may consider in the future include a variety of business arrangements, including spin-offs, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and investments. Future acquisitions may also require us to obtain additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. These transactions may never be successful and may require significant time and attention of management. In addition, the integration of any business that we may acquire in the future may disrupt our existing business and may be a complex, risky and costly endeavor for which we may never realize the full benefits of the acquisition. Accordingly, although we may not undertake or successfully complete any additional transactions of the nature described above, any additional transactions that we do complete could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
 Our insurance policies are expensive and only protect us from some business risks, which will leave us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities.
 We carry business interruption coverage to mitigate certain potential losses, but this insurance is limited in amount and may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to our operations. We cannot be certain that such potential losses will not exceed our policy limits, insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. In addition, we may be subject to changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements.
 Further, we do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. Some of the policies we currently maintain include products and completed operations liability, business personal property and directors’ and officers’ insurance. We do not know, however, if we will be able to maintain insurance with adequate levels of coverage. Any significant uninsured liability may
require us to pay substantial amounts, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Our employees, independent contractors, consultants, Biote-certified practitioners, Biote-partnered clinics, medical advisors and suppliers may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with professional and regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 We are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, consultants, Biote-certified practitioners, Biote-partnered clinics, medical advisors and suppliers may engage in misconduct or other improper activities. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates: (i) FDA laws and regulations or those of comparable international regulatory authorities, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA, (ii) compounding and manufacturing standards, (iii) federal and state data privacy, security, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable international regulatory authorities, or (iv) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.
 Extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, and other catastrophic events, including those caused by climate change, could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
 Extreme weather conditions and volatile changes in weather conditions in the areas in which our offices, suppliers, Biote-partnered clinics, dietary supplement third-party manufacturers, and suppliers are located could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, monsoons or wildfires, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics (including, for example, the COVID-19 pandemic), political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war and other political instability, or other catastrophic events, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that could negatively impact practitioner or clinic spending, any or all of which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. In particular, these types of events could impact our global supply chain, including the ability of manufacturers to produce our Biote-branded dietary supplement products to Biote-partnered clinics or Biote-certified practitioners from or to the impacted region(s). For instance, in 2022 we experienced hurricane-related closures of 140 medical clinics in Florida and Puerto Rico, two of our key markets. If such closures continue or we experience similar closures in the future, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, such as actual events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by financial institutions could adversely affect our current financial condition and projected business operations.
 Actual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. For example, on March 10, 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) took control and was appointed receiver of Silicon Valley Bank. Similarly, on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp. were each swept into receivership. Although the FDIC announced that all deposits with these banks would be fully insured, there continues to be uncertainty in the markets regarding the stability of regional banks and the safety of deposits in excess of the FDIC insured deposit limits. If other banks and financial institutions enter receivership or become insolvent in the future in response to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets, our ability to access our existing cash may be threatened. The FDIC only insures accounts in amounts up to $250,000 per depositor per insured bank, and we currently have cash deposited in certain financial institutions significantly in excess of FDIC insured levels. If any of the banking institutions in which we have deposited funds ultimately fails, we may lose our deposits over $250,000. The loss of our deposits may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. The ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted, but these events could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Market and economic conditions may negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition and stock price.
 Concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, unstable global credit markets and financial conditions, and volatile oil prices could lead to periods of significant economic instability, diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence and discretionary spending, diminished expectations for the global economy and expectations of slower global economic growth going forward. For example, in December 2022, the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures a wide-ranging basket of goods and services, rose 6.5% from the same month a year ago. The Company’s general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such inflationary fluctuations, economic downturns, volatile business environments and continued unstable or unpredictable economic and market conditions. Additionally, rising costs of
goods and services purchased by the Company, including its raw materials used in manufacturing its product, may have an adverse effect on the Company’s gross margins and profitability in future periods. Increased inflation rates can adversely affect us by increasing our costs, including labor and employee benefit costs. Any significant increases in inflation and related increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If economic and market conditions continue to deteriorate or do not improve, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to complete, more costly and more dilutive to the Company’s stockholders. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner or on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial performance and stock price or could require the Company to delay or abandon development other business plans. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of the Company’s current and future service providers, manufacturers, suppliers, and other facilities, and other partners could be negatively affected by such difficult economic factors, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to attain its operating goals on schedule and on budget or meet its business and financial objectives.
 Risks Related to Intellectual Property
 If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for any products or methods we develop, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products similar or identical to our Biote-branded dietary supplements, and our ability to successfully commercialize any products we may develop may be adversely affected. If we are not able to maintain freedom to operate for our products from third-party intellectual property rights, our ability to commercialize products may be limited unless we secure a license to such rights.
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our Biote-branded dietary supplements.
 We rely on a combination of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights to protect the proprietary aspects of our brands, technologies, and data. These legal measures afford only limited protection, and competitors or others may gain access to or use our intellectual property and proprietary information. Our success will depend, in part, on preserving our trade secrets, maintaining the security of our data and know-how, obtaining and maintaining patents and obtaining other intellectual property rights.
 We may not be able to obtain and maintain intellectual property or other proprietary rights necessary to our business or in a form that provides us with a competitive advantage. For example, our trade secrets, data and know-how could be subject to unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure to unauthorized parties, despite our efforts to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors, clients and other vendors who have access to such information and could otherwise become known or be independently discovered by third parties. In addition, the patent prosecution process is expensive, time-consuming and complex, and we may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain, enforce or license all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, or in all jurisdictions where protection may be commercially advantageous, or we may not be able to protect our intellectual property at all. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may be able to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output in time to obtain patent protection. Although we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to confidential or patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees, consultants, contractors, collaborators, Biote-certified practitioners, Biote-partnered clinics, vendors and other third parties, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection.
 Our other intellectual property, including our trademarks, could also be challenged, invalidated, infringed and circumvented by third parties, and our trademarks could also be diluted, declared generic or found to be infringing on other marks, in which case we could be forced to re-brand our Biote-branded dietary supplements, resulting in loss of brand recognition and requiring us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands, and suffer other competitive harm. Third parties may also adopt trademarks similar to ours, which could harm our brand identity and lead to market confusion.
 We may in the future also be subject to claims by our former employees, consultants or contractors asserting an ownership right in our patents or patent applications, as a result of the work they performed on our behalf. Although we generally require all of our employees, consultants, contractors and any other collaborators who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to assign or grant similar rights to their inventions to us, we cannot be certain that we have executed such agreements with all parties who may have contributed to our intellectual property, nor can we be certain that our agreements with such parties will be upheld in the face of a potential challenge, or that they will not be breached, for which we may not have an adequate remedy.
 Failure to obtain and maintain patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights necessary to our business and failure to protect, monitor and control the use of our intellectual property rights could negatively impact our ability to compete and cause us to incur significant expenses. The intellectual property laws and other statutory and contractual arrangements in the United States and other jurisdictions we depend upon may not provide sufficient protection in the future to prevent the infringement, use, violation or misappropriation of our patents, trademarks, data, technology and other intellectual property, and may not provide an adequate remedy if our intellectual property rights are infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.

We may become a party to intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings that could be costly and could interfere with our ability to sell and market the Biote Method and our Biote-branded dietary supplements.
 Our industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights, and companies in the industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. It is possible that we may be accused of misappropriating third parties’ trade secrets. Additionally, our Biote-branded dietary supplements are produced by third-party vendors and may include components that are outside of our direct control. Our competitors may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for or obtain, patents or trademarks that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to use and sell the Biote Method, or use, sell and/or export our Biote-branded dietary supplements, or our ability to use product names. Moreover, in recent years, individuals and groups that are non-practicing entities, commonly referred to as “patent trolls,” have purchased patents and other intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement in order to extract settlements. From time to time, we may receive threatening letters, notices or “invitations to license,” or may be the subject of claims that the Biote Method, our Biote-branded dietary supplements and business operations infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others. The defense of these matters can be time consuming, costly to defend in litigation, divert management’s attention and resources, damage our reputation and brand and cause us to incur significant expenses or make substantial payments. Vendors from whom we purchase products may not indemnify us in the event that such products accused of infringing a third-party’s patent or trademark or of misappropriating a third-party’s trade secret, or any indemnification granted by such vendors may not be sufficient to address any liability and costs we incur as a result of such claims. Additionally, we may be obligated to indemnify Biote-partnered clinics, Biote-certified practitioners or business partners in connection with litigation and to obtain licenses, which could further exhaust our resources.
 Even if we believe a third-party’s intellectual property claims are without merit, there is no assurance that a court would find in our favor, including on questions of infringement, validity, enforceability or priority of patents. The strength of our defenses will depend on the patents asserted, the interpretation of these patents, and our ability to invalidate the asserted patents. A court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are valid, enforceable and infringed, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to commercialize any products or technology we may develop and any other products or technologies covered by the asserted third-party patents. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any such U.S. patent in federal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity. As this burden is a high one requiring us to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of any such U.S. patent claim, there is no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction would invalidate the claims of any such U.S. patent. Conversely, the patent owner need only prove infringement by a preponderance of the evidence, which is a lower burden of proof.
 Further, if patents, trademarks or trade secrets are successfully asserted against us, this may harm our business and result in injunctions preventing us from selling the Biote Method and our Biote-branded dietary supplements, or result in obligations to pay license fees, damages, attorney fees and court costs, which could be significant. In addition, if we are found to willfully infringe third-party patents or trademarks or to have misappropriated trade secrets, we could be required to pay treble damages in addition to other penalties.
 Although patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property disputes have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. We may be unable to obtain necessary licenses, if any, on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, if any license we obtain is non-exclusive, we may not be able to prevent our competitors and other third parties from using the intellectual property or technology covered by such license to compete with us. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Similarly, interference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”), may be necessary to determine priority with respect to our patents, patent applications, trademarks or trademark applications. We may also become involved in other proceedings, such as reexamination, inter partes review, derivation or opposition proceedings before the USPTO or other jurisdictional body relating to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent third-party suppliers from manufacturing our Biote-branded dietary supplements, which would have a significant adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Additionally, we have filed and may in the future file lawsuits or initiate other proceedings to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful. We are currently party to two open litigation matters involving terminated practices and practitioners who we filed suit against to enforce post-termination contractual obligations where the defendants offered a competing hormone pellet therapy within the contractual two-year restrictive period without paying our requisite buy-out or residual benefit fee.
 Competitors may infringe our issued patents or other intellectual property, which we may not always be able to detect. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property or alleging that our intellectual property is invalid or unenforceable. Grounds for a validity
challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may raise challenges to the validity of certain of our owned patent claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, interference proceedings, derivation proceedings and equivalent proceedings in international jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). In any such lawsuit or other proceedings, a court or other administrative body may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent’s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question.
 The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. If a third-party were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the protection on products that we may develop. If our patents are found to be valid and infringed, a court may refuse to grant injunctive relief against the infringer and instead grant us monetary damages and/or ongoing royalties. Such monetary compensation may be insufficient to adequately offset the damage to our business caused by the infringer’s competition in the market. An adverse result in any litigation or other proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our Class A common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential or sensitive information could be compromised by disclosure in the event of litigation. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent and other intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our other proprietary information, our business and competitive position may be harmed.
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on other proprietary rights, including protection of trade secrets, and other proprietary information that is not patentable or that we elect not to patent. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect and some courts are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. To maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary information, we rely heavily on confidentiality provisions that we have in contracts with our employees, consultants, contractors, Biote-certified practitioners, collaborators and others upon the commencement of their relationship with us. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or proprietary technology and processes. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by such third parties, despite the existence generally of these confidentiality restrictions. These contracts may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. There can be no assurance that such third parties will not breach their agreements with us, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors. Despite the protections we do place on our intellectual property or other proprietary rights, monitoring unauthorized use and disclosure of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property or other proprietary rights will be adequate. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. The laws of many countries will not protect our intellectual property or other proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Consequently, we may be unable to prevent our proprietary technology from being exploited in the United States and abroad, which could affect our ability to expand in domestic and international markets or require costly efforts to protect our technology.
 To the extent our intellectual property or other proprietary information protection is incomplete, we are exposed to a greater risk of direct competition. A third-party could, without authorization, copy or otherwise obtain and use our Biote-branded dietary supplements, technology, or develop similar technology. Our competitors could purchase our Biote-branded dietary supplements and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts or design around our protected technology. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could substantially harm the value of our Biote-branded dietary supplements, as well as the value of our brand and business. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could reduce the differentiation of our Biote-branded dietary supplements and harm our business, the value of our investment in development or business acquisitions could be reduced and third parties might make claims against us related to losses of their confidential or proprietary information.

Further, it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology, and in such cases, we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our trade secret rights and related confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions. If we fail to obtain or maintain trade secret protection, or if our competitors obtain our trade secrets or independently develop technology similar to ours or competing technologies, our competitive market position could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, some courts are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets, and agreement terms that address non-competition are difficult to enforce in many jurisdictions and might not be enforceable in certain cases.
 We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and other confidential information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and detecting the disclosure or misappropriation of confidential information and enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated confidential information is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Further, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any breach. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or contractors have wrongfully used, disclosed or otherwise misappropriated the intellectual property of a third-party, including trade secrets or know-how, or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors or claims asserting an ownership interest in intellectual property we regard as our own.
 Many of our employees, consultants and contractors were previously employed at or engaged by other medical device, biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees, consultants and contractors may have executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and contractors do not use the intellectual property, proprietary information, know-how or trade secrets of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these individuals have, inadvertently or otherwise, used, disclosed or otherwise misappropriated intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of their former employers or our competitors or potential competitors. Additionally, we may be subject to claims from third parties challenging our ownership interest in intellectual property we regard as our own, based on claims that our employees, consultants or contractors have breached an obligation to assign inventions to another employer, to a former employer, or to another person or entity.
 Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims, and it may be necessary or we may desire to enter into a license to settle any such claim; however, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If our defense to those claims fails, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. For example, a court could prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to the Biote Method or our Biote-branded dietary supplements, if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employer. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.
 An inability to incorporate technologies or features that are important or essential to the Biote Method and our Biote-branded dietary supplements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and may prevent us from providing our training and selling our Biote-branded dietary supplements. Any litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees or contract with independent sales representatives. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize the products that we recommend as part of our training and our Biote-branded dietary supplements, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 We may be subject to claims challenging our intellectual property.
 We or our licensors may be subject to claims that former consultants, contractors or other third parties have an interest in our trade secrets or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. While it is our policy to require our employees, consultants and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. If we or our licensors fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, intellectual property that is important to our Biote-branded dietary supplements. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

If our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build brand recognition in our markets and our business may be adversely affected.
 We rely on trademarks, service marks, trade names and brand names to distinguish our training and Biote-branded dietary supplements from our competitors and have registered or applied to register these trademarks. Our registered or unregistered trademarks, service marks, trade names and brand names may be challenged, infringed, diluted, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. Additionally, we cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be approved. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in proceedings before the USPTO and comparable agencies in many international jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our Biote-branded dietary supplements, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote significant resources towards advertising and marketing new brands. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In some cases, we may need to litigate claims to enforce our rights in our marks to avoid market confusion. Certain of our current or future trademarks may become so well known by the public that their use becomes generic and they lose trademark protection. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
 Risks Related to Regulation
 We market dietary supplements and convenience kits, which are regulated by the FDA, and are subject to certain requirements under the FDCA and the laws enforced by the FTC. Our failure to meet those requirements could cause us to cease certain of our business activities and may involve the payment of financial penalties.
 We sell dietary supplements and convenience kits, which are regulated by the FDA. Each of these product categories have differing requirements that must be followed to ensure compliance with the FDCA and regulations promulgated thereunder, and failure to do so may result in the products being misbranded or adulterated. If we are found to have manufactured, distributed, sold, or labeled any products in violation of the FDCA, we may face significant penalties which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 The FTC enforces the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTCA”) and related regulations, which governs the advertising associated with the promotion and sale of our Biote-branded dietary supplements to prevent misleading or deceptive claims. For advertisements relating to dietary supplements, the FTC typically requires all factual claims, both express and implied, to be substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence. The FTC has promulgated policies and guidance that apply to advertising for dietary supplements that may be costly to comply with. The FDA may also determine that a particular dietary supplement or ingredient that we may market presents an unacceptable health risk. If that occurs, we could be required to cease distribution of and/or recall Biote-branded dietary supplements containing that ingredient.
 The FDA or FTC may also determine that certain labeling, advertising and promotional claims, statements or activities with respect to a dietary supplement are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and may determine that a particular statement is an unapproved health claim, a drug claim, a false or misleading claim, or a deceptive advertising claim. Any such determination or any other failure to comply with FDA, FTCA or other regulatory requirements could prevent us from marketing our Biote-branded dietary supplements as a dietary supplement and subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties. The FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for making false or misleading advertising claims and for failing to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising. These enforcement actions have often resulted in warning letters, consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties and/or restitution by the companies involved. Should the FTC determine that our claims are false or misleading or unsubstantiated, we could be subject to FTC enforcement action and may face significant penalties which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 We have developed and market a method and training program where the practitioner may prescribe a compounded bioidentical hormone. Compounded drugs are regulated by the FDA and are subject to certain requirements under the FDCA. Failure of compounding entities to meet those requirements could cause us to cease certain of our business activities and may involve the payment of financial penalties.
 While we do not sell compounded or prescription drugs, we have developed and market a method and training program where the practitioner may prescribe a compounded bioidentical hormone that is made by a third-party 503B outsourcing facility and requires compliance with the FDCA, and failure to do so may result in the products being misbranded or adulterated. Amendments to the FDCA in 2013 created Section 503B, which creates a category of compounding pharmacies known as “outsourcing facilities” which are subject to certain FDCA requirements, including the requirement to adhere to cGMP regulations, though it exempts such facilities from certain of the FDCA requirements that otherwise apply to drug manufacturers. Understanding and complying with these laws and regulations may require substantial time, money, and effort. While we have only established relationships with 503B outsourcing facilities to support practitioners, if we are found to have manufactured, distributed, marketed, sold, or labeled any
products in violation of the FDCA, we may face significant penalties which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Compounded preparations and the pharmacy compounding industry are subject to regulatory scrutiny, which may impair our growth and sales.
 Formulations prepared and dispensed by compounding pharmacies are not approved by the FDA. As we are a medical marketing and training company, we do not manufacture or compound pharmaceutical products. However, we contract with FDA-registered 503B outsourcing facilities to build relationships to support Biote-certified practitioners by offering an option for the compounding of bioidentical hormone pellets that the practitioner may order to prescribe. These pellets, compounded by 503B outsourcing facilities, are not subject to the FDA new drug approval process. Certain compounding pharmacies have been the subject of widespread negative media coverage in recent years.
 Additionally, the outsourcing facilities with which we have relationships must comply with applicable provision of the FDCA and its implementing regulations. They may only distribute compounded drugs either pursuant to a patient-specific prescription or in response to an order from a healthcare provider, such as a hospital, that is not for an identified individual patient (e.g., for office stock). Further, such outsourcing facilities are inspected by the FDA according to a risk-based schedule, and must meet certain other conditions, such as reporting adverse events and providing the FDA with certain information about the products they compound. When the FDA finds that a manufacturer has violated FDA regulations, the FDA may notify the manufacturer of such violations in the form of a warning letter. The FDA also will issue an FDA Form 483 at the conclusion of an inspection if an investigator has observed a violative condition relating to the manufacturing and storage conditions of any drug product that may result in the product being adulterated, or any other regulatory non-compliance such as inadequate reporting or record-keeping. The outsourcing facilities with which we have relationships have each received warning letters and FDA Form 483s from the FDA. If the FDA takes enforcement action against outsourcing facilities with which we have relationships, it may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.
 Additionally, state laws and regulations may differ from the FDCA. We and the 503B outsourcing facilities are required to comply with state laws and regulations in the states where we and they do business. Efforts to ensure compliance with these laws may require ongoing substantial cost. For example, some of the 503B outsourcing facilities with which we have relationships have received unfavorable enforcement actions from state regulators for non-compliance. Failure to comply with applicable state laws and regulations could expose us and these 503B outsourcing facilities to significant penalties which may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 If a compounded drug formulation provided through a compounding pharmacy or an outsourcing facility leads to patient injury or death or results in a product recall, we may be exposed to significant liabilities and reputational harm.
 We could be adversely affected if compounded pellets are subject to negative publicity. We could also be adversely affected if compounded pellets sold by any compounding outsourcing facilities, prove to be, or are asserted to be, harmful to patients or are otherwise subject to negative publicity. For example, in 2015, the FDA required labeling changes for prescription testosterone replacement therapy to warn of increased risk of heart attacks and strokes. There are a number of factors that could result in the injury or death of a patient who receives a compounded formulation, including quality issues, manufacturing or labeling flaws, improper packaging or unanticipated or improper uses of the products, any of which could result from human or other error. Any of these situations could lead to a recall of, or safety alert relating to, one or more of the products we recommend as part of our training. Similarly, to the extent any of the components of approved drugs or other ingredients used by the outsourcing facilities with whom we have relationships have quality or other problems that adversely affect the finished compounded preparations, our sales could be adversely affected. For example, some of the contracted outsourcing facilities have been the subject of civil suits alleging patient harm as a result of an improper formulation unrelated to the products we recommend. If a product which we recommend as part of our training becomes the subject of a civil or criminal suit, we may be subject to significant liability for any damages suffered by the plaintiffs and associated costs and penalties. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, a voluntarily recall of one of the products we recommend as part of our training or may be instituted in response to a practitioner or clinic complaint. Because of our dependence upon medical and patient perceptions, any adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from the use or misuse of the compounded products we recommend as part of our training or any other compounded formulations made or sold by other companies, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 If the FDA takes regulatory action to implement any of the NASEM recommendations for compounded bioidentical hormones, this may have a substantial effect on the ability of the outsourcing facilities to compound the hormone pellets utilized by Biote-certified practitioners, which would have a substantially negative impact on Biote’s revenue and business operations.
 In fall 2018, the FDA commissioned the NASEM to appoint an ad hoc committee to examine the clinical utility of treating patients with compounded bioidentical hormones. The NASEM committee held a series of open and closed sessions from March 2019 to April 2020, to examine data, research, and stakeholder input in order to form conclusions and recommendations regarding the clinical utility of these products. On July 1, 2020, the NASEM committee published its report, wherein it concluded that there is a lack
of high-quality clinical evidence to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of these products and, accordingly, that there is insufficient evidence to support the overall clinical utility of these products as treatment for menopause and male hypogonadism symptoms. The NASEM Committee recommended restricted use of these products, assessments of their difficulty to compound, and additional education, state and federal regulatory oversight, and research.
 More specifically, NASEM Committee made six recommendations to the FDA: (1) Restrict the use of compounded bioidentical hormone preparations; (2) Review select bioidentical hormone therapies and dosage forms as candidates for the FDA Difficult to Compound List; (3) Improve education for prescribers and pharmacists who market, prescribe, compound, and dispense these preparations; (4) Additional federal and state-level oversight should be implemented to better address public health and clinical concerns regarding the safety and effectiveness of these preparations; (5) Collect and disclose conflicts of interest; and (6) Strengthen and expand the evidence base on the safety, effectiveness, and use of these preparations. NASEM’s report is purely advisory and non-binding on the FDA. Biote cannot predict whether or not the FDA will accept the recommendations made in the NASEM report in whole, in part, or whether the FDA will reject NASEM’s recommendations. If the FDA were to take regulatory action to implement any of NASEM’s recommendations, in whole or in part, this may have a substantial effect on the ability of the outsourcing facilities to compound the hormone pellets utilized by Biote-certified practitioners as part of the Biote Method, and, in turn, have a substantially negative impact on Biote’s revenue and business operations.
 Failure to comply with the FDCA and analogous state laws and regulations can result in administrative, civil, criminal penalties.
 The FDA, acting under the scope of the FDCA and its implementing regulations, has broad authority to regulate the manufacture, distribution, and labeling of many products, including medical devices, cosmetics, drugs, and food, including dietary supplements (FDA-regulated products). The FDCA prohibits, among other things, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any FDA-regulated product that is adulterated or misbranded, as well as the adulteration or misbranding of any FDA-regulated product while the product is in interstate commerce. However, the FDCA does not regulate the practice of medicine. Drugs that are compounded pursuant to a practitioner’s orders are considered to be the result of a compounding pharmacy or practitioner combining, mixing, or altering ingredients to create a medication tailored for the needs of a particular patient, and are not regulated as new drugs under the FDCA. We have developed relationships with 503B outsourcing facilities who compound bioidentical pellets to support Biote-certified practitioners who prescribe such products. If any of these compounded bioidentical hormone pellets are determined to be unapproved new drugs or are determined to be adulterated or misbranded under the FDCA, we could be subject to enforcement action by the FDA. If any of our operations are found to have violated the FDCA or any other federal, state, or local statute or regulation that may apply to us and our business, we could face significant penalties including the seizure of product, civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, and diminished profits and future earnings. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be significantly impaired. Additionally, the FDA or analogous state agencies could determine that we or the outsourcing facilities with whom we have relationships are not in compliance with the FDCA or analogous or related state laws applicable to outsourcing facilities, which could significantly impact our business. Further, the FDA could recommend a voluntary recall, or issue a public health notification or safety notification about one or more of the products we recommend in training, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 If we fail to comply with FDA or state regulations governing our Biote-branded dietary supplements, our business could suffer.
 We also market Biote-branded dietary supplements that are regulated by the FDA or state regulatory authorities. We may need to develop and maintain a robust compliance and quality program to ensure that the products that we market comply with all applicable laws and regulation, including the FDCA. If we are found to have manufactured, distributed, sold, or labeled any products in violation of the FDCA, we may face significant penalties which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, in May 2017, we received a warning letter from the FDA concerning both cGMP violations observed during a 2016 FDA inspection of our facility, and unapproved new drug claims that were made for certain of our dietary supplement products (the “Warning Letter”). Although our response to the Warning Letter resulted in a closeout by the FDA in May 2018, we cannot assure you that we will not receive warning letters or other regulatory action by the FDA on the same or similar violations in the future.
 If we fail to comply with FDA regulations governing our medical device products, our business could suffer.
 We also offer for sale to practitioners two convenience kits for use with hormone optimization therapies, one for male patients and one for female patients. These kits largely contain commercially available products, including only disposable supplies (e.g., gloves, antiseptic, gauze, disposable trocar, etc.) assembled in a sterile package. The products contained in the kits are sourced, assembled, and supplied by Medline Industries, LP, with the components, including the Class 1 disposable trocars, being manufactured by various other component suppliers. Trocars and convenience kits are medical devices that are regulated by the FDA. Because we previously manufactured and sold reusable and disposable trocars, we registered with the FDA as a repackager, relabeler and specification developer, and we currently list the trocars we previously manufactured and the convenience kits we currently sell in compliance with FDA registration and listing requirements. We may need to develop and maintain a robust compliance and quality program to ensure that the convenience kits we sell comply with all applicable laws and regulation, including the FDCA and other
regulatory requirements thereunder including for example cGMPs and Medical Device Reporting (MDR) where applicable. If the FDA determines that the convenience kits we sell require 510(k) clearance, or are otherwise considered unapproved medical devices, we may be in violation of the FDCA.
 Additionally, we offer our proprietary clinical decision support (“CDS”) software to practitioners to provide information from published literature and clinical guidelines to assist practitioners in providing precise, patient-specific treatment options at various intervals through a patient’s therapy. The FDA has recently issued a non-binding final CDS guidance that significantly narrows what the agency considers non-device CDS. If the FDA determines that our CDS is a medical device under the FDCA, the FDA may determine that our algorithm requires premarket approval or clearance, and may determine that unless and until we obtain such premarket approval or clearance that we are distributing an unapproved medical device in violation of the FDCA. If we are found to have manufactured, distributed, sold, or labeled any medical devices in violation of the FDCA, we may face significant penalties which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 If we fail to comply with healthcare and other governmental regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
 Our relationships with Biote-certified practitioners, Biote-partnered clinics, outsourcing facilities, and suppliers may subject us to a variety of healthcare laws including, among others, laws that prohibit fraud and abuse, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, the healthcare fraud provisions of HIPAA, and state anti-kickback statutes that prohibit any person from offering, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients or the purchase, order, or recommendation of any good or service and fee splitting laws, which prohibit a practitioner from dividing compensation for their professional services with a person who did not render the service. Violations of these laws are punishable by substantial penalties and other remedies, including monetary fines, civil penalties, administrative remedies, criminal sanctions (in the case of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain state anti-kickback laws) and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such laws.
 Additionally, most states do not allow business corporations to employ practitioners to provide professional services. This prohibition against the “corporate practice of medicine” is aimed at preventing corporations such as us from exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of practitioners. While some states have broad exceptions to the corporate practice of medicine, the state licensure statutes and regulations and agency and court decisions that enumerate the specific corporate practice rules vary considerably from state to state and are enforced by both the courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. If regulatory authorities or other parties in any jurisdiction successfully assert that we are engaged in the unauthorized corporate practice of medicine, we could be required to restructure our contractual and other arrangements. Further, violation of these laws may result in sanctions imposed against us, Biote-certified practitioners and/or Biote-partnered clinics through licensure proceedings. Similarly, our compensation arrangement with Biote-certified practitioners and/or Biote-partnered clinics may implicate state fee-splitting prohibitions, which prohibit providers from sharing a portion of their professional fees collected with third parties. Additionally, our relationships with healthcare providers may subject us to HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), which impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of PHI on certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates and their subcontractors that access or otherwise process individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity as well as their covered subcontractors. We could also be subject to analogous state healthcare data privacy laws, which may not always be preempted by HIPAA. We are subject to laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of personally identifiable information about its users around the world. Much of the personal information that we collect is regulated by multiple laws.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the complexity of statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Any action brought against us for violations of these laws or regulations, even if successfully defended, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.
 In a regulatory climate that is uncertain, our operations may be subject to direct and indirect adoption, expansion or reinterpretation of various healthcare laws and regulations. Compliance with these and/or future healthcare laws and regulations may require us to change our practices at an undeterminable and possibly significant initial monetary and annual expense. These additional monetary expenditures may increase future overhead, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, the introduction of new training, and Biote-branded dietary supplements may require us to comply with additional laws and regulations. Compliance may require obtaining appropriate licenses or certificates, increasing our security measures, and expending additional resources to monitor developments in applicable rules and ensure compliance. The failure to adequately comply with these and/or future healthcare laws and regulations may delay or possibly prevent any new training and products from being offered to Biote-certified practitioners, Biote-partnered clinics and their patients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Our success depends on our relationships with Biote-certified practitioners and Biote-partnered clinics, and, therefore, our operations are subject to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws or any other current or future fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations that apply to us, including applicable healthcare fraud statutes, we may be subject to penalties.
Penalties under these laws may be severe, and include without limitation treble damages, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, attorneys’ fees and fines, injunctions, as well as contractual damages and reputational harm. We could also be required to modify, curtail or cease our operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm our business and our financial results and enforcement of the foregoing laws could have a material adverse effect on our business. Also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses.
 Our relationships with Biote-certified practitioners and Biote-partnered clinics in connection with our current and future business activities may be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws and health information privacy and security laws, which could expose us to significant criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.
 Our current and future arrangements with Biote-certified practitioners and Biote-partnered clinics may expose us to broadly applicable federal and state fraud and abuse and other federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain Biote’s business or financial arrangements and relationships.
 Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations may include the following:
 •State healthcare fraud and abuse laws that prohibit any person from offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, for the referral of patients or other items or services to or with licensed healthcare providers, subject to limited exceptions. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, some apply only to state healthcare program payors, while other state laws apply regardless of payor, including funds paid out of pocket by a patient.
 •State corporate practice of “medicine” prohibitions that restrict unlicensed persons from engaging licensed professionals to render professional services to the public or from interfering with or influencing a licensed practitioner’s professional judgment. Certain activities other than those directly related to the delivery of healthcare services to patients may be considered an element of the practice of medicine in many states.
 •State fee-splitting prohibitions, which prohibit licensed healthcare professionals from sharing a portion of their professional fees collected from their professional services with unlicensed third parties.
 •HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on covered entities, which are health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and certain healthcare providers, as those terms are defined by HIPAA, and their respective business associates and their subcontractors, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
 Although Biote does not bill or receive any reimbursement from any third-party payor, to the extent that any Biote-certified practitioners and Biote-partnered clinic with whom we partner accepts health insurance for their services, we could be subject to additional laws, including without limitation the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act and the healthcare fraud provisions of HIPAA.
 Further, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) applies to personal information of consumers, business representatives, and employees, and requires businesses to provide specific disclosures in privacy notices and honor requests of California residents to exercise certain privacy rights. The CCPA provides for civil penalties of up to $7,500 per violation and allows private litigants affected by certain data breaches to recover significant statutory damages. Although the CCPA may exempt some data processed in certain contexts, the CCPA increases compliance costs and potential liability with respect to other personal data we maintain about California residents. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), which became operative on January 1, 2023, expands the CCPA’s requirements, giving California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal data, along with establishing a new regulatory agency to implement and enforce the law. Other states, such as Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut have also passed comprehensive privacy laws, and similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels. While these states, like the CCPA, also exempt some data processed in the context of clinical trials, these developments further complicate compliance efforts, and increase legal risk and compliance costs for us, the third parties upon whom we rely, and our customers.
 Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare and data privacy laws and regulations will involve substantial ongoing costs and may require us to undertake or implement additional policies or measures. The scope of the foregoing state laws and the interpretations of them vary by jurisdiction and are enforced by local courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. We may face claims and proceedings by private parties, and claims, investigations and other proceedings by governmental authorities, relating to allegations that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations, and it is possible that courts or governmental authorities may conclude that our arrangements with the Biote-certified practitioners, Biote-partnered clinics or our sales force are not consistent with such laws, or that we may find it necessary or appropriate to settle any such claims or other proceedings. In connection with any such claims, proceedings, or settlements, we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from
participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. Further, if any Biote-certified practitioners or Biote-partnered clinics with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions.
 If our information technology systems or data is or were compromised, we could experience adverse consequences resulting from such compromise, including, but not limited to, interruptions to our operations, claims that we breached our data protection obligations, decreased use of the Biote Method, loss of Biote-partnered clinics or Biote-certified practitioners or sales, and harm to our reputation.
 Operating our business (including the Biote Method) involves the collection, storage, transmission, disclosure and other processing of proprietary, confidential and sensitive information, as well as the personal information of patients that we may receive from clinics. We may rely upon third-party service providers, such as identity verification and payment processing providers, for our information processing-related activities. We may share or receive sensitive information with or from third parties. In an effort to protect sensitive information, we have implemented security measures designed to protect against security incidents and protect sensitive information. However, advances in information technology capabilities, increasingly sophisticated tools and methods used by hackers, cyber terrorists and other threat actors, new or other developments, and intentional or accidental exposures of sensitive information by those with authorized access to our network, may result in our failure or inability to adequately protect sensitive information. We may expend significant resources or modify our business activities in an effort to protect our information and against security incidents. Certain information privacy and security obligations may require us to implement and maintain specific security measures, industry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect our information technology systems and information.
 We are subject to a variety of evolving threats including, but not limited to, hacking, malware, computer viruses, unauthorized access, phishing or social engineering attacks, ransomware attacks, credential stuffing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, information technology malfunction, software or hardware failures, loss of data, theft of data, misuse of data, telecommunications failures, earthquakes, fire, flood, exploitation of software vulnerabilities, and other real or perceived threats. Any of these incidents could lead to interruptions or shutdowns of our IT systems, loss or corruption of data or unauthorized access to, or disclosure of personal data or other sensitive information. Ransomware attacks, including those from organized criminal threat actors, nation-states and nation-state supported actors, are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe and can lead to significant interruptions, delays, or outages in our operations, loss of data, loss of income, significant extra expenses to restore data or systems, reputational loss and the diversion of funds. To alleviate the financial, operational and reputational impact of a ransomware attack it may be preferable to make extortion payments, but we may be unwilling or unable to do so. Cyberattacks could also result in the theft of our intellectual property, damage to our IT systems or disruption of our ability to make financial reports, and other public disclosures required of public companies. We have been subject to attempted cyber, phishing, or social engineering attacks in the past and may continue to be subject to such attacks and other cybersecurity incidents in the future. If we gain greater visibility, we may face a higher risk of being targeted by cyberattacks. Advances in information technology capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments are likely to result in cyberattacks becoming more sophisticated and more difficult to detect. We and third parties upon whom we rely for our information technology systems and information, may experience such cyberattacks and may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all threats. Moreover, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and may not be known until launched. Security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent actions by our personnel and third-party service providers (including their personnel). Any of the previously identified or similar threats could cause a security incident. A security incident could result in unauthorized, unlawful or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration, encryption, disclosure of or access to information.
 Applicable information privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders of security incidents. Such disclosures are costly, and the disclosures or the failure to comply with such requirements, could lead to adverse impacts. If we (or a third-party upon whom we rely) experience a security incident or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse consequences. These consequences may include: government enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; restrictions on processing data (including personal data); litigation (including class claims); indemnification obligations; negative publicity; reputational harm; monetary fund diversions; interruptions in our operations (including availability of data); financial loss; and other similar harms. Security incidents and attendant consequences may cause Biote-partnered clinics or Biote-certified practitioners to stop using the Biote Method and Biote-branded dietary supplements and may deter new clinics and practitioners from using the Biote Method and Biote-branded dietary supplements and negatively impact our ability to grow and operate our business.
 While we maintain cyber errors and omissions insurance coverage that covers certain aspects of cyber risks, these losses may not be adequately covered by insurance or other contractual rights available to us. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed or are not covered by our insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases
or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Furthermore, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from individuals, privacy advocates, regulators, government agencies, and law enforcement agencies in various jurisdictions with conflicting privacy and security laws. Any disclosure or refusal to disclose personal data may result in a breach of privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, court orders, and regulations and could result in proceedings or actions against us in the same or other jurisdictions, damage to our reputation and brand, and inability to provide our trainings and Biote-branded dietary supplements to clinics and practitioners in certain jurisdictions. Additionally, changes in the laws and regulations that govern our collection, use, and disclosure of certain data could impose additional requirements with respect to the retention and security of customer data, could limit our marketing activities, and have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, brand, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Following the consummation of the Business Combination, we have incurred, and we expect to continue to incur, significant increased expenses and administrative burdens as a public company, which could negatively impact its business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Following the consummation of the Business Combination, we have faced increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses in connection with operation as a public company which Biote did not incur as a private company. Our significantly increased expenses and administrative burdens as a public company could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operation. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), including the requirements of Section 404, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as amended (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, and the securities exchanges, impose additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. Compliance with public company requirements has increased, and may continue to increase, costs and make certain activities more time-consuming. A number of those requirements requires us to carry out activities that Biote has not done previously. For example, we have adopted new charters for our board committees and new internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, expenses associated with SEC reporting requirements and stock exchange listing requirements have been, and will continue to be, incurred. Furthermore, if any issues in complying with those requirements are identified (for example, if the auditors identify a material weakness or significant deficiency in the internal control over financial reporting), we could incur additional costs rectifying those issues, and the existence of those issues could adversely affect our reputation or investor perceptions of it. It may also be more expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance. Risks associated with our status as a public company may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. The additional reporting and other obligations imposed by these rules and regulations may continue to increase legal and financial compliance costs and the costs of related legal, accounting and administrative activities. These increased costs require us to divert a significant amount of money that could otherwise be used to expand the business and achieve strategic objectives. Additionally, advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt additional changes in governance and reporting requirements, which could further increase costs.
 Our internal controls over financial reporting currently do not meet all of the standards contemplated by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and a material weakness resulted in the restatement of previously issued financial statements. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could impair our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations.
 We will eventually be required to provide management’s attestation on internal controls over financial reporting. The standards required for a public company under Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are significantly more stringent than those required of us as a privately held company prior to the Business Combination.
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In the course of preparing our financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our management identified a material weakness in the aggregate in our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, we determined that we did not have appropriate accounting competence and capabilities to properly record in our financial statements certain complex and non-routine accounting issues, particularly related to revenue recognition, financial instruments, and equity. This resulted in incorrect accounting entries that were identified and corrected through the audit of our fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. In addition, this material weakness resulted in errors in the financial statements and related disclosures in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022, which we have restated as described in the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q/A for each of the affected quarters, each filed on March 29, 2023. This material weakness has not been remediated as of the date of this Annual Report.
 In order to remediate this material weakness in the aggregate, we plan to continue to hire personnel with public company experience and provide additional training for our personnel on internal controls as our company continues to grow, and engage external consultants to assist in the development and improvement of methodologies, policies and procedures designed to ensure adequate internal control over financial reporting, including the technical application of U.S. GAAP and evaluating segregation of
duties. Although we believe these measures will remediate this material weakness, there can be no assurance that the material weakness will be remediated on a timely basis or at all, or that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future.
 Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may also become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information.
 As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to re-list on Nasdaq.
 Our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until after we are no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is then documented, designed or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.
 We recently restated our financial statements for certain prior periods, which resulted in unanticipated costs.
As previously announced, we concluded that our previously issued consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022 (the “Affected Periods”) should no longer be relied upon. As a result, we restated the financial statements for the Affected Periods. The restatements of our financial statements for the Affected Periods were due, in part, to an error in the calculation of its earnout valuation, resulting in an overstatement of our earnout liability and our gain (loss) from change in fair value of earnout liability. We also determined that we should attribute changes in fair value of our warrant and earnout liabilities to our operating subsidiary, BioTE Holdings, LLC (“Holdings”), whereas these changes had previously been attributed to the Company in the due to an error related to the calculation of the fair value of our contingent earnout liability in each of the Affected Periods. We determined that attributing these changes in fair value to Holdings more appropriately reflects the economics of the net income allocation to equity interests in our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 810, given our “Up-C” structure. As a result, we corrected the error in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended June 30, 2022 and restated our financial statements for the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022 to reflect a reduction in our basic and diluted income (loss) per common share, as a pro rata portion of gain (loss) from changes in fair value of the warrant and earnout liabilities attributed to noncontrolling interests of Holdings.
 As a result, we incurred unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with the restatements. The restatements may negatively impact the trading price of our securities and make it more difficult for us to raise capital on acceptable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See also “Controls and Procedures.”
 Resales of shares of common stock could depress the market price of our common stock.
 As of December 31, 2022, 69,808,711 shares (which includes 10,000,000 Earnout Voting Shares and 1,587,500 Sponsor Earnout Shares) shares of our common stock are outstanding, consisting of 11,242,887 shares of Class A common stock and 58,565,824 shares of Class V voting stock. Following the Business Combination, shares held by HYAC’s public stockholders have been freely tradeable, and the shares held by the Sponsor and the Members, following their exercise of Exchange Rights, are freely tradeable as of the six-month anniversary of the Closing, subject to applicable securities laws. We have also registered all shares of Class A common stock that we may issue under the Incentive Plan or the ESPP. Once we register these shares, they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to Affiliates. As a result, there may be a large number of shares of Class A common stock sold in the market. These sales of shares of Class A common stock, or the perception of these sales, may depress the market price of our Class A common stock.
 If the benefits from the Business Combination do not meet the expectations of investors, stockholders or financial analysts, the market price of our securities may decline.
 If the benefits from the Business Combination do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of our securities may decline. For example, from the Closing Date through March 15, 2023, our stock price fluctuated from a low of $2.00 to a high of $10.51. Fluctuations in the price of our securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. Immediately prior to the Business Combination, there was not a public market for Biote’s stock and trading in the shares of our Class
A common stock was not active. Accordingly, the valuation ascribed to Biote and our Class A common stock in the Business Combination may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market following the Business Combination. The trading price of our securities could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could adversely affect your investment in our securities, and our securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them. In these circumstances, the trading price of our securities may not recover and may experience a further decline.
 Factors affecting the trading price of our securities following the Business Combination may include:
 •actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;
 •changes in the market’s expectations about our operating results;
 •the public’s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;
 •speculation in the press or investment community;
 •success of competitors;
 •our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;
 •changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning the Biote or the market in general;
 •operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Biote;
 •our ability to market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;
 •changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;
 •commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving the Biote, including the Donovitz Litigation (as defined herein);
 •changes in Biote’s capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;
 •the volume of shares of our Class A common stock available for public sale;
 •our ability to maintain the listing of our securities on Nasdaq;
 •any major change of officers or directors;
 •sales of substantial amounts of Class A common stock by our directors, officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and
 •general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.
 Broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for the stocks of other companies that investors perceive to be similar to Biote could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.
 In the past, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation.
 We are an “emerging growth company” and a “smaller reporting company” and we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies and/or smaller reporting companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.
 We are an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following our initial public offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of
our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.
 If we are unable to maintain our listing on Nasdaq, it could become more difficult to sell our Class A common stock and Public Warrants in the public market.
 Our Class A common stock is listed on Nasdaq. To maintain our listing on this market, we must meet Nasdaq’s listing maintenance standards. On July 20, 2022, Nasdaq suspended trading of our Class A common stock and Public Warrants for failure to meet certain initial listing requirements and indicated it intended to pursue delisting our Class A common stock and Public Warrants once all applicable appeal and review periods expired. On August 25, 2022, Nasdaq approved our application to relist our Class A common stock and Public Warrants and we began trading on August 29, 2022. If we are unable to continue to meet Nasdaq’s listing maintenance standards for any reason, our Class A common stock and Public Warrants could be delisted from Nasdaq. If delisted, we may seek to list our securities on a different stock exchange or, if one or more broker-dealer market makers comply with applicable requirements, the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Listing on such other market or exchange could reduce the liquidity of our Class A common stock and Public Warrants. If our Class A common stock and Public Warrants were to trade in the OTC market, an investor would find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations for the price of, the Class A common stock.
 A delisting from The Nasdaq Global Market and failure to obtain listing on another market or exchange would subject our Class A common stock and Public Warrants to so-called penny stock rules that impose additional sales practice and market-making requirements on broker-dealers who sell or make a market in such securities. Consequently, removal from Nasdaq and failure to obtain listing on another market or exchange could affect the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell or make a market in our Class A common stock and the ability of purchasers of our Class A common stock to sell their securities in the secondary market.
 On March 15, 2023, the closing price of our Class A common stock was $5.15 per share.
 Future resales of Class A common stock may cause the market price of our securities to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.
 The lock-up restrictions agreed to in connection with the A&R IRA have expired, except with respect to the Member Earnout Units, which lock-up restrictions will expire on such later date the Member Earnout Units are earned in accordance with the Business Combination Agreement. As such, each Retained Holdings Unit and corresponding share of Class V voting stock held by the Members (other than the Member Earnout Units) may be redeemed at any time, upon the exercise of such Members’ Exchange Rights, in exchange for either one share of Class A common stock or, at the election of the Company in its capacity as the sole manager of Biote, the cash equivalent of the market value of one share of Class A common stock, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Holdings A&R OA. Assuming the full exercise of the Exchange Rights by all of the Members (including with respect to the Member Earnout Units), the Members would own approximately 83.9% of our Class A common stock, with two such members each beneficially owning 33.4% of our Class A common stock as of December 31, 2022. Except with respect to the Member Earnout Units, the Members are no longer restricted from selling the shares of Class A common stock held by them following their exercise of Members’ Exchange Rights, other than by applicable securities laws.
 In addition, the Sponsor is no longer restricted from transferring, selling, assigning or otherwise disposing of (a) its shares of Class A common stock (other than the Sponsor Earnout Shares, which may not be transferred, sold assigned or otherwise disposed of
until the Sponsor Earnout Shares are earned) or (b) its Private Placement Warrants (as defined herein) (or the underlying shares of Class A common stock) issued pursuant to that certain Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, dated March 1, 2021, by and between the Company and the Sponsor.
 Further we and each of our officers, directors and selling stockholders executed lock-up agreements in which they agreed not to offer, sell, agree to sell, directly or indirectly, or otherwise dispose of any shares of Class A common stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Class A common stock without the prior written consent of the underwriters for a period of 90 days after January 6, 2023, subject to customary exceptions. We do not, however, expect to receive lock-up agreements from any other stockholders, including Dr. Gary Donovitz, who beneficially held 33.2% of shares of our common stock outstanding as of March 15, 2023.
 As such, sales of a substantial number of shares of Class A common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline or increase the volatility in the market price of our Class A common stock.
 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Securities
 Because there are no current plans to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell our Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.
 We may retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and we have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends as a public company in the future will be made at the discretion our Board and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our Class A common stock unless you sell your shares of Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.
 We may require additional capital to support business growth, and if capital is not available to us or is available only by diluting existing stockholders, our business, operating results and financial condition may suffer.
 We require significant capital to continue to develop and grow our business, including with respect to the design, development, marketing, distribution and sale of the Biote Method and Biote-branded dietary supplements. We may need additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available, which could limit our ability to grow and jeopardize our ability to continue our business operations. We fund our capital needs primarily from available working capital; however, the timing of available working capital and capital funding needs may not always coincide, and the levels of working capital may not fully cover capital funding requirements. From time to time, we may need to supplement our working capital from operations with proceeds from financing activities. For instance, on July 27, 2022, we entered into a standby equity purchase agreement (the “SEPA”) with YA II PN, LTD., a Cayman Islands exempt limited partnership (“Yorkville”), whereby we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Yorkville up to 5,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock at our request, subject to terms and conditions specified in the SEPA. We expect to continue to opportunistically seek access to additional funds by utilizing the SEPA.
 To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. The amount of dilution due to equity-based compensation of our employees and other additional issuances could be substantial. Additionally, any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities.
  Further, there can be no assurance that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for any product candidates we may develop and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly, and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could impair our ability to achieve our growth strategy, could harm our financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon our business plans. In addition, there is a risk that our current or future suppliers, service providers, manufacturers or other partners may not survive such difficult economic times, which could directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget. We cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.
Anti-takeover provisions contained in the Charter and Bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.
 Provisions in our Charter and Bylaws, as well as provisions under Delaware law, could make acquiring us more difficult, may limit attempts by stockholders to replace or remove our management, may limit stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the us or our directors, officers, or employees, and may limit the market price of our Class A common stock. These provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.
 Future sales, or the perception of future sales, by the Company or its stockholders in the public market, the issuance of rights to purchase the Company’s Class A common stock, including pursuant to the Incentive Plan and the ESPP, and future exercises of registration rights could result in the additional dilution of the percentage ownership of the Company’s stockholders and cause the market price for the Company’s Class A common stock to decline.
 As of March 15, 2023, 70,320,563 shares (which includes 10,000,000 Earnout Voting Shares and 1,587,000 Sponsor Earnout Shares) of our common stock are outstanding, consisting of 19,707,997 shares of Class A common stock and 50,612,566 shares of Class V voting stock. Assuming the full exercise of the Exchange Rights by all of the Members (including with respect to the Member Earnout Units), and after giving effect to the secondary offering of shares of Class A common stock by certain stockholders pursuant to the registration statement on Form S-1, declared effective by the SEC on January 4, 2023, the Members would have owned approximately 72.0% of our Class A common stock, with one such Member beneficially owning approximately 33.2% of our Class A common stock, as of March 15, 2023. The Members are not restricted from selling the shares of Class A common stock held by them following their exercise of Members’ Exchange Rights, other than by applicable securities laws.
 In addition, we have registered up to 16,651,347 shares of Class A common stock that we may issue under the Incentive Plan and the ESPP. We have registered 5,000,000 shares of Class A common stock for resale related to the SEPA with Yorkville, including 130,559 shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding as of March 15, 2023 and 4,869,441 shares of Class A common stock that may be issued pursuant to the SEPA in the future. Once we issue these shares, they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to Affiliates. As a result, there may be a large number of shares of Class A common stock sold in the market.
 The sale of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, convertible securities or other securities in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for the Company to sell securities in the future at a time and at a price that it deems appropriate.
 In addition, if the Company sells shares of its Class A common stock, convertible securities or other securities, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to the Company’s existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to the holders of the Company’s Class A common stock, including the Company’s Class A common stock issued in connection with the Business Combination.
 Pursuant to the Incentive Plan, the Company is authorized to grant equity awards to its employees, directors and consultants. In addition, pursuant to the ESPP, the Company is authorized to sell shares to its employees. The Company initially reserved 15% of the shares of Class A common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis upon the Closing for future issuance under the Incentive Plan, plus 3,887,750 shares of Class A common stock necessary to satisfy payments to Phantom Equity Holders under the Phantom Equity Acknowledgments (such 3,887,750 shares of Class A common stock will not again become available for issuance under the Incentive Plan and will not be subject to the automatic annual increases described below). In addition, the Company initially reserved 1% of the shares of Class A common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis upon the Closing for future issuance under the ESPP. The Incentive Plan and ESPP provide for annual automatic increases in the number of shares reserved thereunder, beginning on January 1, 2023. As a result of such annual increases, the Company’s stockholders may experience additional dilution, which could cause the price of the Company’s Class A common stock to fall.
 In the future, the Company may also issue its securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of the Company’s then-outstanding shares of Class A common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to the Company’s stockholders.
 We may be subject to periodic claims and litigation, including the Donovitz Litigation (as defined below), that could result in unexpected expenses and could ultimately be resolved against us.
 From time to time, we may be involved in litigation and other proceedings, including matters related to product liability claims, stockholder class action and derivative claims, commercial disputes, copyright infringement, trademark challenges, and other intellectual property claims, as well as trade, regulatory, employment, and other claims related to our business. Any of these proceedings could result in significant settlement amounts, damages, fines, or other penalties, divert financial and management resources, and result in significant legal fees. An unfavorable outcome of any particular proceeding could exceed the limits of our insurance policies or the carriers may decline to fund such final settlements and/or judgments and could have an adverse impact on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our practitioners and clinics and our brand image. The Company is currently involved in the Donovitz Litigation (See Item 3 Legal Proceedings). The outcome of the Donovitz Litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. At this point in time, the Company cannot predict the length of the Donovitz Litigation or the ultimate liability, if any, which may arise therefrom. In addition, litigation and related matters are costly and may divert the attention of the Company’s management and other resources that would otherwise be engaged in other activities.
 Risks Related to our Organizational Structure
 Our only material asset is our ownership interest in Holdings, and accordingly we depend on distributions from Holdings to pay distributions, dividends on our Class A common stock, taxes and other expenses, and make any payments required to be made by us under the Tax Receivable Agreement (the “TRA”).
 We are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of the Holdings Units. We are not expected to have independent means of generating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay distributions, dividends on our Class A common stock, taxes and other expenses, and make any payments required to be made by us under the TRA will be dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of Holdings. The earnings from, or other available assets of, Holdings may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable us to pay any dividends on our Class A common stock or satisfy our other financial obligations. There can be no assurance that Holdings will generate sufficient cash flow to distribute funds to us or that applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including negative covenants under debt instruments, will permit such distributions. If Holdings does not distribute sufficient funds to us to pay our taxes or other liabilities, we may default on contractual obligations or have to borrow additional funds. In the event that we are required to borrow additional funds it could adversely affect our liquidity and subject us to additional restrictions imposed by lenders.
 Holdings will continue to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, generally will not be subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income or loss will be allocated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to the holders of Holdings Units, including us. Accordingly, we will be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on our allocable share of the net taxable income of Holdings. Under the terms of the Holdings A&R OA, Holdings is obligated to make tax distributions to holders of Holdings Units (including us) calculated at certain assumed rates. In addition to tax expenses, we also will incur expenses related to our operations, some of which expenses will be reimbursed by Holdings. We intend to cause Holdings to make ordinary distributions and tax distributions to the holders of Holdings Units on a pro rata basis in amounts sufficient to cover all applicable taxes, relevant operating expenses (to the extent not already payable or reimbursable by Holdings pursuant to the Holdings A&R OA), payments under the TRA and dividends, if any, declared by us. However, as discussed herein, Holdings’ ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions, including, but not limited to, retention of amounts necessary to satisfy the obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries (the “BioTE Companies”) and restrictions on distributions that would violate any applicable restrictions contained in Holdings’ debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering Holdings insolvent. To the extent we are unable to make payments under the TRA for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid, provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period and/or under certain circumstances may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the TRA and therefore accelerate payments under the TRA, which could be substantial.
 Additionally, although Holdings generally will not be subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax, it may be liable under certain U.S. federal income tax legislation for any adjustments to its tax return, absent an election to the contrary. In the event Holdings’ calculations of taxable income are incorrect, Holdings and/or its Members, including us, in later years may be subject to material liabilities pursuant to this U.S. federal income tax legislation and its related guidance. We anticipate that the distributions we receive from Holdings may, in certain periods, exceed our actual liabilities and our obligations to make payments under the TRA. The Board, in its sole discretion, will make any determination from time to time with respect to the use of any such excess cash so accumulated, which may include, among other uses, to pay dividends on our Class A common stock. We will have no obligation to distribute such cash (or other available cash other than any declared dividend) to our public stockholders. We may, if necessary, undertake ameliorative actions, which may include pro rata or non-pro rata reclassifications, combinations, subdivisions or adjustments of outstanding Holdings Units, to maintain one-for-one parity between Holdings Units held by us and shares of our Class A common stock.
 Pursuant to the TRA, we will be required to pay to the Members 85% of the net income tax savings that we realize as a result of increases in tax basis of the BioTE Companies’ assets resulting from the Business Combination and the redemptions of the Retained Holdings Units in exchange for shares of Class A common stock (or cash) pursuant to the Holdings A&R OA and tax benefits related to the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRA, and those payments may be substantial.
 In connection with the Business Combination, the Selling Member will be deemed for U.S. federal (and applicable state and local) income tax purposes to have sold Holdings Units to the Company for the Cash Consideration and rights under the TRA (the “Purchase”) and the Members may in the future have their Holdings Units (including the Earnout Units, if any, that have vested in accordance with the Business Combination Agreement), together with the cancelation of an equal number of shares of Class V voting stock, redeemed in exchange for shares of our Class A common stock (or cash) pursuant to the Holdings A&R OA, subject to certain
conditions and transfer restrictions as set forth therein and in the A&R IRA. These sales and exchanges are expected to result in increases in our allocable share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the BioTE Companies. These increases in tax basis may increase (for income tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions allocable to us and therefore reduce the amount of income or franchise tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future had such sales and exchanges never occurred, although the IRS or any applicable foreign, state or local tax authority may challenge all or part of that tax basis increase, and a court could sustain such a challenge. We have entered into the TRA, which generally provides for the payment by us of 85% of certain net tax benefits, if any, that we realize (or in certain cases are deemed to realize) as a result of these increases in tax basis and tax benefits related to the transactions contemplated under the Business Combination Agreement and the redemption of Retained Holdings Units in exchange for Class A common stock (or cash) pursuant to the Holdings A&R OA and tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRA. These payments are our obligation and are not an obligation of the BioTE Companies. The actual increase in our allocable share of tax basis in the BioTE Companies’ assets, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the TRA, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the market price of the Class A common stock at the time of the exchange and the amount and timing of the recognition of our income. While many of the factors that will determine the amount of payments that we will make under the TRA are outside of our control, we expect that the payments we will make under the TRA will be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Any payments we make under the TRA generally will reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. To the extent that we are unable to make timely payments under the TRA for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid; however, nonpayment for a specified period and/or under certain circumstances may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the TRA and therefore accelerate payments due under the TRA, as further described below. Furthermore, our future obligation to make payments under the TRA could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that may be deemed realized under the TRA.
 In certain cases, payments under the TRA may exceed the actual tax benefits we realize.
 Payments under the TRA will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or another taxing authority may challenge all or any part of the tax basis increases, as well as other tax positions that we take, and a court may sustain such a challenge. In the event that any tax benefits initially claimed by us are disallowed, the Members will not be required to reimburse us for any excess payments that may previously have been made under the TRA, for example, due to adjustments resulting from examinations by the IRS or other taxing authorities. Rather, excess payments made to Members will be applied against and reduce any future cash payments otherwise required to be made to such Members, if any, after the determination of such excess. However, a challenge to any tax benefits initially claimed by us may not arise for a number of years following the initial time of such payment and, even if challenged earlier, such excess cash payment may be greater than the amount of future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the TRA and, as a result, there might not be future cash payments against which such excess can be applied. As a result, in certain circumstances we could make payments under the TRA in excess of our actual income or franchise tax savings, which could materially impair our financial condition.
 In certain cases, payments under the TRA may be accelerated or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the TRA.
 The TRA provides that, in the event that (i) we exercise our early termination rights under the TRA, (ii) certain changes of control occur (as described in the TRA), (iii) we, in certain circumstances, fail to make a payment required to be made pursuant to the TRA by the applicable final payment date, which non-payment continues for 30 days following such final payment date or (iv) we materially breach any of our material obligations under the TRA, which breach continues without cure for 30 days following receipt by us of written notice thereof (unless, in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv), certain liquidity exceptions apply) our obligations under the TRA will accelerate and we will be required to make a lump-sum cash payment to the applicable parties to the TRA equal to the present value of all forecasted future payments that would have otherwise been made under the TRA, which lump-sum payment would be based on certain assumptions, including those relating to our future taxable income. The change of control payment to the Members could be substantial and could exceed the actual tax benefits that we receive as a result of acquiring Holdings Units from the Members because the amounts of such payments would be calculated assuming that we would have been able to use the potential tax benefits each year for the remainder of the amortization periods applicable to the basis increases, and that tax rates applicable to us would be the same as they were in the year of the termination. Decisions made in the course of running our business, such as with respect to mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes in control, may influence the timing and amount of payments that are received by the holders of Retained Holdings Units under the TRA. For example, the earlier disposition of assets following an exchange or acquisition transaction will generally accelerate payments under the TRA and increase the present value of such payments, and the disposition of assets before an exchange or acquisition transaction will increase an existing owner’s tax liability without giving rise to any rights of holders of Retained Holdings Units to receive payments under the TRA. There may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if the payments under the TRA exceed the actual income or franchise tax savings that we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the TRA or if distributions to us by Holdings are not sufficient to permit us to make payments under the TRA after we have paid taxes and other expenses. Furthermore, our obligations to make payments under the TRA could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that are deemed realized under the TRA. We may need to incur additional indebtedness to finance payments under the TRA to
the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the TRA as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
 We may not be able to realize all or a portion of the tax benefits that are expected to result from the acquisition of Retained Holdings Units from Biote Members.
 Pursuant to the TRA, we will share tax savings resulting from (A) the amortization of the anticipated step-up in tax basis in the BioTE Companies’ assets as a result of (i) the Purchase and (ii) the redemption of Retained Holdings Units in exchange for shares of Class A common stock or cash pursuant to the Holdings A&R OA and (B) certain other related transactions with the Members. The amount of any such tax savings attributable to the Purchase and future exchanges will be paid 85% to the applicable Members and retained 15% by us. Any such amounts payable will only be due once the relevant tax savings have been realized by us, unless our obligations under the TRA are accelerated. Our ability to realize, and benefit from, these tax savings depends on a number of assumptions, including that we will earn sufficient taxable income each year during the period over which the deductions arising from any such basis increases and payments are available and that there are no adverse changes in applicable law or regulations. If our actual taxable income were insufficient to fully utilize such tax benefits or there were adverse changes in applicable law or regulations, we may be unable to realize all or a portion of these expected benefits and our cash flows and stockholders’ equity could be negatively affected.
 Risks Related to Taxes
 Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, gross receipts, value added or similar taxes and may successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments or obligations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 The application of indirect taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipts tax, to platform businesses is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the Internet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax obligations and, as a result, amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our business.
 We may face various indirect tax audits in various U.S. jurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes. However, tax authorities may raise questions about or challenge or disagree with our calculation, reporting or collection of taxes and may require us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to remit additional taxes and interest, and could impose associated penalties and fees. For example, after the U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., certain states have adopted, or started to enforce, laws that may require the calculation, collection and remittance of taxes on sales in their jurisdictions, even if we do not have a physical presence in such jurisdictions. A successful assertion by one or more tax authorities requiring us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to collect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we have reserved for potential payments of possible past tax liabilities in our financial statements, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition will be harmed.
 As a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and any such difference may adversely impact our results of operations in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome is determined.
 Unanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 We are subject to income taxes in the United States, and our domestic tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:
 •changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;
 •expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;
 •tax effects of stock-based compensation;
 •costs related to intercompany restructurings;
 •changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; and
 •lower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.

In addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 Increases in our income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 Increases in our income tax rates or other changes in income tax laws in the United States or any jurisdiction in which we operate could reduce our after-tax income and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Existing tax laws in the United States have been, and in the future could be, subject to significant change. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was recently enacted, which includes a one percent excise tax on share buybacks imposed on the corporation repurchasing such stock, effective for tax years beginning after 2022. Future regulatory guidance from taxing authorities or other executive or Congressional actions in the United States or other jurisdictions may be forthcoming. These or other changes in the relevant tax regimes, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 We also will be subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the IRS and other taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income-based taxes. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
