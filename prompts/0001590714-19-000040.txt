Business Overview
Element Solutions, incorporated in Delaware in January 2014, is a leading global specialty chemicals company whose operating businesses formulate a broad range of solutions that enhance the performance of products people use every day. Developed in multi-step technological processes, our businesses' innovative solutions enable customers' manufacturing processes in several key industries, including electronic circuitry, communications infrastructure, automotive systems, industrial surface finishing, consumer packaging and offshore energy. Substantially all of our businesses' products are consumed by our customers as part of their production process, providing us with reliable and recurring revenue streams as the products are replenished in order to continue production. Those customers use our innovation as a competitive advantage, relying on us to help them navigate through fast-paced, high-growth markets. Our product development and product extensions are expected to continue to drive sales growth in both new and existing markets, while expanding margins, by continuing to offer high customer value propositions.
We believe the majority of our businesses hold strong positions in high-growth markets they serve. Our strategy is based on a balance of operational excellence and prudent capital allocation. To that end, our teams focus on commercial execution through strong sales, marketing, product development and supply chain efficiency; while our senior leadership balances holding business teams responsible for operational execution with prioritizing and executing on capital allocation opportunities. In the future, we may pursue targeted and opportunistic acquisitions in our existing and adjacent end-markets that strengthen our current businesses, expand and diversify our product offering, and enhance our growth and strategic position. 
Recent Developments
Closing of the Arysta Sale
On July 20, 2018, we agreed to sell 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Arysta and its subsidiaries to UPL, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Arysta Sale Agreement. The Arysta Sale was completed on January 31, 2019 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4.20 billion in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments relating to, among other things, cash, indebtedness and working capital as of the closing date. The proceeds of the Arysta Sale were primarily used to pay down a portion of our then existing term loan borrowings under the Credit Agreement.
Accordingly, the Agricultural Solutions business is being reported as discontinued operations in this 2018 Annual Report. In connection with the Arysta Sale, we recorded an estimated asset impairment loss in 2018 of $450 million as the carrying value of the Agricultural Solutions' business exceeded its estimated fair value, less costs to sell, primarily due to the recognition of foreign currency translation adjustments previously recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" within Stockholders’ Equity. This charge reflects our best estimate of the impairment loss at this time. The actual loss will be dependent on a number of factors, including foreign exchange rates on the closing date of the sale and other closing adjustments.
Recapitalization
New Credit Agreement
Using the proceeds from the Arysta Sale, we paid down our then existing Credit Facilities, including the First Lien Credit Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility. On the closing date of the Arysta Sale, we also entered into the New Credit Agreement which provides for new senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $1.08 billion, consisting of a revolving facility of $330 million maturing in 2024 and a term loan of $750 million maturing in 2026. The revolving facility includes borrowing capacity in the form of letters of credit of up to $100 million. On the closing date of the Arysta Sale, the $750 million term loan was borrowed under the New Credit Agreement.
Redemption of Prior Senior Notes
Effective on February 1, 2019, all outstanding Prior Senior Notes were redeemed and the Prior Senior Notes Indenture was terminated. This redemption was funded with a portion of the net proceeds from the Arysta Sale and a portion of term loan borrowings under the New Credit Agreement. As of February 1, 2019, our 5.875% senior notes due 2025 remain outstanding.
Share Repurchases
On February 8, 2019, as part of our previously-announced stock repurchase program, we repurchased 37 million shares of our common stock from Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P., advisor to certain Pershing Square investment funds, in a privately-negotiated transaction, for a per share purchase price of $11.72, the last sale price reported for the Company’s shares as of the 4 pm close of trading on the NYSE on Friday, February 1, 2019, or an aggregate purchase price of $434 million. These repurchased shares, which represented approximately 13% of our issued and outstanding common stock, were retired on that date. The repurchase was funded from cash on hand and borrowings under the New Credit Agreement.
Corporate Reorganization and Name Change
Upon the closing of the Arysta Sale, the Company's initiated a corporate reorganization to combine certain corporate functions with those of our former Performance Solutions segment and position the Company best for its next stage.
In this context, effective on the closing date of the Arysta Sale, Rakesh Sachdev retired as Chief Executive Officer while remaining a member of the Board, and Benjamin Gliklich, then Executive Vice President - Operations & Strategy, was appointed as Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Gliklich was also elected to serve as a director of Element Solutions. Additionally, Scot R. Benson, formerly President of our former Performance Solutions segment, was appointed as President and Chief Operating Officer. Finally, Martin E. Franklin, then Chairman of the Board, was named Executive Chairman of the Board.
Effective January 31, 2019, we changed our legal name from "Platform Specialty Products Corporation" to "Element Solutions Inc," and effective February 1, 2019, our shares of common stock began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “NYSE:ESI.”
Simultaneously with this name change, we launched a new corporate website: www.elementsolutionsinc.com. Our investor relations information, including press releases and links to our filings with the SEC, can now be found on this website. The information included on our website does not constitute part of this 2018 Annual Report.

Business Segments
In the fourth quarter, we completed certain changes to our organizational structure that resulted in a change to our reportable business segments. The previously reported Agricultural Solutions segment met the requirements to be classified as discontinued operations and the previously reported Performance Solutions segment was separated into two segments: Electronics and Industrial & Specialty, which represent businesses for which separate financial information is utilized by our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating performance.
Our businesses generate revenue through the formulation and sale of our dynamic chemistry solutions.  Our extensive network of specially-trained scientists and engineers, drawing upon our broad and longstanding intellectual property portfolio and technical expertise, work closely with our customers and OEMs on an ongoing basis to develop proprietary solutions to their manufacturing needs and to ultimately win qualifications and specifications into their supply-chains. We leverage our teams' close relationships to execute our growth strategy by working directly with customers and OEMs to identify opportunities for new product development. Our continuous focus on customer-centric innovation serves as a catalyst to drive specification change and to capitalize on adjacent market opportunities in our industry. 
In addition, our employees provide technical service and support to customers in conjunction with the sale of products in order to optimize functional performance of the processes used at their manufacturing locations. Our businesses' specialty chemicals and processes are seen as integral to their customers’ product performance. We believe that our customers place significant value on the consistency and quality represented by our brands, which we capitalize on through significant market share, customer loyalty and supply chain access. 
In 2018, we achieved sales of $1.96 billion, to which our Electronics and Industrial & Specialty segments each contributed approximately 59% and 41%, respectively. Neither segment is subject to significant seasonality, and both share a common focus on attractive niche markets, which we believe will grow faster than the diverse end-markets each segment serves.

The technical expertise and history of innovation demonstrated by our employees reflect the specialized and highly skilled nature of our research and development personnel. As such, we intend to focus on attracting, retaining and developing the best human capital across all levels of our organization, which is key to our ability to successfully operate and grow our business. 


• | Targeted Acquisitions and Inorganic Growth. Our founder and Executive Chairman, Martin E. Franklin, the other Board members and our executive leadership team have significant experience and expertise, and have been highly successful in acquiring, integrating, and growing businesses. In the future, we may pursue targeted and opportunistic acquisitions in our existing and adjacent end-markets that strengthen our current businesses, expand and diversify our product offerings, and enhance our growth and strategic position. We also expect to achieve commercial and distribution efficiencies by expanding into related categories that can be marketed through our existing distribution channels or provide us with new distribution channels for our existing products. 

Customers
Our businesses have a diverse customer base and sell products either directly to end-user customers or through intermediaries, such as independent, third-party distributors and retailers.  We also have collaborative relationships with many OEMs and industry partners, who specify our chemistries and technologies for use in their products or grant us development rights of their intellectual property. A significant portion of our sales are through such intermediaries.
We rely on independent representatives and distributors to distribute our products and to assist us with the marketing and sale of certain of our products. We believe that we are able to attract new customers successfully through our international reach, coupled with our local knowledge and on-the-ground presence, which enables us to meet the needs of our customers. We operate a relatively large number of small and medium-sized facilities located close to our customers throughout the world's major economic regions. This close proximity to our global customers' local sites enables access to all key growth markets and along with our efficient formulation process, allows for "just in time" supply chain management.
We believe that our business is not materially dependent upon any single customer, with no customer representing 10% or more of our consolidated net sales in 2018, 2017 or 2016.
Due to the relatively short cycle times in our business, our order backlog levels are minimal.
Selling & Marketing 
We employ a customer-centric and highly-technical sales and marketing force worldwide.  These professionals have technical expertise, local market knowledge and intimate customer relationships.  Our local sales and marketing teams closely monitor their market trends and maintain active dialogue with our customers to assess and understand their constantly evolving challenges.  We use this information from our local sales teams to anticipate future needs and respond rapidly to changing market conditions or technologies in order to deliver customized, value-added solutions to our customers, both locally and globally.  This feedback loop is an important source of new product ideas and helps guide our capital allocation decisions and research and development initiatives.
Our methods for selling and marketing our proprietary products vary slightly by geographic region.  In total, we generate business through the efforts of regional sales, technical and service personnel, as well as distributors.  In addition to regional sales and service staff, we maintain a group of global personnel focused on coordinating sales projects and obtaining design specifications for complex projects involving multiple customers within the manufacturing supply chain.
Employees
In order to ensure that innovative products and highly technical service are provided to our customers, we place a premium on maintaining a highly specialized and qualified employee base.  At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 4,450 full-time employees, including approximately 1,900 research and development chemists, experienced technical service and technical sales personnel.  Our full-time employees are based throughout the world, with approximately 80% employed outside of the United States.  
In certain countries where we operate, our employees are also members of unions or are represented by works councils as required by law.  We are required to consult and seek the consent or advice of these unions and/or works councils for any changes to our activities or employee benefits.
Our management believes that our relationships with our employees and collective bargaining unions are satisfactory.
Research and Development
Continued investment in research and development ensures that we remain ahead of emerging trends and that we deliver solutions to strengthen our strong positions in our market niches. Our research and development activities are also focused on developing products and improving formulations and processes that will drive growth or otherwise add value to both our core business operations and customers.  We accelerate market introductions and increase the impact of our product offerings through collaboration with partners in the academic and commercial sectors (customers and value-chain partners) and by working with distributors and OEMs around the world. We plan to continue to make meaningful investments in a broad range of research and development efforts. 
Our commitment to technological innovation and our extensive intellectual property portfolio enables us to develop differentiated products at the forefront of technological advances. Research resulting in new, proprietary formulations is performed principally in Germany, Great Britain, India, Japan, and the United States. During 2018, our research and development expenses totaled $44.3 million. Substantially all research and development activity was performed internally. 
Competitive Environment
Our markets, which are undergoing a consolidation phase, are highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology. Broadly speaking, our businesses compete in the specialty chemicals market.  On a narrower scale, our businesses compete in markets for specialty chemicals for electronic applications, general metal and plastic finishing, offshore oil and gas exploration and production, and printing. 
Our businesses compete primarily on the basis of quality, technology, performance, reliability, brand, reputation, range of products and services, and service and support. We maintain extensive support, technical and testing services for our customers, and are continuously developing new products. Further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment, such as the recent creation of DowDupont Inc., as a result of the merger of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company and The Dow Chemical Company, could result in larger competitors that compete with us on several levels. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to promoting and selling certain products. We believe, however, that our combined abilities to manufacture, sell, service, and develop new products and applications, enable us to compete successfully. Some large competitors operate globally, as we do, but most operate only locally or regionally. We also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete.
The specific competitive environment of each of our segments is described below:
Electronics
Our Electronics segment provides a broad line of proprietary chemical compounds and supporting services, and broadly competes within the specialty chemicals industry. Although competition varies by end-market and geography, our most significant competitors are Atotech Inc., DowDupont Inc., Senju Metal Industry Co. and Uyemura International.
Industrial & Specialty
Our Industrial & Specialty segment provides a broad line of proprietary chemical compounds and supporting services, and broadly competes within the specialty chemicals industry. Although competition varies by end-market and geography, our most significant competitors are Atotech Inc., DowDupont Inc., BP p.l.c. and Flint Group.
Raw Materials and Sourcing of Products
Our businesses involve the formulation of a broad range of specialty chemicals which we create by blending raw materials and incorporating them into multi-step technological processes.  Our operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials on a timely basis.  We typically purchase our major raw materials on an as-needed basis from outside sources. The raw materials that are of greatest importance to our global operations are, in most cases, obtainable from multiple sources worldwide.
Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Products
Our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are important to our business and are protected by a combination of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and other non-patent strategies. We seek intellectual property and other proprietary rights in major markets and other commercially-relevant jurisdictions worldwide. We implement confidentiality procedures and contractual exclusivity and seek other rights necessary to protect our intellectual property, proprietary formulations, processes and other product-related rights.  We rely on confidentiality agreements and patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law as well as judicial enforcement of all of the foregoing to protect our technologies, processes, product composition, formulations and other intellectual property rights. We also enter into invention or patent assignment agreements, when applicable, with our employees, consultants, contractors and other third-parties who may be engaged in discovery or development of intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Finally, we seek to include provisions in our material transfer agreements, license and development agreements and other agreements that provide for the transfer of intellectual property rights back to us to the greatest extent possible under the circumstances of any specific transaction and development project.
At December 31, 2018, we owned, had applications pending, or licensed the rights to approximately 2,200 domestic and foreign patents, which have remaining lives of varying duration.  Although certain of these patents are important to our business, no specific group or groups of intellectual property rights are material.  However, we have many proprietary products which are not covered by patents and which are responsible for a large component of our total sales.  Further, we hold a number of domestic and foreign trade names and trademark registrations which we consider to be of value in identifying our products.
Government and Environmental Regulation
Our businesses develop, produce and market chemical products in a number of jurisdictions throughout the world and are subject to extensive federal, regional, national and local laws and regulations in each country in which we operate. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the Company’s manufacture, use, labeling, packaging, storage and distribution of chemicals and hazardous substances, which are subject to strict quality and regulatory standards. We are required to meet these strict standards which, in recent years, have become increasingly stringent. However, no portion of our business is subject to re-negotiation of profits or termination of material contracts or subcontracts at the election of the governments in the countries in which we operate.
We are subject to the FCPA, which prohibits U.S. persons, U.S. issuers and U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making direct or indirect improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing an improper advantage.   We are also subject to similar anti-bribery laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the Bribery Act, which also prohibits commercial bribery, solicitation of bribery, and makes it a crime for certain commercial organizations to fail to prevent bribery.  These laws are complex and far-reaching in nature and, as a result, we may be required in the future to alter one or more of our policies or practices to be in compliance with these laws or any changes in these laws or the interpretation thereof.
We maintain a Business Conduct and Ethics Policy and a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act/Anti-Corruption Policy, applicable to all our directors, officers and employees. In addition, our CEO and CFO are bound by the provisions of a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers. The Business Conduct and Ethics Policy, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act/Anti-Corruption Policy and the Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers were approved by our Board and cover compliance with the FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws, as well as other legal areas applicable to our operations.
Our businesses and their customers also may be subject to significant requirements under the European Community Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and the Council dated December 18, 2006 relating to the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals, effective June 1, 2007 (or REACH). REACH, adopted in December 2006, imposes obligations on E.U. manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the E.U. to compile and file comprehensive reports, including testing data, on each chemical substance, and perform chemical safety assessments. While we have registered and continue to register substances as required, the registration process is lengthy and registration of certain of our substances may not be immediately effective.  The cost estimates could vary based on the number of substances requiring registration, data availability and cost.  The implementation of the REACH registration process may affect our ability to manufacture and sell certain products in the future.
This highly-regulated environment represents both a challenge (cost, time, risk of failure or non-compliance) and an opportunity (to be more efficient and effective through innovation of compliant and more sustainable solutions than our competitors).  In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the stringency of environmental regulation and enforcement of environmental standards, and the costs of compliance have risen significantly. We expect that the trend of increased regulation will continue in the future. In response to this increased government attention to environmental matters worldwide, we continue to develop proprietary products designed to reduce the discharge of pollutant materials into the environment and eliminate the use of certain 
targeted raw materials while enhancing the efficiency of customer chemical processes. In addition, while regulation substantially increases the time and cost associated with bringing our products to market, we believe that our management team’s significant experience in bringing our and other companies’ technologies through regional, national and local regulatory approval processes, our efficient development process, and our ability to leverage our strategic collaborations to assist with registrations, particularly in Europe and Latin America, will enable us to overcome these challenges. We have and may in the future incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines and sanctions and third-party claims for property or natural resource damage or personal injuries as a result of past or future violations of, or liabilities under, such laws and regulations.  At December 31, 2018, we believe we had appropriate liabilities recorded for our various environmental matters.
