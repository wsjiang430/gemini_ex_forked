 Item 1. Business.
  
  Summary
  
 Seafarer Exploration Corp. ("the Company" or "Seafarer"), a Florida Corporation, was incorporated on May 28, 2003. The Company formerly operated under the name Organetix, Inc. (“Organetix”). The Company's principal business plan is to develop the infrastructure to engage in archaeological research, archaeologically-sensitive exploration, recovery and conservation of historic shipwrecks and to eventually monetize the recovery of the shipwrecks without selling the treasure. The business plan includes in-depth archival research and translation of historical documents from archives and repositories from around the world.
  
 The exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks is by nature speculative, and there is a high degree of risk inherent in this type of business venture. The exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks involves a multi-year, multi-stage process and it may take several years and/or be prohibitively expensive to locate and recover valuable artifacts, if any are ever located at all, from historic shipwreck sites. It is possible that the Company will never locate any valuable artifacts from historic shipwreck sites.
  
 There are a number of other significant challenges and risks regarding this type of business venture that make it risky with potential that the Company could fail. If the Company were to cease its operations, it is likely that there would be complete loss of all capital invested in and/or borrowed by the Company to date.
  
 The Company is also actively researching, exploring and testing new technology to help more accurately understand current and future wreck sites in an unobtrusive manner. Up to the date of this filing, all tests of new and unproven technology and methods have failed. Additional scientists have been hired as consultants to assist in these endeavors.
  
 Additionally, the Company is reviewing a few business opportunities that may allow it to eventually generate revenue streams to support the operational expenses of Seafarer. Seafarer has also acquired a 1% ownership stake in Probability and Statistics, Inc. (P&S) for an exchange of Seafarer’s restricted stock (See Note 5). The Company also has a commission only contract with P&S for any business it brings to P&S. The Company has received a dividend payment from P&S in the amount of $1,500.
       No Revenue and Operating Losses
  
 The Company expects to continue to incur significant operating losses and to generate negative cash flows from operating activities while developing the necessary infrastructure and technology for the actual investigation of historic shipwreck sites. 
  
 The Company’s ability to eliminate operating losses and to generate positive cash flow from operations in the future will depend upon a variety of factors, many of which it is unable to control. Based on our historical rate of expenditures, the Company expects to expend its available cash in less than one month from April 15, 2019. If the Company is unable to implement its business plan successfully, it may not be able to eliminate operating losses, generate positive cash flow, or achieve or sustain profitability, which would materially and adversely affect its business, operations, and financial results, as well as its ability to make payments on its debt obligations, and the Company may be forced to cease its operations.
  
  General
  
 It has been estimated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (“UNESCO”) that there are over three million undiscovered shipwrecks around the world and some of these shipwrecks were lost with verifiable cargoes that contained valuable materials, including artifacts and treasure. However, many of these shipwrecks may have very little archaeological or historical value, and furthermore, a high percentage of these shipwrecks would not have been carrying valuable cargo including artifacts or treasure.
  
 The Company’s principal business plan is to develop the infrastructure and technology to engage in the archaeologically-sensitive exploration, recovery and conservation of historic shipwrecks. Once artifacts have been properly conserved, they will be made available for scientific research and allowed to be displayed for the public.
  
 The Company believes it may eventually be conducting archaeological research around the world and potentially supporting governmental or quasi-governmental organizations, universities and affiliated research groups and private research entities in the documentation and survey of historic shipwrecks based on their discretion. The business plan also includes in-depth archival research and translation of historical documents from various international archives and repositories. These translations of archival research will be made available to the country of origin, the State of Florida, university researchers, and other responsible academic parties upon reasonable request.

 In addition to the research, there is ongoing education of personnel involved in operations with the Company. College level courses in archaeology are being periodically taught in a program to help educate the personnel in context, work methodology, documentation, and conservation. It is the Company’s intent to have the highest educated personnel possible and eventually have all divers certified. The Company works with archaeologists to further insure all sensitive archaeological guidelines are met or exceeded.
  
 The Company in the past has constantly investigated various technologies and non-scientific equipment to help better explore or document our sites. To present date, nothing has been proven to work. The Company will continue to experiment with unproven technologies and will actively work with third parties, consultants and scientists to develop its own proprietary technology which will result in extra expenses to the Company. 
  
 The exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks involves a multi-year, multi-stage process. The reasons for a lengthy permitting process may be due to a number of potential factors including but not limited to requests by permitting agencies for additional information, submitted applications that need to be revised or updated, newly discovered information that needs to be added to an application or agreement, changes to either the agreement or permit terms or revisions to other information contained in the permit, excessive administrative time lags at permitting agencies, etc. The length of time it takes to obtain permits or enter into agreements may cause the Company to expend significant resources while gearing up to do work with little or no visibility as to the timing of receiving a permit. It may take many years and/or be prohibitively expensive to locate, if any are ever located at all, and recover valuable artifacts from historic shipwrecks. Locating and recovering valuable artifacts is very difficult, expensive, and rare. If the Company is not able to locate artifacts or treasure with significant value, then there is high probability that the Company will face adverse consequences.
  
 Underwater recovery operations are inherently difficult and dangerous and may be delayed or suspended by weather, sea conditions or other natural hazards. In addition, even though sea conditions in a particular search location may be somewhat predictable, the possibility exists that unexpected conditions may occur, and already have occurred, that adversely affect the Company’s operations. It is also possible that natural hazards may prevent or significantly delay search and recovery operations.
  
 In addition to natural hazards there may be constant repair and maintenance issues with historic shipwreck exploration and recovery vessels, the Company’s primary exploration vessel is an older vessel that was originally used in other capacities and has been converted for use in historic shipwreck exploration and recovery operations. The repairs, maintenance and upkeep of vessels, is time consuming and has been very expensive and there may be significant periods of vessel down time that results from needed repairs being made or a lack of current financing to make repairs to the vessel.
  
 Furthermore, there are very strict international, federal and state laws that govern the exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks. While the Company has been able to obtain some permits, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to secure future permits or enter into agreements with government agencies in order to explore and salvage historic shipwrecks. There is a risk that government entities may enact legislation that is so strict that any recovery of artifacts and cargo from historic shipwrecks will be nearly impossible. Additionally, permits and agreements with governmental agencies to conduct historic shipwreck exploration and recovery operations are expensive, in terms of both direct costs and ongoing compliance costs. It is also entirely possible that the Company will not be successful in obtaining title or permission to excavate certain wrecks. It is possible that permits that are sought for potential future international projects may never be issued, and if issued, may not be legal or honored by the entities that issued them.
  
 Obtaining permits and entering into agreements with governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to conduct historic shipwreck exploration and recovery operations is generally a very complex, time consuming, and expensive process. Furthermore, the process of entering into agreements and/or obtaining permits may be subject to lengthy delays, possibly in excess of a year. Some governmental agencies may refuse to issue permits to the Company for recovery of artifacts or intentionally delay the permitting process.
  
 The reasons for a lengthy permitting process may be due to a number of potential factors including but not limited to requests by permitting agencies for additional information, submitted applications that need to be revised or updated, newly discovered information that needs to be added to an application or agreement, changes to either the agreement or permit terms or revisions to other information contained in the permit, excessive administrative time lags at permitting agencies, etc. The length of time it takes to obtain permits or enter into agreements may cause the Company to expend significant resources while gearing up to do work with little or no visibility as to the timing of receiving a permit.
  
 Even if the Company is able to obtain permits for shipwreck projects, there is a possibility that the shipwrecks may have already been salvaged, may not be located, or may not have had anything valuable on board at the time that they sank. It is the Company’s intent to find shipwrecks where available research suggests there were not any previous recovery efforts or past recovery efforts failed or were not completed. In the event that valuable artifacts are located and recovered, it is possible that the cost of recovery will exceed the value of the artifacts recovered. It is also possible that other entities, including both private parties and governmental entities, will assert conflicting claims and challenge the Company’s rights to the recovered artifacts.

 Moreover, there is the possibility that should the Company be successful in locating and recovering artifacts that have significant archeological and/or monetary value, that a country whose ship was salvaged may attempt to claim ownership of the artifacts by pursuing litigation. In the event that the Company is able to make a valid claim to artifacts or other items at a shipwreck site, there is a risk of theft of such items at sea, both before or after the recovery or while the artifacts are in transit to a safe destination, as well as when stored in a secured location. Such thefts may not be adequately covered by insurance. Based on a number of these and other potential issues the Company could spend a great deal of time and invest a large sum in a specific shipwreck project and receive very little or no salvage claim or revenue for its work. The Company does have plans for security at sea, however it may never implement such plans.
  
 There are a number of significant issues and challenges including, but not limited to, government regulation and/or the Company’s inability to secure permits and contracts, lack of financing, lack of revenue and cash flow and continued losses from operations that make the exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks a speculative business venture. There is also significant expense involved in research and ongoing educational programs. Research expenses involve paying scientists for translations, and research dues and fees for various historical entities such as archives, travel and accommodations, and research materials.
  
  There is currently a limited trading market for our securities. We cannot assure when and if an active-trading market in our shares will be established, or whether any such market will be sustained or sufficiently liquid to enable holders of shares of our common stock to liquidate their investment in our company. The ability to deposit restricted shares has also become increasingly more difficult during the year ended December 31, 2018. Furthermore, the sale of unregistered and restricted securities by current shareholders, including shares issued to consultants and shares issued to settle convertible promissory notes and to settle debt, may cause a significant drop in the market prices of the Company’s securities. Also, because the Company primarily finances the operations with the sale of securities, an increase to the authorized shares may need to be done from time to time.
  
 Accordingly, an investment in Seafarer’s securities is speculative and extremely risky and should only be considered by those investors who do not require liquidity and who can afford to suffer a total loss of their investment. An investor should consult with professional advisers before making an investment in our securities.
  
  Competition
  
 There are a number of competing entities who are engaged in various aspects of the exploration and salvage of historic shipwrecks, and in the future other competitors may emerge. Some of these companies are publicly traded companies and there are a number of small private companies, as well as some loosely affiliated groups and individuals, who claim to be in this business as well. Some of these entities may be better capitalized and may have greater resources to devote to the pursuit of locating and salvaging historic shipwrecks. Many of these competing entities may also have significantly more experience than the Company in the exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks. The Company is at a material competitive disadvantage as compared to competing entities that are better capitalized, have more resources and/or who possess greater experience in the business.  
  
  Lack of Revenues and Cash Flow/Significant Losses from Operations
  
 The exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks requires a multi-year, multi-stage process and it may be many years before any revenue is generated from exploration and recovery activities, if ever. Without significant revenues and cash flow the Company does not have reliable cash flow to pay its expenses. The Company relies on outside financing in the form of equity and debt and it is possible that the Company may not be able to obtain outside financing in the future. If the Company is not able to obtain financing it would more than likely be forced to cease operations and all of the capital that has been invested in or borrowed by the Company would be lost. 
  
 In addition, the expenses associated with operating a small publicly traded company engaged in the historic shipwreck recovery business are exorbitantly high. The cost of operations may include the cost of buying or leasing a vessel, regular vessel maintenance and upkeep, ongoing vessel repairs due to wear and tear and damage by natural or human causes, docking fees, fuel, upgrades, equipment costs, personnel costs, insurance, registration costs, permitting, temporary lodging and provisions for divers and other personnel, etc. In addition to the operations expenses, a publicly traded company also incurs the significant recurring costs of maintaining publicly traded status, which include, but are not limited to administrative, accounting, audit, executive, legal, etc. These combined expenses are particularly burdensome for a smaller public company. The recurring expenses associated with being a publicly traded company focused on the exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks may cause the Company to be at a significant competitive disadvantage when compared to some of its competitors who are private companies or public companies who are not fully reporting.
  
 If the Company is unable to secure additional financing or meaningful revenues, our business may fail or our operating results and our stock price may be materially adversely affected. The raising of additional financing would in all likelihood result in dilution or reduction in the value of the Company’s securities.

  The Company may not be able to continue as a going concern. If the Company is not able to continue as a going concern, it is highly likely that all capital invested in the Company or borrowed by the Company will be lost. As discussed in Note 2 to our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have experienced operating losses in every year since our inception resulting in an accumulated deficit. Based on our financial results as of December 31, 2018, there are substantial doubts about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is not able to continue as a going concern, it is likely that all capital invested in the Company or borrowed by the Company will be lost.
  
 The Company has experienced a net loss in every fiscal year since inception. The Company’s net losses from were $1,277,184 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $999,847 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company believes that it will continue to generate losses from its operations for the foreseeable future and the Company may not be able to generate a profit in the long-term, or ever. 
  
  Governmental Regulation
  
 There are very strict international, federal and state laws that govern the exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to secure permits or enter into agreements with government agencies in order to explore and recover historic shipwrecks, although the Company has secured permits in the past. There is a substantial risk that government entities may enact legislation that is so strict that any recovery of artifacts and cargo from historic shipwrecks will be nearly impossible. Additionally, permits and agreements with governmental agencies to conduct historic shipwreck exploration and recovery operations are expensive, both in terms of direct and ongoing compliance costs. It is possible that permits that are sought for potential future international projects may never be issued, and if issued, may not be legal or honored by the entities that issued them.
  
 The laws and regulations regarding the exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks in waters controlled by the State of Florida are complex. A large amount of time and expense is required to comply with the existing laws and regulations. The State of Florida has, in the past, proposed new rules and regulations regarding the exploration and recovery of shipwrecks in Florida waters. The Company believes any new rules and regulations that are implemented into law would likely increase the cost of compliance and potentially force the Company to cease its operations. It is possible that the State of Florida may enact additional laws that ultimately make it impossible to conduct business as a commercial shipwreck exploration and recovery firm. It may also be possible that the State of Florida attempts to enact legislation which altogether bans the commercial exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks in State controlled waters.
  
 There is a possibility that new governmental regulations could be enacted at any time at the international, federal or state level that would make it impossible for the Company to continue to attempt to locate and salvage historic shipwrecks. Governmental regulation at all levels may substantially increase the costs and expenses incurred by the Company to obtain permits and agreements and comply with the regulations and represent a significant risk to the Company and all companies engaged in the commercial exploration and recovery of historical shipwrecks. There is a possibility that governmental regulation could be enacted that would make it impossible for the Company to conduct commercial exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks anywhere in the world.
  
 There are also strict environmental regulations associated with the exploration and recovery of historical shipwrecks. In order to explore and salvage shipwrecks that are located in state controlled waters, the Company must obtain permission from both federal authorities and state environmental agencies in order to conduct operations. There is always the possibility that the Company could be denied access to a historic shipwreck site based on federal or state environmental concerns
  
  Litigation
  
 The Company has been engaged in various litigations (See “Item 3 Legal Proceedings” below). We could be subject to future litigations, although none are known or expected, that could materially affect our ability to operate our business, which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition, which the Company does not foresee and none currently exist. 
 Historic Shipwreck Exploration and Recovery in Florida
  
 The Company operates year-round, but the best diving for historic shipwreck exploration and recovery in Florida waters is generally considered to be the summer months, from approximately the middle of April through October, although good weather conditions may allow operations to extend into the fall and winter months at certain historic shipwreck sites. Inclement weather and hazardous ocean conditions may hamper year round historical shipwreck exploration and recovery efforts in Florida waters. It is the Company’s intention to work continuously all year, as in years past.

 Other factors that may hinder the Company’s ability to conduct year round operations include a lack of financing, the expiration of permits and agreements or the need to renew or enter into permits and agreements with various governmental or quasi-governmental agencies, and the inability to locate and retain skilled, competent and experienced personnel. Permits were renewed in Area 1 and Area 2 of Melbourne Beach for a period of 3 years. During down times, the Company's operations personnel may, among other duties, spend time researching sites, reviewing site plans, maps, charts, and other related information and performing maintenance, overhaul, cleaning, etc.
  
  Juno Beach Shipwreck Site
  
 The Company has previously performed some exploration and recovery operations at what it believes to be a shipwreck site located off of the coast of Florida in northern Palm Beach County, more specifically in an area known as “Juno Beach” (the “Juno Beach Shipwreck”). The Company had previously obtained a recovery permit from the State of Florida for the Juno Beach site. The recovery permit expired in April of 2014. In March of 2015, Seafarer was awarded full rights to the Juno site pursuant to a court order, erasing all rights of the Company’s previous partner with regards to the site. The Juno site was arrested permanently to Seafarer by the U.S. Marshal’s offices in July 7 of 2017 and in November 2017 the Company was granted final judgment on its federal admiralty claim for the Juno Beach shipwreck site (See Item 3 below). The Company is preparing to attempt to renew the permit, however there is no guarantee that a renewal permit will be issued to the Company.
  
 The Company believes it is possible the Juno Beach shipwreck site may potentially contain remnants of a sunken 1500s era ship; however, the Company does not have definitive evidence of the ship’s country of origin. Due to the fact that the Company does not currently have sufficient data to positively identify the potential Juno Beach shipwreck, or its country of origin, it is not possible to determine whether or not the ship was originally carrying cargo of any significant value. To date the Company has not located the main body of a shipwreck at the Juno Beach site, only a lot of shipwreck material and remnants including pottery, porcelain, cannon balls, musket balls, ballast stones, nails, spikes, wood and scattered pieces of a sunken ship.
  
 The Company has determined that a large portion of the magnetometer survey of the Juno Beach Shipwreck site, that was previously given to the Company and to the State of Florida by the Company’s past partner on the site, was intentionally deleted from the survey. The Company will complete a magnetometer survey of the entire deleted area when certain conditions are met. There is also possibility that there are no artifacts of significant value located at the Juno Beach shipwreck site. Even if there are valuable artifacts and/or treasure located at the site, recovering them may be difficult due to a variety of challenges that include, but are not limited to; inclement weather, hazardous ocean conditions, large amounts of sand that cover large areas of the site, lack of the necessary equipment to be able to dig deep enough into the sand, etc.
  
  North Florida Shipwreck Site
  
 There is a purported historic shipwreck site in the waters off of Brevard County Florida that the Company desires to investigate. In February 2013, the Company signed an agreement with a third party who has previously explored this site for the right to investigate the site. In March of 2014, Seafarer entered into a partnership and ownership with Marine Archaeology Partners, LLC, with the formation of Seafarer’s Quest, LLC. Such LLC was formed in the State of Florida for the purpose of permitting, exploration and recovery of artifacts from a designated area on the east coast of Florida. Such site area is from a defined, contracted area by a separate entity, which a portion of such site is designated from a previous contracted holding through the State of Florida. Under such agreement, Seafarer is responsible for costs of permitting, exploration and recovery, and is entitled to 60% of such artifact recovery. Seafarer has a 50% ownership, with designated management of the LLC coming from Seafarer. There are a significant number of challenges inherent in the exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks, including the possibility that the Company will never find artifacts of value at the site.
  
 In July of 2014, Seafarer’s Quest, LLC received a 1A-31 Exploration Permit with a Dig and Identify modification (the “Permit”) from the Florida Division of Historical Resources for an area identified as Area 2 off of Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Permit was active for three years from the date of issuance. Seafarer on behalf of Seafarer’s Quest, LLC, has been primarily focusing its operations on this site when the weather permits. In addition to the Company’s main salvage vessel, the Company has utilized additional owned and rented vessels in order to perform search and identify operations at this site. Inclement weather and difficult sea conditions have hampered the Company’s ability to perform exploration operations at this site to date. An archeologist with the technical skills, knowledge, and experience from around the world was hired to help insure the integrity of the work. The Company has applied for permits from the State of Florida for two additional areas that were formerly permitted solely by an affiliate of Marine Archeological Partners, LLC. The Permit for one of the additional areas was given to the Company on July 6, 2016 and identified as Area 1. Both permits in Area 1 and Area 2 have been renewed in 2019 for an additional 3 years.

 The Company regularly reviews opportunities to perform exploration and recovery operations at purported historic shipwreck sites; however, the Company does have specific plans to perform exploration and recovery operations at other shipwreck sites at the present time. The Company is actively reviewing other potential historic shipwreck sites for possible exploration and recovery. Should the Company decide that it will pursue exploration and recovery activities at other potential shipwreck sites it may be necessary to obtain recovery permits as well as environmental permits.
  
  Certain Agreements
  
  Agreement to Explore a Shipwreck Site Located off of Brevard County, Florida
  
  In March of 2014, Seafarer entered into a partnership and ownership with Marine Archaeology Partners, LLC, with the formation of Seafarer’s Quest, LLC. Such LLC was formed in the State of Florida for the purpose of permitting, exploration and recovery of artifacts from a designated area on the east coast of Florida. Such site area is from a defined, contracted area by a separate entity, which a portion of such site is designated from a previous contracted holding through the State of Florida. Under such agreement, Seafarer is responsible for costs of permitting, exploration and recovery, and is entitled to 60% of such artifact recovery. Seafarer has a 50% ownership, with designated management of the LLC coming from Seafarer. As of December 31, 2018, the partnership has had no operations. Seafarer is responsible for managing the site on behalf of the partnership.
 Florida Division of Historical Resources Agreements/Permits
  
 The Company successfully renewed its permits for both Areas 1 and 2 for the Melbourne Beach site. The Area 2 permit was renewed on January 14, 2019 for a period of three years. The Area 1 permit was renewed on March 1, 2019 for a period of three years.
 Federal Admiralty Judgement
  
 As previously noted on its form 8-K filed on November 22, 2017, Seafarer was granted, through the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, a final judgment for its federal admiralty claim on the Juno Beach shipwreck site.
 Agreement with Probability and Statistics, Inc.
  
 Seafarer acquired a 1% ownership position in Probability and Statistics, Inc. (P&S) for an exchange of shares of Seafarer’s restricted common stock.
