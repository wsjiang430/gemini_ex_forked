ITEM 1. BUSINESS
All references to “Notes” throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Overview
Phillips Edison & Company, Inc. (“we,” the “Company,” “our,” or “us”) is an internally-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that is one of the nation’s largest owners and operators of grocery-anchored shopping centers. Additionally, we operate an investment management business providing property management and advisory services to third-party owned grocery-anchored real estate.
Our portfolio primarily consists of well-occupied, grocery-anchored neighborhood and community shopping centers having a mix of national, regional, and local retailers providing necessity-based goods and services in strong demographic markets throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we managed a diversified portfolio of 340 shopping centers, 303 of which are wholly-owned by us and comprised approximately 34.4 million square feet located in 32 states.
We were formed as a Maryland corporation in October 2009 and have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Substantially all of our business is conducted through Phillips Edison Grocery Center Operating Partnership I, L.P. (“Operating Partnership”), a Delaware limited partnership formed in December 2009. We are a limited partner of the Operating Partnership, and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Phillips Edison Grocery Center OP GP I LLC, is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. The majority of our revenues are lease revenues derived from our owned real estate investments.
On November 16, 2018, we completed a $1.9 billion merger (the “Merger”) with Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT II, Inc. (“REIT II”), a public non-traded REIT that was advised and managed by us. The 100% stock-for-stock transaction created an approximately $6 billion internally-managed REIT focused exclusively on grocery-anchored shopping centers. We also acquired an interest in a joint venture through the Merger (see Note 3 for more detail).
On November 9, 2018, we entered into a joint venture agreement with The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company (“Northwestern Mutual”), one of the nation’s largest and most experienced commercial real estate investors, to create Grocery Retail Partners I LLC (“GRP I” or the “GRP I joint venture”). Under the terms of the GRP I joint venture, Northwestern Mutual acquired an 85% interest in 17 high-quality grocery-anchored shopping centers, previously owned and operated by us, with an aggregate fair value of approximately $359 million. We retained a 15% ownership in the portfolio while providing asset management and property management services to GRP I.
On October 4, 2017, we completed a transaction valued at approximately $1 billion to acquire certain real estate assets and the third-party investment management business of Phillips Edison Limited Partnership (“PELP”) in exchange for stock and cash (the “PELP transaction”). See Note 4 for more detail.
Business Objectives and Strategies
Our business objective is to own, operate, and manage well-occupied, grocery-anchored shopping centers that generate cash flows to support distributions to our stockholders and that have the potential for capital appreciation. We seek to achieve this objective through our focus on leasing, merchandising, and efficient property management within our wholly-owned portfolio; strategic acquisitions and capital recycling; and investment management activities. Altogether, our goal is to provide great grocery-anchored shopping experiences and improve our communities one center at a time.
Focus on Growth in Our Wholly-Owned Portfolio—We believe our focus on the following areas will lead to growth in our portfolio and improved return for our investors: 

• | Protecting Our Core Investment—We add value by overseeing all aspects of operations at our properties. Our property managers maintain a local presence in order to effectively manage operating costs while maintaining a pleasant, clean, and safe environment where retailers can be successful and customers can enjoy their shopping experience. We utilize our effective accounting, billing, and tax review platform to facilitate our daily operations.


• | Leasing—Our national footprint of experienced leasing professionals is dedicated to (i) creating the optimal merchandising mix for a center, (ii) increasing occupancy at our centers, (iii) maximizing rental income by capitalizing on below-market rent opportunities within our portfolio, (iv) increasing rents as leases expire, and (v) executing leases with contractual rent increases.


• | Redevelopment—Our team of seasoned professionals identifies opportunities to unlock additional value at our properties through our redevelopment program. Our redevelopment strategies include outparcel construction, footprint reconfiguration, anchor repositioning, and anchor expansion, among others. We expect these opportunities to increase the overall yield and value of our properties, which will allow us to generate higher returns for our stockholders while creating great grocery-anchored shopping center experiences.

Capital Recycling and Strategic Acquisitions—We continually evaluate opportunities to recycle capital through the disposition of assets. The disposition of assets that we believe have achieved their maximum value, potentially have lower future growth profiles, or have higher retailer risk provides us with capital to strengthen our balance sheet or to pursue assets with higher growth opportunities. The recycled capital allows us to purchase assets located in attractive demographic markets throughout the United States where our management believes our fully-integrated operating platform can add value and create growth.

Investment Management Activities—Our investment management business utilizes the in-house experience of owning and operating grocery-anchored shopping centers to generate revenue by providing comprehensive real estate and asset management services to third-party funds, including (i) Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT III, Inc. (“PECO III”), a non-traded publicly registered REIT currently raising up to $1.5 billion dollars in equity; (ii) three institutional joint ventures, and (iii) one private fund. Collectively, the assets under management for these external funds totaled approximately $680 million as of December 31, 2018. Our investment management business will expand our platform and relationships while preserving our balance sheet and will afford us the opportunity to consider acquisitions in the future similar to what we have done historically.
Joint Ventures—We participate in certain joint venture opportunities which we feel are beneficial to our stockholders over the long-term. We have contributed certain assets to two joint ventures with well-respected institutional investors, where we maintain an ownership interest in the assets while maintaining operational control at the property level and generating fees from services. This provides us opportunities to increase our revenue and share in a portion of the potential capital appreciation of a given property.
Conservative Balance Sheet—Our goal is to preserve a flexible yet conservative capital structure, while maintaining a focus on driving stockholder returns. We believe it is critical to have access to multiple forms of capital, including common stock, unsecured debt, bank debt, and mortgage debt, to maximize availability and minimize our overall cost of capital. We believe maintaining a conservative balance sheet with an appropriately staggered debt maturity profile positions the Company well for long-term growth.
Competition
We are subject to significant competition in seeking real estate investments and tenants. We compete with many third parties engaged in real estate investment activities including other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, hedge funds, and other persons. Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have greater financial resources than we do and may potentially enjoy competitive advantages that result from, among other things, increased access to capital, lower cost of capital, and enhanced operating efficiencies. In addition to these entities, we also face competition from smaller landlords and companies at the local level in seeking tenants to occupy our shopping centers. In these local markets, we seek to attract potential tenants and retain existing tenants from the same tenant base as do local landlords and entities of varying sizes. This further increases the number of competitors we have and the type of competition that we face in seeking to execute on our business objectives and strategies. 
Segment Data
As of December 31, 2017, we operated through two business segments: Owned Real Estate and Investment Management. Following the Merger, we determined, as of December 31, 2018, we have one reportable segment. Our segment disclosures have been updated to reflect this change.
Environmental Matters
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state, and local governments. Compliance with federal, state, and local environmental laws has not had a material, adverse effect on our business, assets, results of operations, financial condition, and ability to pay distributions, and we do not believe that our existing portfolio will require us to incur material expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations.
Corporate Headquarters and Employees
Our corporate headquarters, located at 11501 Northlake Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45249, is where we conduct a majority of our management, leasing, construction, and investment activities, as well as administrative functions such as accounting and finance. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 300 employees.
