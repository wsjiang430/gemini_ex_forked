Business


Overview
 
We supply advanced, innovative capital equipment developed for the global semiconductor industry. Fabricators of advanced integrated circuits, or chips, can use our single-wafer wet-cleaning tools in numerous steps to improve product yield, even at increasingly advanced process nodes. We have designed these tools for use in fabricating foundry, logic and memory chips, including dynamic random-access memory (or DRAM) and 3D NAND-flash memory chips. We also develop, manufacture and sell a range of advanced packaging tools to wafer assembly and packaging customers.
 
Selling prices for our single-wafer wet-cleaning tools range from $2 million to more than $5 million. Revenue from single-wafer wet-cleaning tools totaled $68.5 million, or 92% of total revenue, in 2018 and $27.1 million, or 74% of total revenue, in 2017. Our customers for single-wafer wet-cleaning tools include Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, Shanghai Huali Microelectronics Corporation, SK Hynix Inc. and Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., Ltd.
 
We focus our selling efforts on establishing a referenceable base of leading foundry, logic and memory chip makers, whose use of our products can influence decisions by other manufacturers. We believe this customer base will help us penetrate the mature chip manufacturing markets and build credibility with additional industry leaders. Using a “demo-to-sales” process, we have placed evaluation equipment, or “first tools,” with a number of selected customers. Since 2009 we have delivered more than 55 single-wafer wet cleaning tools, more than 50 of which have been accepted by customers and thereby generated revenue to us and the balance of which are awaiting customer acceptance should contractual conditions be met.
 
Since our formation in 1998, we have focused on building a strategic portfolio of intellectual property to support and protect our key innovations. Our wet-cleaning equipment has been developed using our key proprietary technologies:
 
   ●
 Space Alternated Phase Shift, or SAPS, technology for flat and patterned wafer surfaces. Introduced in 2009, SAPS technology employs alternating phases of megasonic waves to deliver megasonic energy in a highly uniform manner on a microscopic level. We have shown SAPS technology to be more effective than conventional megasonic and jet spray technologies in removing random defects across an entire wafer as node sizes shrink from 300nm to 20nm and lower.

   ●
 Timely Energized Bubble Oscillation, or TEBO, technology for patterned wafer surfaces at advanced process nodes. Introduced in March 2016, TEBO technology has been developed to provide effective, damage-free cleaning for 2D and 3D patterned wafers with fine feature sizes. We have demonstrated the damage-free cleaning capabilities of TEBO technology on patterned wafers for feature nodes as small as 1xnm (16nm to 19nm), and we have shown TEBO technology can be applied in manufacturing processes for patterned chips with 3D architectures having aspect ratios as high as 60-to-1.

   ●
 Tahoe technology for cost and environmental savings. Introduced in August 2018, Tahoe technology delivers high cleaning performance using significantly less sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide than is typically consumed by conventional high-temperature single-wafer cleaning tools.


We have been issued more than 220 patents in the United States, the People’s Republic of China or PRC, Japan, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.
 
We conduct substantially all of our product development, manufacturing, support and services in the PRC. All of our tools are built to order at our manufacturing facilities in Shanghai, which encompass 86,000 square feet of floor space for production capacity. Our experience has shown that chip manufacturers in the PRC and throughout Asia demand equipment meeting their specific technical requirements and prefer building relationships with local suppliers. We will continue to seek to leverage our local presence to address the growing market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in the region by working closely with regional chip manufacturers to understand their specific requirements, encourage them to adopt our SAPS, TEBO and Tahoe technologies, and enable us to design innovative products and solutions to address their needs.

Our Technology and Product Offerings
 
 Single Wafer Wet Cleaning Equipment for Front End Production Processes
 
Chip fabricators can use our single-wafer wet-cleaning tools in numerous steps to improve product yield during the front-end production process, during which individual devices are patterned in the chip prior to being interconnected on the wafer. Based on our review of third-party reports and other information, we estimate that the global market for single wafer wet cleaning tools will increase from $3.1 billion in 2018 to $4.3 billion in 2023, representing a compound annual growth rate of 6.8%. We estimate our Ultra-C SAPS, TEBO and Tahoe product offerings address approximately 50% of this market.
 
Our wet-cleaning equipment has been developed using our proprietary SAPS, TEBO and Tahoe technologies, which allow our tools to remove random defects from a wafer surface effectively, without damaging a wafer or its features, even at an increasingly advanced process nodes (the minimum line widths on a chip) of 22 nanometers, or nm, or less. We use a modular configuration that enables us to create a wet-cleaning tool meeting the specific requirements of a customer, while using pre-existing designs for chamber, electrical, chemical delivery and other modules. Our modular approach supports a wide range of customer needs and facilitates the adaptation of our model tools for use with the optimal chemicals selected to meet a customer’s requirements. Our tools are offered principally for use in manufacturing chips from 300mm silicon wafers, but we also offer solutions for 150mm and 200mm wafers and for nonstandard substrates, including compound semiconductor, quartz, sapphire, glass, and plastics.
 
SAPS Technology, Applications and Equipment
 
 SAPS Technology
 
SAPS technology delivers megasonic energy uniformly to every point on an entire wafer by alternating phases of megasonic waves in the gap between a megasonic transducer and the wafer. Radicals for removing random defects are generated in dilute solution, and the radical generation is promoted by megasonic energy. Unlike “stationary” megasonic transducers used by conventional megasonic cleaning methods, SAPS technology moves or tilts a transducer while a wafer rotates, enabling megasonic energy to be delivered uniformly across all points on the wafer, even if the wafer is warped. The mechanical force of cavitations generated by megasonic energy enhances the mass transfer rate of dislodged random defects and improves particle removal efficiency.
 
By delivering megasonic energy in a highly uniform manner on a microscopic level, SAPS technology can precisely control the intensity of megasonic energy and can effectively remove random defects of all sizes across the entire wafer in less total cleaning time than conventional megasonic cleaning products, without loss of material or roughing of wafer surfaces. We have conducted trials demonstrating SAPS technology to be more effective than conventional megasonic and jet spray cleaning technologies as defect sizes shrink from 300nm to 20nm and below. These trials show that SAPS technology has an even greater relative advantage over conventional jet spray technology for cleaning defects between 50 and 65nm in size, and we expect the relative benefits of SAPS will continue to apply in cleaning even smaller defect sizes.
 
 SAPS Applications
 
SAPS megasonic cleaning technology can be applied during the chip fabrication process to clean wafer surfaces and interconnects. It also can be used to clean, and lengthen the lifetime of recycled test wafers.
 
Wafer Surfaces. SAPS technology can enhance removal of random defects following planarization and deposition, which are among the most important, and most repeated, steps in the fabrication process:
 
   ●
 Post CMP: Chemical mechanical planarization, or CMP, uses an abrasive chemical slurry following other fabrication processes, such as deposition and etching, in order to achieve a smooth wafer surface in preparation for subsequent processing steps. SAPS technology can be applied following each CMP process to remove residual random defects deposited or formed during CMP.

   ●
 Post Hard Mask Deposition: As part of the photolithographical patterning process, a mask is applied with each deposition of a material layer to prevent etching of material intended to be retained. Hard masks have been developed to etch high aspect-ratio features of advanced chips that traditional masks cannot tolerate. SAPS technology can be applied following each deposition step involving hard masks that use nitride, oxide or carbon based materials to achieve higher etch selectivity and resolution.

For these purposes, SAPS technology uses environmentally-friendly dilute chemicals, reducing chemical consumption. Chemical types include dilute solutions of chemicals used in RCA cleaning, such as dilute hydrofluoric acid and RCA SC-1 solutions, and, for higher quality wafer cleaning, functional de-ionized water produced by dissolving hydrogen, nitrogen or carbon dioxide in water containing a small amount of chemicals, such as ammonia. Functional water removes random defects by generating radicals, and megasonic excitation can be used in conjunction with functional water to further increase the generation of radicals. Functional water has a lower cost and environmental impact than RCA solutions, and using functional water is more efficient in eliminating random defects than using dilute chemicals or de-ionized water alone. We have shown that SAPS megasonic technology using functional water exhibits high efficiency in removing random defects, especially particles smaller than 65nm, with minimal damage to structures.
 
Interconnects and Barrier Metals. Each successive advanced process node has led to finer feature sizes of interconnects such as contacts, which form electrical pathways between a transistor and the first metal layer, and vias, which form electrical pathways between two metal layers. Advanced nodes have also resulted in higher aspect ratios for interconnect structures, with thinner, redesigned metal barriers being used to prevent diffusion. SAPS technology can improve the removal of residues and other random defects from interconnects during the chip fabrication process:
 
   ●
 Post Contact/Via Etch: Wet etching processes are commonly used to create patterns of high-density contacts and vias. SAPS technology can be applied after each such etching process to remove random defects that could otherwise lead to electrical shorts.

   ●
 Pre Barrier Metal Deposition: Copper wiring requires metal diffusion barriers at the top of via holes to prevent electrical leakage. SAPS technology can be applied prior to deposition of barrier metal to remove residual oxidized copper, which otherwise would adhere poorly to the barrier and impair performance.


For these applications, SAPS technology uses environmentally friendly dilute chemicals such as dilute hydrofluoric acid, RCA SC-1 solution, ozonated de-ionized water and functional de-ionized water with dissolved hydrogen. These chemical solutions take the place of piranha solution, a high-temperature mixture of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide used by conventional wet wafer cleaning processes. We have shown that SAPS technology exhibits greater efficiency in removing random defects, and lower levels of material loss, than conventional processes, and our chemical solutions are less expensive and more environmentally conscious than piranha solution.
 
Recycled Test Wafers. In addition to using silicon wafers for chip production, chip manufacturers routinely process wafers through a limited portion of the front-end fabrication steps in order to evaluate the health, performance and reliability of those steps. Manufacturers also use wafers for non-product purposes such as inline monitoring. Wafers used for purposes other than manufacturing revenue products are known as test wafers, and it is typical for twenty to thirty percent of the wafers circulating in a fab to be test wafers. In light of the significant cost of wafers, manufacturers seek to re-use a test wafer for more than one test. As test wafers are recycled, surface roughness and other defects progressively impair the ability of a wafer to complete tests accurately. SAPS technology can be applied to reduce random defect levels of a recycled wafer, enabling the test wafer to be reclaimed for use in additional testing processes. For these purposes, SAPS technology includes improved fan filter units that balances intake and exhaust flows, precise temperature and concentration controls that ensure better handling of concentrated acid processes, and two-chemical recycle capability that reduces chemical consumption.
 
 SAPS Equipment
 
 
We currently offer two principal models of wet wafer cleaning equipment based on our SAPS technology, Ultra C SAPS II and Ultra C SAPS V. Each of these models is a single-wafer, serial-processing tool that can be configured to customer specifications and, in conjunction with appropriate dilute chemicals, used to remove random defects from wafer surfaces or interconnects and barrier metals as part of the chip front-end fabrication process or for recycling test wafers. By combining our megasonic and chemical cleaning technologies, we have designed these tools to remove random defects with greater efficacy and efficiency than conventional wafer cleaning processes, with enhanced process flexibility and reduced quantities of chemicals. Each of our SAPS models was initially built to meet specific requirements of a key customer. The sales prices of our SAPS tools generally range between $2.5 million and $5.0 million, although the sales price of a particular tool will vary depending upon the required specifications.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEBO Technology, Applications and Equipment 



 TEBO Technology
 
We developed TEBO technology for application in wet wafer cleaning during the fabrication of 2D and 3D wafers with fine feature sizes. TEBO technology facilitates effective cleaning even with patterned features too small or fragile to be addressed by conventional jet spray and megasonic cleaning technologies.
 
TEBO technology solves the problems created by transient cavitation in conventional megasonic cleaning processes. Cavitation is the formation of bubbles in a liquid, and transient cavitation is a process in which a bubble in fluid implodes or collapses. In conventional megasonic cleaning processes, megasonic energy forms bubbles and then causes those bubbles to implode or collapse, blasting destructive high-pressure, high-temperature micro jets toward the wafer surface. Our internal testing has confirmed that at any level of megasonic energy capable of removing random defects, the sonic energy and mechanical force generated by transient cavitation are sufficiently strong to damage fragile patterned structures with features less than 70nm.

TEBO technology provides multi-parameter control of cavitation by using a sequence of rapid changes in pressure to force a bubble in liquid to oscillate at controlled sizes, shapes and temperatures, rather than implode or collapse. As a result, cavitation remains stable during TEBO megasonic cleaning processes, and a chip fabricator can, using TEBO technology, apply the level of megasonic energy needed to remove random defects without incurring the pattern damage created by transient cavitation in conventional megasonic cleaning.
 
We have demonstrated the damage-free cleaning capabilities of TEBO technology on customers’ patterned wafers as small as 1xnm (16nm to 19nm), and we believe TEBO technology will be applicable in even smaller fabrication process nodes. TEBO technology can be applied in manufacturing processes for conventional 2D chips with fine features and advanced chips with 3D structures, including Fin Field Effect Transistors or FinFET, DRAM, 3D NAND and 3D cross point memory, and we expect it will be applicable to other 3D architectures developed in the future, such as carbon nanotubes and quantum devices. As a result of the thorough, controlled nature of TEBO processes, cleaning time for TEBO-based solutions may take longer than conventional megasonic cleaning processes. Conventional processes have proven ineffective, however, for process nodes of 20nm or less, and we believe the increased yield that can be achieved by using TEBO technology for nodes up to 70nm can more than offset the cost of the additional time in utilizing TEBO technology.
 
 TEBO Applications
 
At process nodes of 28nm and less, chip makers face escalating challenges in eliminating nanometric particles and maintaining the condition of inside pattern surfaces. In order to maintain chip quality and avoid yield loss, cleaning technologies must control random defects of diminishing killer defect sizes, without roughing or otherwise damaging surfaces of transistors, interconnects or other wafer features. TEBO technology can be applied in numerous steps throughout the manufacturing process flow for effective, damage-free cleaning:
 
   ●
 Memory Chips: We estimate that TEBO technology can be applied in as many as 50 steps in the fabrication of a DRAM chip, consisting of up to 10 steps in cleaning ISO structures, 20 steps in cleaning buried gates, and 20 steps in cleaning high aspect-ratio storage nodes and stacked films.

   ●
 Logic Chips: In the fabrication process for a logic chip with a FinFET structure, we estimate that TEBO technology can be used in 15 or more cleaning steps.


For purposes of solving inside pattern surface conditions for memory or logic chips, TEBO technology uses environmentally friendly dilute chemicals such as RCA SC-1 and hydrogen gas doped functional water.
 
 TEBO Equipment
 
We currently offer two models of wet wafer cleaning equipment based on our TEBO technology, Ultra C TEBO II and Ultra C TEBO V. Each of these models is a single-wafer, serial-processing tool that can be configured to customer specifications and, in conjunction with appropriate dilute chemicals, used at numerous manufacturing processing steps for effective, damage-free cleaning of chips at process nodes 28nm or less. TEBO equipment solves the problem of pattern damage caused by transient cavitation in conventional jet spray and megasonic cleaning processes, providing better particle removal efficiency with limited material loss or roughing. TEBO equipment currently is being evaluated by a select group of leading memory and logic chip customers, some of which recently have indicated an intent to move to production. The sales prices of our TEBO tools generally range between $3.5 million and $6.5 million, although the sales price of a particular tool will vary depending upon the required specifications.
 
Each model of TEBO equipment includes:
 
 
● an equipment front-end module, or EFEM, which moves wafers from chamber to chamber; ● one or more chamber modules, each equipped with a TEBO megasonic generator system; ● an electrical module to provide power for the tool; and ● a chemical delivery module. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tahoe Overview
 
Our Ultra-C Tahoe wafer cleaning tool can deliver high cleaning performance using significantly less sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide than is typically consumed by conventional high-temperature single-wafer cleaning tools. During normal single-wafer cleaning processes, only a fraction of the acid reacts with the wafer surface, while the majority is wasted as acid spins off the wafer and cannot be recycled. In addition to providing cost savings resulting from vastly reduced acid consumption, Ultra-C Tahoe meets the needs of customers who face increased environmental regulations and demand new, more environmentally-friendly tools. We announced our first purchase order for an Ultra C Tahoe tool in August 2018, and we delivered the tool to a strategic customer in January of 2019.
 
 Single-Wafer Tools for Back-End Assembly and Packaging
 
We leverage our technology and expertise to provide a range of single-wafer tools for back-end wafer assembly and packaging factories. We develop, manufacture and sell a wide range of advanced packaging tools, such as coaters, developers, photoresist strippers, scrubbers, wet etchers and copper-plating tools. We focus on providing custom-made, differentiated equipment that incorporates customer-requested features at a competitive price. Selling prices for these tools range from approximately $500,000 to more than $2 million.
 
 
For example, our Ultra C Coater is used in applying photoresist, a light-sensitive material used in photolithography to transfer a pattern from a mask onto a wafer. Coaters typically provide input and output elevators, shuttle systems and other devices to handle and transport wafers during the coating process. Unlike most coaters, the Ultra C Coater is fully automated. Based on requests from customers, we developed and incorporated the special function of chamber auto-clean module into the Ultra C Coater, which further differentiates it from other products in the market. The Ultra C Coater is designed to deliver improved throughput and more efficient tool utilization while eliminating particle generation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our other advanced packaging tools include: Ultra C Developer, which applies liquid developer to selected parts of photoresist to resolve an image; Ultra C PR Megasonic-Assisted Stripper, which removes photoresist; Ultra C Scrubber, which scrubs and cleans wafers; and Ultra C Thin Wafer Scrubber, which addresses a sub-market of cleaning very thin wafers for certain Asian assembly factories; and Ultra C Wet Etcher, which etches silicon wafers and copper and titanium interconnects.
 
Our Customers
 
 As of December 31, 2018, chip fabricators had purchased and deployed more than 55 of our single-wafer wet cleaning tools. To date, all of our sales of single-wafer wet cleaning equipment for front-end manufacturing have been to customers located in Asia, and we anticipate that a substantial majority of our revenue from these products will continue to come from customers located in this region for the near future. We have increased our efforts to penetrate the markets in North America and Western Europe, and we believe we are well positioned to begin generating sales in those regions.
 
We generate most of our revenue from a limited number of customers as the result of our strategy of initially placing single-wafer wet cleaning equipment with a small number of leading chip manufacturers that are driving technology trends and key capability implementation. In 2018, 85.7% of our revenue was derived from three customers: Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., Ltd., a leading PRC memory chip company, together with one of its subsidiaries, accounted for 38.8% of our revenue; Shanghai Huali Microelectronics Corporation, a leading PRC foundry, accounted for 23.6% of our revenue; and SK Hynix Inc., a leading Korean memory chip company, accounted for 23.3% of our revenue. In 2017, 55.2% of our revenue was derived from four customers: SK Hynix Inc. accounted for 18.1% of our revenue; Shanghai Integrated Circuit Research and Development Center Ltd., a public research consortia for the Chinese semiconductor industry, accounted for 14.1% of our revenue; JiangYin ChangDian Advanced Packaging Co. Ltd., a leading PRC foundry, accounted for 12.8% of our revenue; and Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., Ltd., together with one of its subsidiaries, accounted for 10.2% of our revenue.
 
Based on our market experience, we believe that implementation of our single-wafer wet cleaning equipment by one of our selected chip manufacturers will attract and encourage other manufacturers to evaluate our equipment, because the leading company’s implementation will serve as validation of our equipment and could enable the other manufacturers to shorten their evaluation processes. We placed our first SAPS tool in 2009 as a prototype. We worked closely with the customer for two years in debugging and modifying the tool, and the customer then spent two more years of qualification and running pilot production before beginning volume manufacturing. Our revenue in 2015 included sales of SAPS tools following the customer’s completion of its qualification process. We believe that the period from new product introduction to high volume manufacturing could range from one to several years.
 
For our back-end wafer assembly and packaging customers, we focus on providing custom-made, differentiated single wafer wet cleaning equipment that incorporates a customer’s requested features at a competitive price. Our primary customers of these products in 2018 included: Deca Technologies, a wafer-level interconnect foundry with headquarters in Arizona and manufacturing in the Phillipines that is a majority-owned, independent subsidiary of Cypress Semiconductor Corp.; JiangYin ChangDian Advanced Packaging Co. Ltd., a leading PRC foundry that is also one of the largest customers of our front end of line equipment; Nantong Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd., a PRC-based chip assembly and testing company that is a subsidiary of Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd.; and Wafer Works Corporation, a leading wafer supplier based in the PRC.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We market and sell our products worldwide using a combination of our direct sales force and third-party representatives. We employ direct sales teams in Asia, Europe and North America, and have located these teams near our customers, primarily in the PRC, Korea, Taiwan and the United States. Each sales person has specific local market expertise. We also employ field application engineers, who are typically co-located with our direct sales teams, to provide technical pre- and post-sale support tours and other assistance to existing and potential customers throughout the customers’ fab planning and production line qualification and fab expansion phases. Our field application engineers are organized by end markets as well as core competencies in hardware, control system, software and process development to support our customers.

To supplement our direct sales teams, we have contacts with several independent sales representatives in the PRC, Taiwan and Korea. We select these independent representatives based on their ability to provide effective field sales, marketing forecast and technical support for our products. In the case of representatives, our customers place purchase orders with us directly rather than with the representatives.
 
Our sales have historically been made using purchase orders with agreed technical specifications. Our sales terms and conditions are generally consistent with industry practice, but may vary from customer to customer. We seek to obtain a purchase order two to four months ahead of the customer’s desired delivery date. For some customers, we receive a letter of intent three weeks ahead, followed by the corresponding purchase order five weeks ahead, of the customer’s desired delivery date. Consistent with industry practice, we allow customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice. Because of our relatively short delivery period and our practice of permitting rescheduling or cancellation, we believe that backlog is not a reliable indicator of our future revenue.
 
Our marketing team focuses on our product strategy and technology road maps, product marketing, new product introduction processes, demand assessment and competitive analysis, customer requirement communication and public relations. Our marketing team also has the responsibility to conduct environmental scans, study industry trends and arrange our participation at major trade shows.
 
Manufacturing
 
All of our products are built to order at our Shanghai facilities. Our first manufacturing facility has a total of 36,000 square feet, with 8,000 square feet of class 10,000 clean room space for product assembly and testing, plus 800 square feet of class 1 clean room space for product demonstration purposes. The rest of the area is used for product sub-assembly, component inventory and manufacturing related offices. A class designation for a clean room denotes the number of particles of size 0.5mm or larger permitted per cubic foot of air. Our manufacturing facility is ISO-9000 certified, and we have implemented certain manufacturing science-based factory practices such as constraint management, statistical process control and failure mode and effect analysis methodology.
 
In September 2018, we began production at our second factory, located ten miles from our Shanghai headquarters. The new facility provides an additional 50,000 square feet of floor space for production capacity. We plan to shift an increasing portion of our future production to this factory based on its modernized capabilities.
 
We purchase some of the components and assemblies that we include in our products from single source suppliers. We believe that we could obtain and qualify alternative sources to supply these components. Nevertheless, any prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We depend on a limited number of suppliers, including single source suppliers, for critical components and assemblies, and our business could be disrupted if they are unable to meet our needs.”
 
Research and Development
 
We believe that our success depends in part on our ability to develop and deliver breakthrough technologies and capabilities to meet our customers’ ever-more challenging technical requirements. For this reason, we devote significant financial and personnel resources to research and development. Our research and development team is comprised of highly skilled engineers and technologists with extensive experience in megasonic technology, cleaning processes and chemistry, mechanical design, and control system design. To supplement our internal expertise, we also collaborated with external research and development entities such as International SEMATECH, a global consortium of computer chip manufacturers, on specific areas of interests and retain, as technical advisors, several experts in semiconductor technology.

For the foreseeable future we are focusing on enhancing our Ultra C SAPS, TEBO and Tahoe tools and integrating additional capabilities to meet and anticipate requirements from our existing and potential customers. Our particular areas of focus include development of the following:
 
   ●
 new cleaning steps for Ultra C SAPS cleaners for application in logic chips and for DRAM, 3D NAND and 3D cross point memory technologies;

   ●
 new cleaning steps for Ultra C TEBO cleaners for FinFET in logic chips, gates in DRAM, and deep vias in both 3D NAND and 3D cross point memory technologies;

   ●
 new hardware, including new system platforms, new and additional chamber structures and new chemical blending systems; and

   ●
 new software to integrate new functionalities to improve tool performance.


Longer term, we are working on new proprietary process capabilities based on our existing tool hardware platforms. We are also working to integrate our tools with third-party tools in adjacent process areas in the chip manufacturing flow. Our research and development expense totaled $10.4 million, or 13.9% of revenue in 2018 and $5.1 million, or 14.1% of revenue in 2017. We intend to continue to invest in research and development to support and enhance our existing cleaning products and to develop future product offerings to build and maintain our technology leadership position.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success and future revenue growth depend, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We control access to and use of our proprietary technologies, software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, consultants, advisors, customers, partners and suppliers. We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures, to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. All employees and consultants are required to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment and consulting relationships with us. We also require them to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived or made in connection with the employment or consulting relationship.
 
We have aggressively pursued intellectual property since our founding in 1998. We focus our patent efforts in the United States, and, when justified by cost and strategic importance, we file corresponding foreign patent applications in strategic jurisdictions such as the European Union, the PRC, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. Our patent strategy is designed to provide a balance between the need for coverage in our strategic markets and the need to maintain costs at a reasonable level.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 20 issued patents, and 20 patents pending, in the United States. These patents carry expiration dates from 2022 through 2038. Many of the US patents and applications have also been filed internationally, in one or more of the European Union, PRC, Japan, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. Specifically, we own patents in wafer cleaning, electro-polishing and plating, wafer preparation, and other semiconductor processing technologies. We have been issued more than 220 patents in the United States, the People’s Republic of China or PRC, Japan, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.
 
We currently manufacture advanced single-wafer cleaning systems equipped with our SAPS, TEBO and Tahoe technologies. Our wafer cleaning technologies are protected by US Patent Numbers 8580042, 8671961, 9070723 and 9281177, as well as their corresponding international patents. We have 31 patents granted internationally protecting our SAPS technologies. We also have filed 9 international patent applications for key TEBO technologies, and 2 for Tahoe, in accordance with the Patent Cooperation Treaty, in anticipation of filing in the U.S. national phase.
 
In addition to the above core technologies, we have technologies for stress-free polishing, or SFP, and electrochemical plating, or ECP, that are used in certain of our tools. SFP is an integral part of the electro polishing process. Our technology was a breakthrough in electro-chemical-copper-planarization technology when it was first introduced, because it can polish, stress-free, copper layers used in copper low-K interconnects. Our innovations in SFP and ECP are reflected in US Patent Numbers 6638863 and 8518224, and their corresponding international counterparts.

We also have technologies in other semiconductor processing areas, such as wafer preparation and some specific processing steps. The wafer preparation technology is covered by US Patent Numbers 8383429 and 9295167. The specific processing steps includes US Patent Number 8598039 titled “Barrier layer removal method and apparatus.”
 
To date we have not granted licenses to third parties under the patents described above. Not all of these patents have been implemented in products. We may enter into licensing or cross-licensing arrangements with other companies in the future.
 
We cannot assure you that any patents will issue from any of our pending applications. Any rights granted under any of our existing or future patents may not provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us. With respect to our other proprietary rights, it may be possible for third parties to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology or marks without authorization or to develop similar technology independently.
 
The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions, which have resulted in often protracted and expensive litigation. We may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. In addition, we may in the future initiate litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or the rights of our customers or to protect our trade secrets.
 
Our customers could become the target of litigation relating to the patent or other intellectual property rights of others. This could trigger technical support and indemnification obligations in some of our customer agreements. These obligations could result in substantial expenses, including the payment by us of costs and damages related to claims of patent infringement. In addition to the time and expense required for us to provide support or indemnification to our customers, any such litigation could disrupt the businesses of our customers, which in turn could hurt our relations with our customers and cause the sale of our products to decrease. We do not have any insurance coverage for intellectual property infringement claims for which we may be obligated to provide indemnification.
 
Additional information about the risks relating to our intellectual property is provided under “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.”
 
Competition
 
The chip equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly competitive throughout the world. We compete with semiconductor equipment companies located around the world, and we may also face competition from new and emerging companies, including new competitors from the PRC. We consider our principal competitors to be those companies that provide single-wafer cleaning products to the market, including Beijing Sevenstar Science & Technology Co., Ltd., DNS Electronics LLC, Lam Research Corp., Mujin Electronics Co., Ltd., SEMES Co. Ltd. and Tokyo Electron Ltd.
 
Compared to our company, our current and potential competitors may have:
 
   ●
 better established credibility and market reputations, longer operating histories, and broader product offerings;

   ●
 significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, which may allow them to pursue design, development, manufacturing, sales, marketing, distribution and service support of their products;
 
   ●
 more extensive customer and partner relationships, which may position them to identify and respond more successfully to market developments and changes in customer demands; and

   ●
 multiple product offerings, which may enable them to offer bundled discounts for customers purchasing multiple products or other incentives that we cannot match or offer.


The principal competitive factors in our market include:
 
   ●
 performance of products, including particle removal efficiency, rate of damage to wafer structures, high temperature chemistry, throughput, tool uptime and reliability, safety, chemical waste treatment, and environmental impact;

   ●
 service support capability and spare parts delivery time; innovation and development of functionality and features that are must-haves for advanced fabrication nodes;

   ●
 ability to anticipate customer requirements, especially for advanced process nodes of less than 45nm; ability to identify new process applications;

   ●
 brand recognition and reputation; and

   ●
 skill and capability of personnel, including design engineers, manufacturing engineers and technicians, application engineers, and service engineers.


In addition, semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new equipment into semiconductor production lines. Some manufacturers began fabricating chips for the 10nm node in 2017 and the 7nm node in 2018, and we have one customer that currently is evaluating implementation of our equipment at these nodes. Once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production, the manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application and technology node as long as the supplier’s products demonstrate performance to specification in the installed base. Accordingly, we may experience difficulty in selling to a given manufacturer if that manufacturer has qualified a competitor’s equipment. If, however, that cleaning equipment constrains chip yield, we expect, based on our experience to date, that the manufacturer will evaluate implementing new equipment that cleans more effectively.
 
We focus on the high-end fabrication market with advanced nodes, and we believe we compete favorably with respect to the factors described above. Most of our competitors offer single-wafer cleaning products using jet spray technology, which has relatively poor particle removal efficiency for random defects less than 30nm in size and presents increased risk of damage to the fragile patterned architectures of wafers at advanced process nodes. Certain of our competitors offer single-wafer cleaning products with megasonic cleaning capability, but we believe these products, which use conventional megasonic technology, are unable to maintain energy dose uniformity on the entire wafer and often lack the ability to repeat the requisite uniform energy dose wafer to wafer in production, resulting in poor efficiency in removing random defects, longer processing time and greater loss of material. In addition, these conventional megasonic products generate transient cavitation, which results in more incidents of damage to wafer structures with feature sizes of 70nm or less. We design our cleaning tools equipped with our proprietary SAPS, TEBO and Tahoe technologies, which we believe offer better performance, much less chemical consumption, and lower cost of consumables, including at advanced process nodes of 22nm or less.
