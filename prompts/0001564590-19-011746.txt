Company Overview
 Cool Holdings is a company focused on premium retail brands.  Currently, our business is comprised of OneClick®, a chain of 16 retail consumer electronics stores authorized under the Apple® Premier Partner, APR (Apple® Premium Reseller) and AAR MB (Apple® Authorized Reseller Mono-Brand) programs, and Cooltech Distribution, an authorized distributor to the OneClick® stores and other resellers of Apple® products and other high-profile consumer electronic brands.  During 2018, we discontinued our verykool® brand of Android-based wireless handsets, tablets and related products the Company sold to carriers, distributors and retailers in Latin America. 
 We incorporated under the laws of the State of California on February 7, 1994, under the name InfoSonics Corporation. On September 11, 2003, we reincorporated under the same name under the laws of and into the State of Maryland.  On June 8, 2018, we changed our name to Cool Holdings, Inc.  Our corporate headquarters are in Miami, Florida.
 On March 12, 2018, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company, Cooltech Holding Corp. (“Cooltech”), and the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, InfoSonics Acquisition Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), Cooltech merged with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger”), with Cooltech surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  As discussed in Note 17, because of the change of control that resulted from the Merger, it was treated as a reverse merger with Cooltech deemed to be acquiring InfoSonics for accounting purposes.  Therefore, the Company’s historical financial statements prior to the Merger reflect those of Cooltech.
 During 2018, the Company conducted two fundraising transactions in which it raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $8.9 million.  In June 2018, the Company sold 885,000 common shares, 298,000 preferred shares and warrants to raise $3.7 million, and in October and November 2018 it sold convertible notes and warrants to raise $5.2 million.
 In August 2018, the Company exercised an option to acquire the assets of a chain of seven retail electronics stores in the Dominican Republic referred to as the “Unitron Assets.”  The Option Agreement, as amended, was issued on January 5, 2018 as part of the Company’s Merger with Cooltech.  The Option Agreement provided that upon exercise of the Option by the Company, the Cooltech shareholders at the date of the merger would receive 625,000 shares of the Company’s common stock that was originally carved out of the Merger consideration when the Unitron acquisition had to be unwound as a result of the inability to produce pre-acquisition audited financial statements.
 During August and September 2018, the Company conducted debt exchanges in which it converted an aggregate of approximately $12.5 million of outstanding promissory notes and other accrued liabilities into 3,400,000 common shares and warrants to substantially deleverage its balance sheet.
 Reportable Segments and Geographic Areas
 We operate our business in two segments: our OneClick retail stores and our Cooltech Distribution business.  Within the OneClick store segment, our stores operate in three geographies: United States (3 stores in Florida), Argentina (6 stores) and the Dominican Republic (7 stores).  Financial information about our segments is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 14, "Segments," of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Store Operations, Merchandise and Seasonality
 As an Apple Premier Partner, we work with Apple to develop our network of OneClick stores in locations and markets where Apple has limited or no presence.  Our stores are generally located in high-traffic or local neighborhood strip centers or shopping malls.  In our stores, we sell all Apple and Apple-approved products and accessories, including accessories that we source from independent third parties.  We also provide repair service for Apple products and are one of the select authorized third-parties that Apple entrusts with its proprietary machines used to repair or replace damaged iPhone screens.  Retail customers may book a repair appointment at one of our OneClick stores directly through the Apple website.  Our OneClick business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with a large portion of our sales and operating profit realized during the fourth calendar quarter of the year.

Our Cooltech Distribution unit distributes various consumer electronics to resellers, retailers and small and medium-sized businesses in Latin America and the United States.  We market and distribute a variety of mobility, computing, audio/video, and other technology products including laptops, tablets, cell phones, drones, smart watches, gaming consoles, accessories and audio devices.  In addition to our direct relationship with Apple, we have direct relationships with top third-party brands in the Apple retail echo-system including Bose, Belkin, Speck, Tech21 and Thule, among others.
 Purchasing and Suppliers
 The majority of our product purchases are of Apple products, which we buy both directly from Apple as well as from two tier one distributors facilitated by our license agreements with Apple.  We also have direct relationships with approximately 6 accessory manufacturers and purchase other accessories from distributors.  We believe that maintaining and strengthening our relationships with Apple and our other vendors is essential to our operations and continued expansion.
Competition
 The consumer electronics and accessory industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. We compete with mass merchants such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Target, and regional chains; specialty computer product and consumer electronics stores; and online retailers such as Amazon.  We also technically compete with Apple-owned stores and Apple’s online store.  However, Apple does not own any stores in Argentina and the Dominican Republic, where the majority of our stores are located.
Sustainability
 We are committed to sustainability and to operating our business in a manner that results in a positive impact to the environment and our communities. Through our trade-in programs, we buy back or take in used consumer electronics that are otherwise destined for landfills and either refurbish them or recycle them. In addition, we continuously look for cost-effective ways to reduce our carbon emissions.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 178 full-time salaried and hourly employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are members of a collective bargaining unit.
