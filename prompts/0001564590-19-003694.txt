Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to developing potentially transformative gene therapies for severe genetic diseases and cancer. With our lentiviral-based gene therapy and gene editing capabilities, we have built an integrated product platform with broad therapeutic potential in a variety of indications. We believe that gene therapy for severe genetic diseases has the potential to change the way patients living with these diseases are treated by addressing the underlying genetic defect that is the cause of their disease, rather than offering treatments that only address their symptoms. Our clinical programs in severe genetic diseases include our LentiGlobin® product candidate as a treatment for transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia, or TDT, and sickle cell disease, or SCD, and our Lenti-D™ product candidate as a treatment for cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, or CALD. Our programs in oncology are built upon our leadership in lentiviral gene delivery and T cell engineering, with a focus on developing novel T cell-based immunotherapies, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and T cell receptor (TCR) T cell therapies. bb2121 and bb21217, our clinical-stage product candidates in oncology, are CAR T cell product candidates for the treatment of multiple myeloma. 
 We are developing our LentiGlobin product candidate for different genotypes of TDT and for SCD in the United States and the European Union, or EU.  Both TDT and SCD are rare, hereditary blood disorders that often lead to severe anemia and shortened lifespans.  In October 2018, we announced that the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has accepted for review our marketing authorization application, or MAA, for our LentiGlobin product candidate for the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with TDT and non-β0/β0 genotypes. If we receive conditional approval in 2019, we expect to launch LentiGlobin in Europe and begin to generate product revenues. We plan to file a biologics license application, or BLA, in the United States in 2019 for the use of LentiGlobin in the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with TDT and non-β0/β0 genotypes. We are also engaged with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the EMA in discussions regarding our proposed development plans for LentiGlobin in SCD, with a potential first submission for regulatory approval in 2022. 
 We are developing our Lenti-D product candidate for CALD, a rare, hereditary neurological disorder that is often fatal.  If our Lenti-D product candidate shows a sufficiently compelling treatment effect, and pending further discussion with regulatory authorities, the results from the phase 2/3 clinical study of our Lenti-D product candidate, called the Starbeam study, could potentially form the basis of a BLA submission in the United States and  a MAA submission in the European Union. We anticipate a potential first submission for regulatory approval of our Lenti-D product candidate for the treatment of patients with CALD in 2019. 
 In collaboration with Celgene Corporation, or Celgene, we are developing our bb2121 and bb21217 product candidates in multiple myeloma, a hematologic malignancy that develops in the bone marrow and is fatal if untreated. We are co-developing and co-promoting the bb2121 product candidate in the United States with Celgene and we have exclusively licensed to Celgene the development and commercialization rights for the bb2121 product candidate outside of the United States. We and Celgene anticipate the first potential approval of the bb2121 product candidate for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in the second half of 2020. We have exclusively licensed the development and commercialization rights for the bb21217 product candidate to Celgene, with an option for us to elect to co-develop and co-promote bb21217 within the United States.
 Our Gene Therapy Platform
 Our platform is based on lentiviral vectors which are used to introduce a functional copy of a gene to the patient’s own isolated hematopoietic stem cells, or HSCs, in the case of our LentiGlobin and Lenti-D product candidates, or the patient’s own isolated white blood cells which include T cells, in the case of our bb2121 and bb21217 product candidates. Additionally, we have developed a proprietary cell-based vector manufacturing process that is both reproducible and scalable. We believe our innovations in viral vector design and related manufacturing processes are important steps towards advancing the field of gene therapy and in realizing its full potential on a commercial scale. 
 Utilizing our platform, we are developing product candidates comprising the patient’s own gene-modified HSCs and T cells. Clinical proof-of-concept already exists for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or HSCT, an approach of treating a patient with HSCs contributed by a donor other than the patient that contain the properly functioning copy of the gene whose mutation has caused the underlying disease.  However, this approach has significant limitations, including difficulties in finding appropriate genetically-matched donors and carries the risk of transplant-related rejection, graft-versus-host disease, or GVHD, and mortality. Our approach is intended to address the significant limitations of allogeneic HSCT while utilizing existing stem cell transplant infrastructure and processes. Also, because our approach has the potential to drive sustained expression of the functional protein encoded by the gene insert after a single-administration, we believe the value proposition offered by our product candidates for patients, families, health care providers and payors would be significant.

Although our initial focus for severe genetic diseases is in TDT, SCD and CALD, and for cancer is in multiple myeloma, we believe our gene therapy platform has broad therapeutic potential in a variety of indications. We believe that our lentiviral vectors can be used to introduce virtually any gene into a cell and have the potential to be manufactured on a commercial scale reproducibly and reliably, as each new vector is produced using substantially the same process. 
 We also have discovery research programs utilizing our cell signaling and gene editing technology platform across our pipeline. For instance, we are exploring applications of our CAR and TCR T cell technologies in combination with novel proteins based on synthetic biology. These technologies may potentially allow our future T cell-based product candidates to detect the tumor microenvironment or, in the case of future CAR T cell product candidates, to be regulated by small molecules. In addition, we are focused on utilizing homing endonuclease and megaTAL gene editing technologies in a variety of potential applications and disease areas, including oncology, hematology and other diseases.  Homing endonucleases and megaTALs are novel enzymes that provide a highly specific and efficient way to modify DNA sequences to edit or insert genetic components to potentially treat a variety of diseases.

 The LentiGlobin product candidate 
 β-thalassemia 
 Overview 
 β-thalassemia is a rare genetic disease caused by a mutation in the β-globin gene resulting in the production of defective red blood cells, or RBCs. Genetic mutations cause the absence or reduced production of the beta chains of hemoglobin, or β-globin, thereby preventing the proper formation of hemoglobin A, which normally accounts for greater than 95% of the hemoglobin in the blood of adults. Hemoglobin is an iron-containing protein in the blood that carries oxygen from the respiratory organs to the rest of the body. Hemoglobin A consists of four chains—two chains each of α-globin and β-globin. Genetic mutations that impair the production of β-globin can lead to a relative excess of α-globin, leading to premature death of RBCs. The clinical implications of the α-globin/ β-globin imbalance are two-fold: first, patients lack sufficient RBCs and hemoglobin to effectively transport oxygen throughout the body and can become severely anemic; and second, the ineffective production of RBCs can lead to a range of multi-systemic complications, including but not limited to splenomegaly, marrow expansion, bone deformities, and iron overload in major organs. 
 The clinical course of β-thalassemia correlates with the degree of globin chain imbalance. Nearly 350 different mutations have been described in patients with β-thalassemia. Mutations can be categorized as those that result in no functional β-globin production (β0) and those that result in decreased functional β-globin production (β+). TDT refers to any mutation pairing that results in the need for chronic transfusions due to severe anemia. Affected patients produce as little as one to seven g/dL of hemoglobin (in contrast, a normal adult produces 12 to 18 g/dL of hemoglobin). 
 Limitations of current treatment options 
 In geographies where treatment is available, patients with TDT receive chronic blood transfusions to survive. These regimens consist of regular infusions with units of packed RBC, or pRBC, usually every two to five weeks, which are intended to maintain hemoglobin levels and control symptoms of the disease. While chronic blood transfusions can be effective at minimizing the symptoms of TDT, they often lead to unavoidable iron overload, which over time may lead to significant morbidity and mortality through iron-associated heart and liver toxicity. To help reduce iron overload-associated risks and resulting complications, patients must adhere to therapeutic iron chelation regimens to reduce the iron overload.  Despite improvements in supportive care with transfusion and chelation, the overall life expectancy for a patient with TDT is significantly reduced compared to the general population. In addition, patient and caregiver quality of life can be significantly affected by complications associated with TDT and chronic disease management.
 The only potentially curative therapy for β-thalassemia has been allogeneic HSCT, with best outcomes observed in pediatric patients with a matched sibling donor.  However, allogeneic HSCT is associated with serious risks, some of which can be life threatening and result in death.  Potential complications of allogeneic HSCT include a risk of engraftment failure in unrelated human-leukocyte-antigen, or HLA, matched patients, a risk of life-threatening infection, and a risk of GVHD, a common complication in which donor immune cells (white blood cells in the graft) recognize the cells of the recipient (the host) as “foreign” and attack them.  As a result of these safety challenges, allogeneic HSCT can lead to significant mortality rates, particularly for patients treated with cells from a donor who is not a matched sibling, and in patients >11 years old. Consequently, we believe there is a need for an option that can address the underlying genetic cause of TDT for more patients, and that TDT is a life-shortening disease with a significant unmet medical need.

Sickle cell disease 
 Overview 
 Sickle cell disease, or SCD, is a hereditary blood disorder resulting from a mutation in the β-globin gene that causes polymerization of hemoglobin proteins, resulting in abnormal red blood cell function. The disease is characterized by anemia, vaso-occlusive events (a common complication of SCD in which there is severe pain due to obstructed blood flow in the small blood vessels of the body), cumulative damage to multiple organs, infections, stroke, overall poor quality of life and early death in a large subset of patients. Under low-oxygen conditions, which are exacerbated by the RBC abnormalities, the mutant hemoglobin polymerizes causing the RBCs to take on a sickle shape, which causes them to aggregate and obstruct small blood vessels, thereby restricting blood flow to organs resulting in pain, cell death and organ damage. If oxygen levels are restored, the hemoglobin can depolymerize and the RBCs will return to their normal shape, but over time, repeated sickling damages the cell membrane and the cells fail to return to the normal shape even in high-oxygen conditions. 
 Limitations of current treatment options 
 Where adequate medical care is available, common treatments for patients with SCD largely revolve around management and prevention of acute sickling episodes. Chronic management may include hydroxyurea and, in certain cases, chronic RBC transfusions. Hydroxyurea is currently one of two medications approved for the treatment of SCD and is recommended for patients with recurrent moderate to severe painful crises, to reduce the frequency of painful crises. However, not all SCD patients respond to hydroxyurea, or are able to tolerate the cytotoxic effect of reduced white blood cell and platelet counts. A significant number of patients with SCD find it difficult to adhere to hydroxyurea treatment, and for most patients there is no effective long-term treatment. L-glutamine was approved by the FDA in 2017 as the second medication for the treatment of sickle cell disease and as such, there is limited long-term data available regarding its safety or efficacy.
 RBC transfusion therapy can be utilized to maintain the level of sickle hemoglobin below 30% to 50%, which decreases sickling of RBCs, reduces the risk of recurrent stroke, and decreases the incidence of associated co-morbidities. While transfusion therapy can be critical in the management of acute disease, and can be vital in preventing some of the chronic manifestations of SCD, it does not provide equal benefit to all patients.  Furthermore, in patients with SCD, it is associated with risks such as infection with blood-borne pathogens, alloimmunization, and adverse transfusion reactions that may lead to fatal outcomes.  Additional complications of chronic transfusion include iron overload.
 The only potentially curative therapy currently available for SCD is allogeneic HSCT, but it is limited to patients with severe disease manifestations and carries significant risk of transplant-related morbidity and mortality. Thus, this option is usually offered primarily to pediatric patients with available sibling-matched donors. It is particularly difficult to find suitable donors for individuals of African descent, and it is estimated that only a fraction of eligible patients undergo transplant. In light of these factors, we believe that SCD is a seriously debilitating and life-threatening disease with a significant unmet medical need. 
 Development of the LentiGlobin product candidate
 We are developing our LentiGlobin product candidate as a potential one-time treatment for both TDT and SCD. Our approach involves the ex vivo insertion of the normal β-globin gene with an amino acid substitution using a lentiviral vector into the patient’s own HSCs to enable formation of normally functioning hemoglobin A and normal RBCs in patients. Importantly, this amino acid substitution, referred to as T87Q, also serves as a distinct biomarker used to quantify expression levels of the functional β-globin protein in patients with TDT and SCD, while also providing anti-sickling properties in the context of SCD. We refer to the cells that have undergone our ex vivo manufacturing process resulting in genetically modified HSCs as the LentiGlobin drug product, or our LentiGlobin product candidate. 
 We are conducting, or have conducted, the following clinical studies of our LentiGlobin product candidate to evaluate its safety and efficacy in the treatment of patients with TDT:
  
• | Northstar study (HGB-204), a multi-site, international phase 1/2 study of patients with TDT. In March 2014, we announced that the first patient had been treated in this study. This study was completed in February 2018, and patients in this study were enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol to assess safety and efficacy beyond the Northstar study follow-up period.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Northstar-2 study (HGB-207), a multi-site, international phase 3 study of patients with TDT and non-β0/β0 genotypes. In December 2016, we announced that the first patient had been treated in this study.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Northstar-3 study (HGB-212), a multi-site, international phase 3 study of patients with TDT and β0/β0 genotypes or an IVS-I-110 mutation. In November 2017, we announced that the first patient had been treated in this study.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | HGB-205, a single-center phase 1/2 study in France of patients with TDT, which also enrolled patients with SCD. In December 2013, we announced that the first patient with TDT had been treated in this study.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are conducting, or plan to conduct, the following clinical studies of our LentiGlobin product candidate to evaluate its safety and efficacy in the treatment of patients with SCD:
  
• | HGB-206, a multi-site phase 1/2 study in the United States of patients with SCD. In October 2016, we announced amendments in the study protocol to incorporate several process changes, including using a refined drug product manufacturing process. In February 2017, we announced that the first patient had been treated under this amended study protocol.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HGB-205, a single-center phase 1/2 study in France of patients with SCD which also enrolled patients with TDT. In October 2014, we announced that the first patient with SCD had been treated in this study.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HGB-210, our planned multi-site, international phase 3 study of patients with SCD and a history of vaso-occlusive events, or VOEs. We anticipate that this study will have a comparable design to our HGB-206 study. We plan to initiate this study in 2019.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our LentiGlobin product candidate has been granted Orphan Drug status by the FDA and EMA for both β-thalassemia and SCD. Our LentiGlobin product candidate was granted Fast-Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of β-thalassemia major and for the treatment of certain patients with SCD.  The FDA has also granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to our LentiGlobin product candidate for the treatment of SCD.  The FDA has granted to our LentiGlobin product candidate Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of transfusion-dependent patients with β-thalassemia major, and rare pediatric disease designation for the treatment of TDT. We are participating in the EMA’s Adaptive Pathways pilot program (formerly referred to as Adaptive Licensing), which is part of the EMA’s effort to improve timely access for patients to new medicines. In addition, the EMA has granted Priority Medicines (PRIME) eligibility for our LentiGlobin product candidate in the treatment of TDT. 
 In October 2018, we announced that the EMA accepted our marketing authorization application, or MAA, for LentiGlobin for the treatment of adolescents and adults with TDT and non-β0/β0 genotypes.  We anticipate a potential first conditional approval in the EU in 2019. Conversion to full approval may be subject to the successful completion of our Northstar-2 study and Northstar-3 study, or other studies we may be required to conduct, supportive long-term follow-up data and “real-world” post-approval monitoring data. Whether or not our clinical data are sufficient to support conditional, and ultimately full, approval will be a review decision by the EMA and European Commission. We also plan to submit a BLA in the United States in 2019 on the basis of the Northstar study and the Northstar-2 study of our LentiGlobin product candidate for the treatment of patients with TDT and non-β0/β0 genotypes. In addition, if successful, we believe the data from our Northstar-3 study, together with data from our Northstar study and Northstar-2 study and HGB-205 study could be sufficient to form the basis for a BLA supplement submission in the United States, and a MAA variation submission in the EU, for our LentiGlobin product candidate for the treatment of patients with TDT and β0/β0 genotypes. 
 We are engaged with the FDA and the EMA in ongoing discussions regarding our proposed development plans for our LentiGlobin product candidate in SCD. Based on these discussions and clinical data for our LentiGlobin product candidate in SCD, we are exploring efficacy endpoints in our HGB-206 study and planned HGB-210 study that may allow us to pursue a more accelerated development path in the United States of our LentiGlobin product candidate for the treatment of patients with SCD who have a history of VOEs.  Specifically, we are exploring the use of a primary efficacy endpoint based on βA-T87Q expression and total hemoglobin, and of a key secondary endpoint of frequency of VOEs.  As expanded and modified in October 2018, the HGB-206 study will increase the overall set of clinical data regarding the relationship between anti-sickling hemoglobin and clinical outcomes, and has the potential to validate the new primary efficacy endpoint as a surrogate endpoint for other SCD clinical outcomes such as VOEs. Although we cannot be certain that the HGB-206 study and planned HGB-210 study will be sufficient to form the basis for a BLA submission in the United States or a MAA in Europe for the treatment of patients with SCD, these studies have been expanded, modified and planned with the goal of achieving a more accelerated development path for our LentiGlobin product candidate in the United States for the treatment of patients with SCD who have a history of VOEs, with a potential first submission for regulatory approval in 2022.  
 Clinical results of the LentiGlobin product candidate 
  
• | Northstar study (HGB-204) – phase 1/2 study for the treatment of patients with TDT
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our Northstar study is a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, multi-site phase 1/2 clinical study in the United States, Australia and Thailand to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the LentiGlobin product candidate in increasing hemoglobin production and eliminating or reducing transfusion dependence following treatment. In March 2014, we announced that the first patient had been treated in our Northstar study. In February 2018, we announced that the last patient in this study had completed the follow-up period under the Northstar study protocol.

Eighteen adults and adolescents were enrolled in the study. To be eligible for enrollment in this study, patients were between 12 and 35 years of age with a diagnosis of TDT and received at least 100 mL/kg/year of pRBCs or at least eight transfusions per year in each of the two years preceding enrollment. The patients were also eligible for allogeneic HSCT. 
 Efficacy was evaluated primarily by the production of ≥2.0 g/dL of hemoglobin A containing βA-T87Q-globin for the six-month period between 18 and 24 months post-treatment. Exploratory efficacy endpoints included pRBC transfusion requirements (measured in milliliters per kilogram) per month and per year, post-treatment. Safety evaluations performed during the study include success and kinetics of HSC engraftment, incidence of transplant-related mortality post-treatment, overall survival, detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any patient and characterization of events of insertional mutagenesis leading to clonal dominance or leukemia. Subjects were monitored by regular screening. Each patient remained on study for approximately 26 months from time of consent and then were enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy beyond the study protocol’s follow-up period. 
 In December 2018, we presented updated clinical data from our Northstar study at the 60th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology, or ASH Annual Meeting. All data presented at the ASH Annual Meeting and summarized below are as of the data cut-off date of September 14, 2018:
  
o | Ten patients with non-β0/β0 genotypes and eight patients with β0/β0 genotypes have undergone infusion with LentiGlobin drug product in the study.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Of the ten patients with TDT and non-β0/β0 genotypes, eight patients achieved transfusion independence, meaning they had not received a transfusion for at least 12 months and maintained hemoglobin levels of ≥9 g/dL. These eight patients have maintained transfusion independence for a median duration of 38 months, with a range of 21 to 44 months. At the last study visit, total hemoglobin levels for these eight transfusion-independent patients were stable and ranged from 9.7 to 14.1 g/dL. HbAT87Q levels remained stable in these patients over time, for up to four years.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Of the eight patients with TDT and a β0/β0 genotype, three patients achieved transfusion independence. These three patients had more than two years of follow up, and two of the three patients had follow-up for more than 3.5 years. All three patients maintained transfusion independence through their last study visit, with total hemoglobin levels ranging from 9.1 to 10.9 g/dL.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | An exploratory assessment was conducted to assess liver iron concentration in the 11 patients who have become transfusion independent in the Northstar study. Liver iron concentrations were measured at baseline and then at every 12 months after treatment. Over time, iron concentrations began to decrease in these 11 patients, with the largest decrease observed in the three patients who had at least 48 months of data available.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The safety profile of the LentiGlobin drug product continues to be consistent with myeloblative conditioning with single-agent busulfan. No grade 3 or higher drug product-related adverse events have been observed. The median time to platelet engraftment was 39.5 days, with a range of 19 to 191 days.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Northstar-2 study (HGB-207) – phase 3 study for the treatment of patients with TDT and non-β0/ β0 genotypes
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our Northstar-2 study is an ongoing single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, international, multi-site phase 3 clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the LentiGlobin product candidate to treat patients with TDT and non-β0/β0 genotypes. In December 2016, we announced that the first patient had been treated in our Northstar-2 study.
 Approximately 23 patients will be enrolled in the study, consisting of at least 15 adolescent and adult patients between 12 and 50 years of age at enrollment, and at least eight pediatric patients less than 12 years of age at enrollment. To be enrolled, patients with TDT and non-β0/β0 genotypes must have received at least 100 mL/kg/year of pRBCs or at least eight transfusions per year for the past two years. All patients must be eligible for allogeneic HSCT, but without a matched family allogeneic HSCT donor. Subjects in our Northstar-2 study will be treated with our LentiGlobin product candidate manufactured using our refined drug product manufacturing process with the objective of increasing the vector copy number and the percentage of transduced cells, relative to the drug product manufacturing process used in our Northstar study.
 The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of treated patients who achieve transfusion independence, defined as weighted average hemoglobin levels ≥9.0 g/dL without any pRBC transfusions for a continuous period of at least 12 months at any time during the study after treatment. The secondary endpoints of this study are to quantify gene transfer efficiency and expression, and to measure the effects of treatment with the LentiGlobin drug product on transfusion requirements post-treatment and clinical events. Safety evaluations to be performed during the study include success and kinetics of HSC engraftment, incidence of transplant-related mortality post-treatment, overall survival, detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any patient and characterization of events of insertional mutagenesis leading to clonal dominance or leukemia. Each patient will remain on study for approximately 24 months post-treatment and then will be enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy beyond the study protocol’s follow-up period.

In December 2018, we presented updated clinical data from our Northstar-2 study at the ASH Annual Meeting. All data presented at the ASH Annual Meeting and summarized below are as of the data cut-off date of September 14, 2018:
  
o | Sixteen patients with non-β0/β0 genotypes, ranging from 8 to 34 years of age, have undergone infusion with LentiGlobin drug product in the study, including two pediatric patients and 14 adolescents/ adults.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Eleven of these patients had at least three months of follow-up available. Ten of the 11 patients had stopped receiving transfusions and had hemoglobin levels ranging from 11.1 to 13.3 g/dL at the time of the last study visit (which occurred at 3 to 18 months post-treatment). HbAT87Q levels in these 10 patients ranged from 7.7 to 10.6 g/dL, which significantly contributed to total hemoglobin (ranging from 67 to 92 percent of total hemoglobin).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | An exploratory analysis was conducted with bone marrow from six patients with 12 months of follow-up after treatment. The samples were evaluated for cellularity and myeloid to erythroid ratio. In five patients, all of whom had stopped chronic transfusions, an increase in the myeloid to erythroid ratio was observed, suggesting improvement in red blood cell production. A low myeloid to erythroid ratio is a key feature of dyserythropoesis, or abnormal bone marrow red blood cell production, characteristic of patients with TDT.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The safety profile of LentiGlobin drug product continues to be consistent with myeloablative conditioning with single-agent busulfan, including serious adverse events (SAE) of veno-occlusive liver disease. One SAE of grade 3 thrombocytopenia was reported and considered possibly drug product-related.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Northstar-3 study (HGB-212) – phase 3 study for the treatment of patients with TDT and β0/β0 genotypes or IVS-I-110 mutation
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our Northstar-3 study is an ongoing single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, international, multi-site phase 3 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the LentiGlobin product candidate to treat patients with TDT and β0/β0 genotypes or IVS-I-110 mutation. In November 2017, we announced that the first patient had been treated in our Northstar-3 study.
 Approximately 15 patients who are less than 50 years of age at enrollment will be enrolled in the study. To be eligible, patients with TDT and β0/β0 genotypes or IVS-I-110 mutation must have received at least 100 mL/kg/year of pRBCs or at least eight transfusions per year for the past two years. All patients must be clinically stable and eligible to undergo HSCT, as well as having been treated and followed for at least the last two years in a specialized center that maintained detailed medical records, including transfusion history. Patients in our Northstar-3 study will be treated with our LentiGlobin product candidate manufactured using our refined drug product manufacturing process with the objective of increasing the vector copy number and the percentage of transduced cells, relative to the drug product manufacturing process used in our Northstar study. 
 The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of treated patients who meet the definition of “transfusion reduction”, which is defined as demonstration of reduction in volume of pRBC transfusion requirements (in mL/kg) in the post-treatment time period of months 12 to 24 compared to the average annual transfusion requirement in the 24 months prior to enrollment.  The secondary endpoints of this study are to measure the proportion of patients who meet the definition of “transfusion independence” and also quantify gene transfer efficiency and expression, and measure the effects of treatment with the LentiGlobin drug product on transfusion requirements post-treatment and clinical events. Each patient will remain on study for approximately 24 months post-treatment and then will be enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy beyond the study protocol’s follow-up period.
 In December 2018, we presented updated clinical data from our Northstar-3 study at the ASH Annual Meeting. All data presented at the ASH Annual Meeting and summarized below are as of the data cut-off date of September 14, 2018, except as otherwise noted: 
  
o | Three patients with TDT and β0/β0 genotypes or IVS-I-110 mutation had been treated with LentiGlobin.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | All three patients, including a pediatric patient, had total hemoglobin of greater than 10 g/dL at their last assessment as of November 19, 2018. Patient 1 had no transfusions following LentiGlobin treatment and their last assessment at month 12, Patient 2 had their last transfusion 1.9 months post-treatment and last assessment at month six, Patient 3 had their last transfusion at 1.4 months post-treatment and last assessment at month three.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The safety profile of LentiGlobin drug product continues to be consistent with myeloablative conditioning with single-agent busulfan. No grade 3 or higher drug product-related adverse events have been observed.

• | The HGB-206 study – phase 1/2 study for the treatment of patients with SCD
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our HGB-206 study is a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, multi-site phase 1/2 clinical study in the United States to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the LentiGlobin product candidate to treat SCD.  
 Up to 50 adult and adolescent patients will be enrolled in the study. Patients must be ≥18 years of age with a diagnosis of sickle cell disease, with either βS/βS or βS/β0 genotype. The sickle cell disease must be severe, as defined by recurrent severe VOEs, acute chest syndrome (ACS), history of an overt stroke, or echocardiographic evidence of an elevated tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity, an indicator of pulmonary hypertension, and patients must have failed to achieve clinical benefit from treatment with hydroxyurea.  The patients must also be eligible for HSCT. We refer to the patients enrolled under the original study protocol as patients in “Group A.” In October 2016, we announced amendments in the study protocol to incorporate several changes with the goal of increasing production of anti-sickling β-globin, such as increasing the percentage of transduced cells through manufacturing improvements, increasing target busulfan area under the curve, introducing a minimum period of regular blood transfusions prior to stem cell collection, and collecting HSCs from peripheral blood after mobilization with plerixafor rather than via bone marrow harvest. We refer to the patients enrolled under the amended study protocol utilizing HSCs from bone marrow harvest as patients in “Group B.” We refer to the patients enrolled under the amended study protocol utilizing HSCs from peripheral blood after mobilization with plerixafor as patients in “Group C.” In February 2017, we announced that the first patient had been treated under the amended study protocol.
 The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is based on βA-T87Q expression and total hemoglobin, and the secondary efficacy endpoint for this study is the frequency of VOEs. Safety endpoints include monitoring for laboratory parameters and frequency and severity of adverse events; the success and kinetics of HSC engraftment; the incidence of treatment related mortality and overall survival; the detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any patient; and the characterization of events of insertional mutagenesis leading to clonal dominance or leukemia. Each patient will remain on study for approximately 26 months from time of consent and then will be enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy beyond the study protocol’s follow up period.
 In December 2018, we presented updated clinical data from our HGB-206 study at the ASH Annual Meeting. All data presented at the ASH Annual Meeting and summarized below are as of the data cut-off date as of September 14, 2018:
  
o | Group A: A total of seven patients have undergone infusion with LentiGlobin drug product in Group A, with up to 39 months of follow-up. Consistent HbAT87Q production was observed ranging from 0.7 to 2.8 g/dL at last visit and patients maintained stable total hemoglobin levels ranging from 7.6 to 11.8 g/dL at last visit.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Group B: Two patients have undergone infusion with LentiGlobin drug product in Group B, with up to 17 months of follow-up. HbAT87Q production was higher in Group B patients, ranging from 3.4 to 6.5 g/dL and total hemoglobin levels were stable at 11.0 to 12.3 g/dL at last visit. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Group C: A total of nine patients have undergone infusion with LentiGlobin drug product in Group C.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | In the four patients who were six months post treatment, HbAT87Q product ranged from 4.8 to 8.8 g/dL and were comparable to or exceeded the levels of HbS. These patients did not receive a blood transfusion during this time and had total hemoglobin levels ranging from 9.9 to 13.7 g/dL at their last visit.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | No VOEs were reported (up to nine months post treatment with LentiGlobin). In an exploratory analysis, key markers of hemolysis, including reticulocyte counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and total bilirubin concentration had decreased compared to baseline.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | To help assess the distribution of HbAT87Q in the red blood cells, we have developed an antibody that recognizes βS, the protein present in HbS. Using this antibody, the amount of βS was measured in the red blood cells obtained from healthy donors (βA/βA), sickle cell trait donors (βS/βA) and patients with sickle cell disease (βS/βS). Clear and distinct distribution of βS was observed in these control samples, with highest expression in the βS/βS samples, followed by βS/βA and no expression of βS in the healthy donor (βA/βA) samples. Initial results from two patients treated with LentiGlobin gene therapy, who were nine months post treatment, showed that nearly all their red blood cells had lower amounts of βS than the βS/βS and the βS/βA control samples. Given that these patients were no longer receiving any blood transfusions, this suggests βS expression was reduced in these patients due to the production of HbAT87Q following treatment with LentiGlobin.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The safety profile of the LentiGlobin drug product continues to be consistent with myeloablative conditioning with single-agent busulfan. One SAE of myelodysplasia syndrome was reported in a patient who received LentiGlobin approximately three years ago in Group A. Analysis of the patient’s cells showed no evidence of vector-mediated insertional oncogenesis, and the independent data monitoring committees, along with the treating physician, agreed the SAE was unlikely related to the drug product.

• | The HGB-205 study – phase 1/2 for the treatment of patients with TDT or SCD
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our HGB-205 study is a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, phase 1/2 clinical study at a single site in France to examine the safety and efficacy of our LentiGlobin product candidate in up to seven patients with a diagnosis of TDT or SCD. In December 2013, we announced that the first patient with TDT had been treated in our HGB-205 study and in October 2014 we announced that the first patient with SCD had been treated in our HGB-205 study.
 Patients must be between five and 35 years of age with a diagnosis of TDT or SCD. To be enrolled, patients with TDT must have received at least 100 mL/kg/year of pRBCs per year for the past two years. Those with SCD must have failed to achieve clinical benefit from treatment with hydroxyurea and have an additional poor prognostic risk factor (e.g., recurrent VOEs or ACS). All patients must be eligible for allogeneic HSCT, but without a matched sibling allogeneic HSCT donor. This study is fully enrolled, with four patients with TDT and three patients with SCD enrolled in this study.
 The primary objective of our HGB-205 study is to determine the safety, tolerability and success of engraftment of the LentiGlobin drug product. The secondary objectives of the study are to quantify gene transfer efficiency and expression, and to measure the effects of treatment with the LentiGlobin drug product on disease-specific biological parameters and clinical events. In the case of patients with TDT and SCD, this means the volume of pRBC transfusions, and for patients with SCD, it also means the number of VOEs and ACS in each patient, compared with the two-year period prior to treatment. Safety evaluations to be performed during the study include success and kinetics of HSC engraftment, incidence of transplant-related mortality post-treatment, overall survival, detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any patient and characterization of events of insertional mutagenesis leading to clonal dominance or leukemia. 
 In December 2017, we presented updated clinical data from our HGB-205 study in patients with SCD or TDT at the 59th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology.  All data presented and summarized below are as of the data cut-off date of September 20, 2017:
  
o | All three patients with SCD showed rising HbAT87Q in the first six months following infusion.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Patient 1204 was 13 years old at study enrollment. At 30 months post-drug product infusion, this patient had a total hemoglobin level of 12.4 g/dL, of which 6.1 g/dL was HbAT87Q and 52 percent was anti-sickling hemoglobin. HbAT87Q concentration in this patient has remained stable since approximately nine months post-infusion. The patient continues to show marked clinical improvement.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Patient 1207 was 16 years old at study enrollment. At 9 months following drug product infusion, this patient had a total hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, of which 0.7 g/dL was HbAT87Q and 14 percent was anti-sickling hemoglobin). This patient had a pre-treatment history of frequent episodes of VOEs and ACS despite hydroxyurea prior to beginning regular transfusions. Patient 1207 had episodes of ACS and hospitalization at six and eight months post-treatment, and was treated with exchange transfusions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Patient 1208 was 21 years old at study enrollment. At last follow-up (6.0 months), this patient had a total hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, of which 2.7 g/dL was HbAT87Q and 46 percent was anti-sickling hemoglobin). This patient had a pre-treatment history of frequent episodes of VOEs and ACS prior to beginning regular transfusions, and was still symptomatic while receiving regular transfusions. Following LentiGlobin treatment, Patient 1208 has had no episodes of VOEs or ACS (with six months follow-up).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | All four patients with TDT have remained free of chronic transfusions since shortly after receiving LentiGlobin drug product. Patient 1201 (β0/βE genotype) has been free of transfusions for 45.2 months with total hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL at month 42, of which 6.7 g/dL was HbAT87Q. Patient 1202 (β0/βE genotype) has been free of transfusions for 40.1 months with total hemoglobin of 12.9 g/dLat month 42, of which 10.1 g/dL was HbAT87Q. Patient 1206 (β0/βE genotype) has been free of transfusions for 23.8 months with total hemoglobin of 11.1 g/dL at month 21, of which 8.0 g/dL was HbAT87Q. Subject 1203, who is homozygous for the severe β+ mutation IVS1-110, has been free of transfusions for 20.9 months with total hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL at month 24, of which 6.7 g/dL was HbAT87Q. Three of four patients (1201, 1202 and 1206) were able to begin therapeutic phlebotomy. Patient 1202 subsequently discontinued iron chelation and phlebotomy.

The Lenti-D product candidate 
 Adrenoleukodystrophy 
 Overview
 Adrenoleukodystrophy is a rare X-linked, metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene which results in a deficiency in adrenoleukodystrophy protein, or ALDP, and subsequent accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids, or VLCFA. VLCFA accumulation occurs in plasma and all tissue types, but primarily affects the adrenal cortex and white matter of the brain and spinal cord, leading to a range of clinical outcomes. The most severe form of ALD, the inflammatory cerebral phenotype, referred to as CALD, involves a progressive destruction of myelin, the protective sheath of the nerve cells in the brain that are responsible for thinking and muscle control. Symptoms of CALD usually occur in early childhood and progress rapidly if untreated, leading to severe loss of neurological function and eventual death in most patients. We estimate that approximately 35% to 40% of boys with ALD will develop CALD. 
 Limitations of current treatment options 
 Currently, the only effective treatment option for CALD is allogeneic HSCT. In this procedure, the patient is treated with HSCs containing a functioning copy of the gene contributed by a donor other than the patient. Allogeneic HSCT is an effective treatment option for patients in the earliest stages of cerebral disease, particularly if done using cells from an unaffected human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor, which minimizes the risk associated with allogeneic HSCT. However, the majority of allogeneic HSCT procedures for CALD are carried out with non-sibling matched donor cells or partially matched related or unrelated donor cells including umbilical cord blood cells because a matched sibling donor is not available. While safety risks, including transplant-related morbidity and mortality, graft failure, GVHD, and opportunistic infections are of particular concern when transplants are performed in the absence of a matched sibling donor, the potential for life-threatening risks exists even when an HLA-matched sibling donor is available. Donor availability and transplant-related risks limit the broader use of allogeneic HSCT. 
 As the outcome of HSCT varies with clinical stage of the disease at the time of transplant, early diagnosis of CALD is important. In the United States, newborn screening for ALD was added in February 2016 to the Recommended Universal Screening Panel, a list of disorders that are screened at birth and recommended by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for states to screen as part of their state universal newborn screening program. Disorders are chosen based on evidence that supports the potential net benefit of screening, among other factors. An increasing number of states are including ALD testing in their state newborn screening programs.
 Development of the Lenti-D product candidate 
 We are developing our Lenti-D product candidate as an autologous treatment of CALD, with the potential to provide the effectiveness seen with allogeneic HSCT, but without the immunologic risk. Our approach involves the ex vivo insertion of a functional copy of the ABCD1 gene via a lentiviral vector into the patient’s own HSCs. Following engraftment, we expect the transduced HSCs to differentiate into other cell types, including macrophages and cerebral microglia, which produce functional ALDP. We believe that the functional ALDP can then enable the local degradation of VLCFAs in the brain, which in turn can stabilize the disease by preventing further cerebral inflammation and demyelination that are characteristics of CALD.
 We are conducting the Starbeam study (ALD-102), a multi-site, international phase 2/3 study of our Lenti-D product candidate to evaluate its safety and efficacy in the treatment of patients with CALD. In early 2019, we intend to initiate our planned ALD-104 study, multi-site phase 3 study of our Lenti-D product candidate for the treatment of patients with CALD, to enable access following completion of enrollment in the Starbeam study, and to evaluate the suitability of an additional conditioning regimen for use with the Lenti-D product candidate. 
 Based on our discussions with the FDA and EMA, we believe that we may be able to seek approval for our Lenti-D product candidate for the treatment of patients with CALD on the basis of the clinical data from our ongoing Starbeam study, and the ongoing ALD-103 observational study. For the assessment of efficacy, we expect that the clinical results of the Starbeam study will be compared to a clinically meaningful benchmark based on the medical literature and data collected in ALD-101, a retrospective analysis that assessed the natural history of CALD as well as outcomes of patients with CALD who had received allogeneic HSCT. For the assessment of safety, we expect that the clinical results of the Starbeam study will be compared to data collected from the ALD-103 study, a multinational, multi-site, prospective and retrospective observational study that is running concurrently with the Starbeam study and is designed to evaluate outcomes of allogeneic HSCT in patients with CALD. We anticipate a potential first submission for regulatory approval of our Lenti-D product candidate for the treatment of patients with CALD in 2019. Lenti-D has been granted Orphan Drug status by the FDA and EMA for adrenoleukodystrophy. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation and the EMA has granted PRIME eligibility to the Lenti-D product candidate for CALD.

Clinical results of the Lenti-D product candidate
  
• | Completed non-interventional retrospective study (the ALD-101 Study)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 CALD is a rare disease and as such, data on the natural history of the disease, as well as the efficacy and safety profile of allogeneic HSCT is limited in the scientific literature. In order to further characterize the natural history of CALD, describe outcomes after HSCT, and identify predictors of positive treatment outcomes, we performed a large, multicenter, retrospective chart review and collected data on 72 untreated CALD patients, and 65 CALD patients who received allogeneic HSCT.  In the study, we collected survival, functional and neuropsychological assessments and neuroimaging data for both treated and untreated patients, as available; however, given the retrospective nature of the study, we were not able to collect comprehensive data for all patients.  Additional analyses were conducted to gain further insight into ongoing risks and determinants of successful outcomes after HSCT, identify appropriate populations for treatment, and define endpoints that could be useful for future clinical studies.
  
• | Starbeam study (ALD-102) – phase 2/3 study for the treatment of patients with CALD
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our Starbeam study is a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, international, multi-site phase 2/3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Lenti-D drug product in males with CALD ≤ 17 years of age. We treated the first patient in the Starbeam study in the United States in October 2013. We announced that we achieved our enrollment target in September 2018.
 In the study, patients must be age seventeen years or younger with a confirmed diagnosis of active CALD, including elevated levels of plasma VLCFA, a Loes score of 0.5 to ≤ 9, inclusive, evidence of gadolinium enhancement and an NFS ≤ 1. Patients with a willing, unaffected 10/10 HLA-matched sibling HSCT donor are excluded from the study.
 The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients who are alive and free of major functional disabilities (MFD) at 24 months post-treatment.  MFDs, which represent end-stage disease, have been characterized as having the most significant impact on the ability of patients with CALD to function independently, representing unambiguous and profound neurologic degeneration. These MFDs are: loss of communication, no voluntary movement, cortical blindness, tube feeding, wheelchair dependence, and total incontinence. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include the following:
  
o | Changes in neurologic function score (NFS), a 25-point scale used to evaluate the severity of gross neurologic dysfunction by scoring 15 neurological abnormalities across multiple domains.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Changes in Loes score, a 34-point scale designed to objectively measure the extent of demyelination and atrophy in CALD patients, based on brain magnetic resonance imagining, or MRI, studies. Increasing Loes scores indicate worsening disease.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Gadolinium enhancement (GdE). CALD can progress rapidly and is associated with severe inflammation and disruption of the blood brain barrier which can be detected by gadolinium enhancement on brain MRI. Evidence of gadolinium enhancement, referred to by clinicians as a gadolinium positive result, is highly predictive of rapid neurologic decline. However, while pre-transplant gadolinium status is clearly correlated with rapid disease progression, the kinetics of gadolinium enhancement after clinically successful HCST are not well understood. GdE was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every six months following transplant up to 24-months, and every 12 months thereafter.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The primary safety endpoint is the proportion of patients who experience either ≥ Grade 2 acute GVHD or chronic GVHD by 2 years post-treatment. Additional safety evaluations include the following: success and kinetics of HSC engraftment, incidence of transplant-related mortality; detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus; and characterization and quantification of events related to the location of insertion of the functional gene in target cells. Patients will be followed for 24 months post-treatment under this protocol. In accordance with applicable guidance from the FDA and EMA, we will be monitoring patients in a separate long-term follow up protocol to evaluate safety for up to 15 years, and will also monitor efficacy endpoints to demonstrate a sustained treatment effect. 
 In September 2018, we presented updated clinical data at the Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM). All data presented and summarized below are as of the data cut-off date of April 25, 2018, except as otherwise indicated below:
  
o | 31 patients are enrolled in the study. Of these 31 patients, 29 have been treated with Lenti-D and the median follow-up for all treated patients was 34 months, with a range of 0.4 to 54 months.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | 17 patients have completed 24 months of follow-up (median of 41.4 months, ranging from 13.4 to 54.0 months), of which 15 patients are alive and MFD-free. One patient withdrew from the study and was referred for allogeneic HSCT, and one died following rapid disease progression and development of MFDs beginning early in their participation in the study post-treatment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 10


 
o | In the 15 patients who completed 24 months of follow-up, 14 were negative for GdE as of their last MRI. Eleven patients in the study had intermittent hazy re-emergence of GdE-positivity at various follow-up assessments, however, post-treatment GdE positivity was markedly reduced in intensity and does not appear to correlate with clinical outcome.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In the 15 patients who met 24 months of follow up by April 25, 2018; 14 had an NFS score ≤1 at their last follow-up visit, and one patient had an increase in NFS from 1 to 2, due to vision impairment and non-febrile seizures.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | An additional 12 patients have received Lenti-D, but have not reached the primary endpoint of 24-month follow-up, there have been no MFDs reported. The median follow-up for this additional cohort of patients is 4.2 months, with a range of 0.4 to 11.7 months. Since SSIEM and as of the Annual Child Neurology Society Meeting in October 2018, one additional patient withdrew from the study at investigator discretion due to neuroimaging changes with no changes in neurological function noted.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | No acute or chronic GVHD has been reported post-Lenti-D treatment. The safety profile of Lenti-D is generally consistent with myeloablative conditioning with busulfan and cyclophosphamide. Three adverse events (AE) have been deemed potentially related to treatment with Lenti-D and include BK-mediated viral cystitis (grade 3), tachycardia (grade 1), and vomiting (grade 1).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ALD-103 study – Observational study
--+----------------------------------------

 We are also conducting the ALD-103 study, an observational prospective and retrospective data collection study of 60 patients with CALD ≤17 years of age who received allogeneic HSCT.  This study is ongoing and designed to collect efficacy and safety outcomes data in patients who have undergone allogeneic HSCT in a period that is contemporaneous with the Starbeam study.  We anticipate that our Lenti-D product candidate safety and efficacy will be evaluated by the FDA and EMA in light of the data collected in the Starbeam study in conjunction with our retrospective observational ALD-101 study and our retrospective and prospective observational ALD-103 study.
 In September 2018, we presented interim clinical data from the ALD-103 study at SSIEM. All data presented and summarized below are as of the data cut-off date of April 25, 2018:
  
o | 41 pediatric patients were enrolled in the ALD-103 study and had undergone allogeneic HSCT. Thirty-one patients received cells from unrelated donors and 10 received cells from a related donor. The median baseline NFS for the group was 0.0, with a range of 0.0 to 4.0. The median Loes score was 3.0, with a range of 0.0 to 16.0. Twenty-five patients had early cerebral disease, defined as having evidence of cerebral disease established by GdE positivity or Loes score ≥0.5, Loes score ≤9.0, and NFS ≤1.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Initial results were in line with safety and efficacy outcomes reported in the literature for allogeneic HSCT in patients with CALD. Two-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of MFD-free survival post-allogeneic HSCT, were 78 percent for patients with early disease (n=25) and 71 percent for all patients (n=41).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Transplant-related mortality was defined as death due to any transplantation-related cause other than disease progression. There were six transplant-related deaths at one year (14.6 percent); 2 among patients with early disease; none of the six patients had a matched sibling donor. Engraftment failure was reported in five patients (12 percent), all with early disease; none of these patients had a matched sibling donor and all received a second transplant.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Of the 41 patients who received allogeneic HSCT, 34 percent (n=14) experienced either grade ≥2 acute GVHD or chronic GVHD. Twenty-five percent of patients who received cells from a matched sibling donor experienced either grade ≥2 acute GVHD or chronic GVHD.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our collaboration with Boston Children’s Hospital in SCD
 We are collaborating with investigators at Boston Children’s Hospital, or BCH, to advance a product candidate that utilizes a lentiviral vector delivering a short hairpin RNA, or shRNA, embedded in a microRNA, or miRNA, which is commonly known as a shMIR, to suppress the genetic target BCL11a to upregulate fetal hemoglobin to treat patients with SCD.  We have an exclusive license to this program and the related intellectual property from BCH.
 In December 2018, BCH presented initial clinical data from the investigator-initiated phase I study at the ASH Annual Meeting. All data presented at the ASH Annual Meeting and summarized here are as of the data cut-off date of July 28, 2018. One patient had received treatment with BCL11a shMIR. In the patient’s immature red blood cells, expression of the BCL11A protein was reduced by approximately 90 percent compared to levels prior to gene therapy. At 76 days following treatment this patient had a sustained total hemoglobin level of >10 g/dL and, compared to what was observed pre-gene therapy, there was a notable absence of irreversibly sickled cells as assessed by peripheral blood smear, a blood test used to identify abnormalities in the number or shape of blood cells. The safety profile of the drug product was consistent with myeloablative conditioning, and there have been no product-related adverse events and no SCD-related complications.

Our preclinical research opportunities in severe genetic diseases
 We believe our current gene therapy platform will enable us to develop and test new vectors based on similar viral vector backbones that carry different gene sequences for other severe genetic diseases. In this way, we believe that we can advance products efficiently through preclinical into clinical development. We may consider research and development programs targeting other monogenic, genetic diseases that involve cells derived from HSCs for use in the ex vivo setting. These programs may involve severe genetic and rare diseases that could be developed and potentially commercialized on our own.
 In addition, we believe our expertise in gene editing and cell transduction also provides an opportunity to develop new products for use in the in vivo setting. In this case, homing endonucleases and megaTALs that provide a highly specific and efficient way to modify DNA sequences to edit or insert genetic components would be delivered directly to the disease site (e.g., to the brain, liver or eye) or into the bloodstream of the patient and, in vivo deliver the genetic material to or modify those target cells. We believe in vivo gene editing opens up additional rare disease and large market indications where this approach is more appropriate for the disease and targeted cells. 
 Our Programs in CAR and TCR T Cell Technologies
 Like our programs for HSCs, our T cell-based immunotherapies use a customized lentiviral vector to alter T cells ex vivo, or outside the body, so that the T cells can recognize specific proteins or protein fragments on the surface of cancer cells in order to kill these diseased cells.  T cells that have been genetically-engineered to make CAR or TCRs are designed to help a patient’s immune system overcome survival mechanisms employed by cancer cells. CAR T cell technology directs T cells to recognize cancer cells based on expression of specific cell surface antigens, whereas TCR T cell technology provides the T cells with a specific T cell receptor that recognizes protein fragments derived from either intracellular or extracellular proteins which are displayed on the tumor cell surface. For both our CAR and TCR T cell technologies, we harvest a patient’s white blood cells in a process called leukapheresis, activate certain T cells to grow and then use a lentiviral vector to transfer the gene sequences for the CAR or TCR construct into the T cell DNA. Once returned to the patient, these genetically engineered cells engage the target protein on the cancer cell, triggering a series of signals that result in tumor cell killing, the production of anti-cancer cytokines, and multiple rounds of cell division to greatly expand the number of these anti-cancer T cells in the patient. These engineered T cells have the natural “auto-regulatory” capability of normal T cells and once the tumor cells containing the target antigen are destroyed, the engineered T cells decrease in number, but with the potential to leave a smaller number of memory T cells in the body as a form of immune surveillance against potential tumor regrowth. The genetically-engineered T cells are designed to supplement a patient’s immune system and may be further engineered to overcome immune evasion mechanisms employed by cancer cells.
 Our CAR and TCR T cell technologies also bring genomic engineering tools to the immunotherapy field.  For instance, we are exploring applications of our CAR and TCR T cell technologies in combination with novel proteins based on synthetic biology. These technologies may potentially allow our future T cell-based product candidates to detect the tumor microenvironment or, in the case of future CAR T cell product candidates, to be regulated by small molecules. In addition, using our gene editing technology, we potentially have a number of additional options to manipulate the genome of the cancer patient’s T cells to further increase the specificity of the anti-tumor activity and to potentially make these cells even more potent.  Specificity and potency are essential to the development of T cell therapies that can effectively treat solid tumor cancers such as breast, lung and colon cancer.  Our cancer immunotherapy research group is staffed by scientists drawn from both industry and academic research centers that have pioneered the field of T cell therapy.  This team is focused on the next generation of T cell engineering to discover and develop T cell product candidates to treat a variety of hematologic and solid tumor malignancies.
Our collaboration with Celgene focuses on CAR T cell product candidates directed against BCMA, a protein expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells, plasma cells and some mature B cells. We are developing, in collaboration with Celgene, our bb2121 and bb21217 product candidates with the goal of filing for regulatory approval in multiple myeloma on a global basis. We also have collaborations in the field of cancer with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, for the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel cell therapies; with Medigene AG, through its subsidiary Medigene Immunotherapies GmbH, to discover TCR product candidates; with Gritstone Oncology, Inc., to validate targets and discover TCR product candidates; and with TC Biopharm Limited, in the research and development of gamma delta CAR T cells. 
 The anti-BCMA CAR T cell product candidates: bb2121 and bb21217

 In collaboration with Celgene, we are developing the bb2121 and bb21217 product candidates, with the goal of filing for regulatory approval in multiple myeloma on a global basis.  bb2121 and bb21217 both bind to BCMA, a cell surface protein expressed on cancer cells. Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy that develops in the bone marrow in which normal antibody-producing plasma cells transform into myeloma. The growth of the cancer cells in the bone marrow blocks production of normal blood cells and antibodies, and also causes lesions that weaken the bone. BCMA is expressed on normal plasma cells, some mature B cells, and on malignant multiple myeloma cells, but is believed to be is absent from other normal tissues.

Collaboration with Celgene
 The bb2121 and bb21217 product candidates arose from our multi-year collaboration with Celgene. Since our collaboration arrangement with Celgene was announced in March 2013, we have worked collaboratively to discover, develop and commercialize CAR T cell product candidates in oncology. Our collaboration arrangement with Celgene was amended in June 2015 to focus on CAR T cell product candidates targeting BCMA. In March 2018, we entered into an agreement with Celgene to co-develop and co-promote bb2121 in the United States, in which both parties will share equally in costs and profits on terms described more fully below under “Strategic collaborations—Our strategic alliance with Celgene.” In September 2017, Celgene exercised its option to obtain an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize bb21217, and we retain an option to co-develop and co-commercialize this product candidate.
 In January 2019, Celgene announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, will acquire Celgene, and that the transaction is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2019. The acquisition of Celgene by BMS may result in organizational and personnel changes, shifts in business focus or other developments that may have a material adverse effect on our collaboration with Celgene. There is no guarantee that BMS will place the same emphasis on the collaboration or on the development and commercialization of the bb2121 or bb21217 product candidates.  
 Development of the bb2121 and bb21217 product candidates
 In collaboration with Celgene, we are developing the bb2121 and bb21217 product candidates, with the goal for filing for regulatory approval in multiple myeloma on a global basis. The FDA and EMA have granted Orphan Drug status to both bb2121 and bb21217 product candidates for the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.  The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation and the EMA has granted PRIME eligibility to the bb2121 product candidate for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. We and Celgene anticipate a potential approval of the bb2121 product candidate for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in the second half of 2020.
 For the development of the bb2121 product candidate, Celgene is conducting, or is planning to conduct, the following clinical studies in multiple myeloma:
  
• | CRB-401, an open label, single-arm, multicenter, phase 1 study of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In February 2016 we announced that the first patient had been treated in this study. The final patient in this study was treated in February 2018.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | KarMMa (MM-001), an open label, single-arm, multicenter, phase 2 study of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In February 2018, Celgene announced that the first patient had been treated in this registration-enabling study, and in November 2018, Celgene announced that enrollment for this study is complete.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | KarMMa-2 (MM-002), the planned multi-cohort, open-label, multicenter phase 2 study of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma and in high-risk multiple myeloma. Celgene has announced that it expects to initiate this study in 2019.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | KarMMa-3 (MM-003), the planned multicenter, randomized, open-label phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of bb2121 versus standard triplet regimens in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Celgene has announced that it expects to initiate this study in 2019.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A planned multicenter phase 2 study of patients with newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma. Celgene has announced that it expects to initiate this study in the second half of 2019.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For the development of the bb21217 product candidate, we are conducting the CRB-402 study, an open label, single-arm, multicenter, phase 1 study of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In September 2017, we announced that the first patient had been treated in this study. 
 Clinical results of bb2121 and bb21217 product candidates
  
• | The CRB-401 study – phase 1 study of bb2121 for the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our CRB-401 study is a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, multi-site phase 1 dose escalation/ dose expansion clinical study in the United States to examine the safety and efficacy of our bb2121 product candidate in up to 50 patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In order to be eligible for CRB-401, patients must have received three prior regimens, including a proteasome inhibitor (PI; bortezomib or carfilzomib) and an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD; lenalidomide or pomalidomide), or be “double-refractory” to both a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent.  In the expansion cohort, patients must have received at least a PI, an IMiD and daratumumab, and be refractory to their last line of therapy. Patients receive one cycle of lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine prior to infusion of the bb2121 drug product. In September 2017, we announced that the expansion cohort of the study had been initiated with first patient treated, and the final patient enrolled in this study was treated in February 2018.

The primary endpoint of the study is the incidence of adverse events and abnormal laboratory test results, including dose-limiting toxicities. The study also seeks to assess disease-specific response including: complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), and partial response (PR) according to the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma. The study also seeks to determine the maximally tolerated dose and recommended dose for further clinical trials. Each patient is followed for up to 60 months post-treatment, and then is enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy beyond the 60-month period.
 In June 2018, we and Celgene presented updated clinical data from the CRB-401 study at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting, or ASCO. All data presented at ASCO and summarized below are as of the data cut-off date of March 29, 2018: 
  
o | 43 patients had been enrolled and treated in either the dose-escalation cohort of the study, at four dose levels (50 x 106, 150 x 106, 450 x 106 and 800 x 106 CAR T cells), or in the dose expansion cohort in a dose range between 150 and 450 x 106 CAR T cells. Patients in the study were heavily pre-treated, with a median of seven prior myeloma treatment regimens (with a range of 3 to 14) in the dose escalation cohort (n=21), and with a median of eight prior regimens (with a range of 3 to 23) in the dose expansion cohort (n=22). Approximately 90% of the patients had received prior treatment with two IMiD therapies, two proteasome inhibitors, daratumumab and an autologous stem cell transplant.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Response outcomes in patients evaluable for efficacy, with at least 2 months of response data or progressive disease/ death within 2 months were as follows:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


CAR T cell dose level | 50 x 106 | 150 x 106 | > 150 x 106 
N | 3 | 14 | 22 
Median follow up (min, max) | 84 days (59, 94) | 87 days (36, 638) | 194 days (46, 556)
Measures: | | | 
Overall response rate (ORR) | 33.3% | 57.1% | 95.5% 
Complete response (CR) | 0% | 42.9% | 50% 
Very good partial response (VGPR) | 0% | 7.1% | 36.4% 
Median duration of response (mDOR) | 1.9 months | Not estimable | 10.8 months 


o | Responses were dose-related and observed for both low and high BCMA expression levels. In patients treated with 450 x 106 CAR T cells whose myeloma cells expressed low levels of BCMA (0 to 50% of cells BCMA positive), 8 of 8 had a response. In those expressing high BCMA (≥50% BCMA positive), 10 of 11 had a response.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The median progression-free survival (PFS) estimate for patients in the dose-escalation phase treated at active doses (≥150 x 106 CAR T cells) was 11.8 months (95% CI 8.8, NE), while patients receiving 50 x 106 CAR T cells had a median PFS of 2.7 months (95% CI 1.0, 2.9).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In the dose-escalation and expansion phase of the study, all patients who responded and were evaluable for minimal residual disease (MRD as measured by adaptive next-generation sequencing assay) (n=16) were MRD negative at one or more time points. Additionally, two patients who did not have a response and were evaluated for MRD were MRD positive at month one. The median PFS estimate in MRD negative responders (n=16) was 17.7 months (95% CI: 5.8, NE).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Among all infused patients (n=43), 63% had cytokine release syndrome (CRS), mostly Grade 1 & 2, with 2 patients experiencing Grade 3 CRS (5%). Nine patients (21%) received tocilizumab, including 4 patients (9%) who also received steroids and the median duration of CRS was 6 days (1, 32). For patients receiving 150 x 106 CAR T cells (n=18), the rate of CRS was 39% with no grade 3 cases. For patients receiving ≥150 x 106 CAR T cells (n=22), the rate of CRS was 82% with 9.1% of patients experiencing grade 3 events. Also among all infused patients, there were 14 patients (33%) who experienced neurotoxicity, with one patient experiencing a grade 3 or higher event. Other frequent Grade 3/4 AEs included cytopenias commonly associated with lymphodepleting chemotherapy such as neutropenia (79%), thrombocytopenia (51%) and anemia (44%), as well as infection (any grade) with a frequency of 61% overall and 23% in the first month. Grade 3 or higher infection occurred with a frequency of 21% overall and 5% in the first month.

• | The CRB-402 study – phase 1 clinical study of bb21217 for the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our CRB-402 study is a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, multi-site phase 1 dose escalation/ dose expansion clinical study in the United States to examine the safety and efficacy of our bb21217 product candidate in up to 50 patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In order to be eligible for CRB-402, patients must have received three prior regimens, including a proteasome inhibitor (PI: bortezomib or carfilzomib) and immunomodulatory agent (IMiD: lenalidomide or pomalidomide), or be “double-refractory” to both a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent.  In the expansion cohort, patients must have received at least a PI, and IMiD and daratumumab, and be refractory to their last line of therapy. Patients receive one cycle of lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine prior to infusion of the bb21217 drug product. In September 2017, we announced the treatment of the first patient with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in this study.
The primary endpoint of the study is the incidence of adverse events and abnormal laboratory test results, including dose-limiting toxicities. The study also seeks to assess disease-specific response including: complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), and partial response (PR) according to the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma. The study also seeks to determine the maximally tolerated dose and recommended dose for further clinical trials. Each patient will be followed for up to 60 months post-treatment, and then will be enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy beyond the 60-month period.
 In December 2018, we and Celgene presented clinical data from the CRB-402 study at the ASH Annual Meeting. All data presented at the ASH Annual Meeting and summarized below are as of the data cut-off date of October 18, 2018:
  
o | 12 patients had been enrolled and treated in the dose-escalation cohort of the study, all at the 150 x 106 CAR T cells dose level. Patients had a median age of 63 years (with a range of 44 to 69 years). They had received a median of seven prior lines of therapy (with a range of 4 to 17 lines) and 83 percent of patients received a prior autologous stem cell transplant. Fifty-eight percent (n=7) of patients had high-risk cytogenetics.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The median follow-up after treatment was 26 weeks (with a range of 4 to 51 weeks). The primary endpoint is safety measured by frequency of adverse events (AEs), dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and changes in laboratory results. Secondary endpoints include disease specific response criteria based on the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Of the 12 patients who received treatment with bb21217, 83 percent (n=10) achieved an objective clinical response by IMWG criteria. As of the data extract, responses are ongoing in nine of 10 patients, including three with a complete response (CR) or stringent complete response (sCR), two with a very good partial response (VGPR) and four with a partial response (PR).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Evidence of myeloma in the bone marrow, known as minimal residual disease (MRD), was undetectable at a minimum of two time points, by next-generation sequencing at a sensitivity level of 10-5 or better in all responders who had evaluable bone marrow samples (n=4) with some as early as day 15.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | CAR T cell expansion was observed during the first 30 days following treatment in all evaluable patients (n=11) with anti-BCMA CAR T cells showing sustained persistence in all patients (3/3) with six or more months of follow-up.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The safety results were manageable and consistent with known toxicities of CAR T therapies. Eight of the 12 patients (67 percent) treated with bb21217 developed cytokine release syndrome (CRS); four Grade 1, three Grade 2, one Grade 3 case and no Grade 4 cases. Additionally, three of the 12 patients (25 percent) experienced neurotoxicity, including one Grade 1, one Grade 2 and one Grade 4 case. All CRS and neurotoxicity events resolved and no deaths occurred on study. Following the Grade 4 neurotoxicity event, patients were divided into two groups based on tumor burden and dosing continued at 150 x 106 CAR T cells for a total of 12 patients treated at this dose level.

 Our other preclinical research opportunities in cancer
 We are pursuing multiple programs that leverage the unique properties of lentiviral vectors to target T cells as a therapy for various cancers. This represents a direct application of our expertise in gene therapy and our capabilities, know-how and patents associated with lentiviral gene therapy and gene editing for ex vivo applications. We have programs at various stages of research and preclinical development through our collaborations with Regeneron, Medigene AG, Gritstone Oncology, Inc., and TC Biopharm Limited against a variety of targets relevant to both hematologic and solid tumors. We also have academic collaborations at various stages or research and preclinical development at the University of North Carolina and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. We are also independently researching and developing other CAR T cell product candidates against a variety of cancer targets.

Our Gene Editing Capabilities 
 In June 2014, we acquired Pregenen, a privately-held biotechnology company headquartered in Seattle, Washington. Through the acquisition, we obtained rights to Pregenen’s gene editing technology platform and cell signaling technology. Since the acquisition, we have integrated these technologies and research team and we have expanded the scope of our research efforts in this area.  We are focused on utilizing homing endonuclease and megaTAL gene editing technologies in a variety of potential applications and disease areas, including for oncology and hematology.  Homing endonucleases and megaTALs are novel enzymes that provide a highly specific and efficient way to modify the genome of a target cell to potentially treat a variety of diseases. 
 All of the gene-editing technologies currently being explored by the pharmaceutical industry, including zinc finger nucleases, CRISPR/Cas9, and TALENs, share common features of a DNA binding domain and a DNA cleavage domain.  They all differ in specificity, size, ease of delivery and as naturally occurring versus engineered nucleases.  Homing endonucleases and megaTALs are based on a naturally-occurring class of DNA cleaving enzymes that function as monomeric proteins able to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner and cleave their target site. We believe there are multiple advantages of homing endonucleases and megaTALs compared to other gene editing technologies, most notably: they are highly specific and efficient in cutting DNA and their compact size simplifies delivery to therapeutically relevant cell types.  We are using our gene editing platform, along with collaborations with multiple academic institutions, to potentially discover and develop next generation versions of our current ex vivo gene therapy product candidates, and to potentially expand into new disease indications.
 Manufacturing 
 Our gene therapy platform has two main components: lentiviral vector production and the target cell transduction process, which results in drug product. 
 Our lentiviral manufacturing process 
 Our lentiviral vectors are assembled using a human cell line called HEK293T. The HEK293T cells are maintained in disposable flasks until sufficient cell mass has been generated to fill approximately 40 ten tray cell factories, or TTCFs, then transferred and allowed to adhere to the bottom of the trays.  Adherent cells are transfected with multiple plasmids encoding all the genetic material required to assemble the lentiviral vector carrying the functional gene of interest.  The transfected HEK293T cells then assemble our lentiviral vectors packaged with the functional gene of interest, which bud off into the cell culture media. The media containing the assembled vectors is harvested, purified, concentrated and formulated prior to freezing for storage. These finished lentiviral vectors are what is ultimately used to transduce the targeted cells isolated from the patient. 
 We believe that our lentiviral vectors have broad applicability, since the majority of the viral production system can remain the same, while we change only the therapeutic gene “cassette” depending on the disease. In other words, the vector “backbone” stays the same, while only the therapeutic gene and related sequences are changed. If we were to undertake drug development in an additional indication, we believe we could rapidly move forward using this lentiviral vector backbone and associated assays, simply by switching the therapeutic gene insert and associated control elements. 
 Although we intend to continue manufacturing our Lenti-D vectors in TTCFs, we are adapting our LentiGlobin, bb2121 and bb21217 vector production technology to scalable production systems with the potential to satisfy an increased number of patients per manufacturing cycle, and we have demonstrated successful production of our LentiGlobin, bb2121 and bb21217 vectors at the scale we believe will support potential commercial demand. We intend to use a mix of internal and third-party manufacturing capabilities to accommodate future demand for our drug candidates, if approved, in their current indications as well as those beyond our initial focus.  
 Our HSC transduction process in severe genetic disease 
 In severe genetic disease, the ultimate product of our manufacturing processes is the patient’s own gene-modified HSC cells, which we refer to as our drug product. The process for producing drug product for our HSC-based product candidates is as follows: 
  
1. | Selection: We extract HSCs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from the patient’s blood by apheresis following mobilization via a colony stimulating factor (or previously in SCD, by bone marrow harvest). The process is carried out using existing hospital infrastructure and standard protocols currently in place for stem cell transplant procedures, with enhanced controls for extracting the cells to be used for making our drug product.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Pre-stimulation: The isolated HSCs are treated with a mixture of growth factors that help enable an efficient transduction process.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 16


 
3. | Transduction: The isolated, purified and pre-treated HSCs are exposed to our lentiviral vectors containing the appropriate functional gene and additional proprietary elements for a period of time to facilitate transduction and insertion of the therapeutic DNA into the genome of the target cells.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Final harvest: Once transduction is complete, the gene-modified HSCs are washed and re-suspended into cell culture media to remove any residual impurities. A portion of the harvested cells is removed for quality control release testing, which includes ensuring that transduction was successful and the functional gene delivered by the vector is adequately expressed by the target cells.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Formulation and freeze: The remaining cells are appropriately formulated and cryopreserved.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The final step is to return the gene-modified HSCs to the patient. 
 Our T cell transduction process in cancer 
 In cancer, the ultimate product of our manufacturing processes is the patient’s own gene-modified T cells, which we refer to as our drug product. The process for producing drug product for our T cell-based product candidates is as follows: 
  
1. | Leukapheresis: We collect white blood cells from the patient’s blood through a process called leukapheresis. The process is carried out using existing hospital infrastructure and standard protocols currently in place for blood donation procedures, with enhanced controls for extracting the cells to be used for making our drug product.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Activation: The white blood cell mixture, which includes T cells, is treated with proprietary processes to enable an efficient transduction process.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Transduction: The isolated, purified and pre-treated T cells are exposed to our lentiviral vectors containing the appropriate functional gene for a period of time to facilitate transduction and insertion of the therapeutic DNA into the genome of the target cells.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Expansion: The transduced T cells are then expanded for a period of approximately one week to increase the number of gene-modified T cells.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Final harvest: The gene-modified T cells are washed and re-suspended into cell culture media to remove any residual impurities. A portion of the harvested cells is removed for quality control release testing, which includes ensuring that transduction was successful and the functional gene delivered by the vector is adequately expressed by the target cells.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Formulation and freeze: The remaining cells are appropriately formulated and cryopreserved.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The final step is to return the gene-modified T cells to the patient.  
 Manufacturing Arrangements  
 In November 2017, we purchased a partially completed manufacturing facility located in Durham, North Carolina for $11.5 million. We acquired this 125,000 square foot facility to provide manufacturing capacity for our lentiviral vectors in support of our current and planned gene and cell therapy product candidates. We currently expect that our facility will begin to produce lentiviral vector in 2021. We have also entered into multi-year agreements with external manufacturing partners in the United States and Europe (Brammer Bio, Novasep and SAFC Carlsbad, Inc., or SAFC, a subsidiary of MilliporeSigma), which are partnering with us on production of lentiviral vector across all of our programs. In addition, we have entered into multi-year agreements with Lonza Houston, Inc. and apceth Biopharma, or apceth, to produce drug product for Lenti-D, LentiGlobin and bb21217.  Currently, SAFC is the sole manufacturer of the lentiviral vector and apceth is the sole manufacturer of the drug product to support our potential commercial launch of LentiGlobin in Europe for the treatment of TDT. In our manufacturing agreement with SAFC, we are required to provide rolling forecasts for products on a quarterly basis, a portion of which will be considered a binding, firm order, subject to a purchase commitment. In our manufacturing agreement with apceth, we reserve production capacity for the manufacture of our drug product. In January 2019, apceth announced that it has entered into an agreement to be acquired by Hitachi Chemical Co. Ltd., in a transaction expected to close in April 2019. Celgene manufactures drug product for bb2121.  We believe our team of technical personnel has extensive manufacturing, analytical and quality experience as well as strong project management discipline to effectively oversee these contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions and potential commercial launch. We are engaging in negotiations with apheresis centers that will be the centers for collection of HSCs from the patient and for infusion of drug product to the patient. For the treatment of patients with our drug product in the commercial setting, we intend to partner with participating apheresis centers, which we refer to as qualified treatment centers. In anticipation of the potential regulatory approval of LentiGlobin in Europe, we expect to first engage qualified treatment centers in Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom in 2019.

Commercial Operations
 Subject to approval from the EMA of our LentiGlobin product candidate for the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with TDT and non-β0/β0 genotypes, we expect to launch LentiGlobin in various jurisdictions in Europe in 2019. As we plan our potential transition into a commercial-stage company, we have started to build commercial operations in the United States and Europe with a goal of delivering LentiGlobin to patients through qualified treatment centers. In the course of preparing for a potential commercial launch in 2019, we have begun a staged build of commercial capabilities by adding employees with broad experience in quality assurance and compliance, medical education, marketing, supply chain, sales, public policy, patient services, market access and product reimbursement. We expect to continue expansion of these capabilities throughout 2019 and beyond as we continue to implement appropriate quality systems, compliance policies, systems and procedures, as well as internal systems and infrastructure in order to support our complex supply chain, qualify and train treatment centers, establish patient-focused programs, educate healthcare professionals, and secure reimbursement. The timing and conduct of these commercial activities will be dependent upon regulatory approvals and on agreements we have made or may make in the future with strategic collaborators. As part of the commercialization process, we are engaged in discussions with stakeholders across the healthcare system, including public and private payors, patient advocates and organizations, professional societies, and healthcare providers, to explore new payment models that we hope will enable access to more patients. Ultimately, we intend to utilize the commercial infrastructure that we build to support the potential for multiple product launches sequentially across multiple geographies. For many territories and countries, we may also elect to utilize strategic partners, distributors, or contract field-based teams to assist in the commercialization of our products. 
Strategic Collaborations 
 Our objective is to develop and commercialize products based on the transformative potential of gene therapy to treat patients with severe genetic diseases and cancer. To access the substantial funding and other resources required to develop and commercialize gene therapy products in these diseases, we have formed, and intend to seek other opportunities to form, strategic collaborations with third parties who can augment our industry leading gene therapy, T cell immunotherapy, lentiviral vector and gene-editing expertise. To date, we have focused on forging a limited number of significant strategic collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies and academic research centers where both parties contribute expertise to enable the discovery and development of potential product candidates. 
 Our strategic collaborations include relationships with:
  
• | Celgene, in the development of the bb2121 and bb21217 product candidates in multiple myeloma;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regeneron, in the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel cell therapies for cancer;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Medigene AG, to discover TCR product candidates in the field of cancer;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Gritstone Oncology, Inc., to validate targets and discover TCR product candidates in the field of cancer; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | TC BioPharm Limited, in the research and development of gamma delta CAR T cells directed at hematologic and solid tumor targets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our collaboration with Celgene 
 In March 2013, we announced a strategic collaboration with Celgene to discover, develop and commercialize chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells, or CAR T cells, as potentially disease-altering gene therapies in oncology, which was amended and restated in June 2015, and amended again in February 2016 and in September 2017. The multi-year research and development collaboration focused on applying our expertise in gene therapy technology to CAR T cell-based therapies, to target and destroy cancer cells. The research collaboration term ended in June 2018, with the bb2121 and bb21217 product candidates arising from the collaboration. 
 In February 2016, Celgene exercised its option with respect to the bb2121 product candidate, and we exclusively licensed to Celgene the worldwide rights to develop and commercialize the bb2121 product candidate, while retaining an option to co-develop and co-promote the bb2121 product candidate in the United States. In connection with its exercise of its option to obtain an exclusive license, Celgene paid to us an option fee in the amount of $10.0 million. In March 2018, we exercised our option to co-develop and co-promote the bb2121 product candidate in the United States. Under the terms of the co-development and co-promotion agreement that we have with Celgene for the development and commercialization of bb2121, we share equally in all costs relating to developing, commercializing and manufacturing the product candidate within the United States and we would share equally in the United States profits. We are also entitled to receive up to $10.0 million in clinical milestone payments and outside of the United States, up to $54.0 million in regulatory milestone payments and up to $36.0 million in commercial milestone payments. In addition, to the extent that bb2121 is commercialized, we are entitled to receive tiered royalty payments ranging from the mid-single digits to low-teens based on a percentage of net sales generated outside of the United States. The royalties payable to us are subject to certain reductions, including any royalty payments required to be made by Celgene to acquire patent rights, with an aggregate minimum floor.

Effective as of September 2017, Celgene has exercised its option with respect to the bb21217 product candidate, and we have exclusively licensed to Celgene the worldwide rights to develop and commercialize the bb21217 product candidate, while retaining an option to co-develop and co-promote the bb21217 product candidate in the United States on terms substantially similar to the co-development and co-promotion arrangement for the bb2121 product candidate. In connection with its exercise of its option to obtain an exclusive license, Celgene paid to us an option fee in the amount of $15.0 million. Under the terms of the license agreement with Celgene for the exclusive rights to the development and commercialization of bb21217, we are and will be responsible for conducting and funding all research and development activities performed up through completion of the CRB-402 study. Celgene has agreed to reimburse us a specified amount per patient in the event we and Celgene mutually agree to expand the trial beyond a specified number of patients per clinical trial. In addition, if we do not exercise our option to co-develop and co-promote the bb21217 product candidate in the United States, we will also be eligible to receive up to $10.0 million in clinical milestone payments, up to $117.0 million in regulatory milestone payments and up to $78.0 million in commercial milestone payments, as well as a percentage of net sales as a royalty in a range from the mid-single digits to low-teens. The royalties payable to us are subject to certain reductions, including for any royalty payments required to be made by Celgene to acquire patent rights, with an aggregate minimum floor. Celgene will assume certain development obligations and must report on their progress in achieving these milestones on a quarterly basis. 
 Our collaboration with Celgene is governed by a joint governance committee, or JGC, formed by representatives from us and Celgene. The JGC, among other activities, reviews and approves development and commercialization plans and budgets for activities in the United States. The parties share responsibility for the manufacture and supply of the bb2121 product candidate and, if we exercise our option to co-develop and co-promote, of the bb21217 product candidate. Prior to the exercise of our option to co-develop and co-promote the bb21217 product candidate, Celgene is solely responsible for all costs and expenses of manufacturing and supplying the bb21217 product candidate beyond the requirements for conducting the CRB-402 study. Subject to customary “back-up” supply rights granted to Celgene, we have the sole right to manufacture or have manufactured supplies of vectors and associated payloads manufactured for incorporation into the optioned product candidates. Celgene will reimburse us for our costs to manufacture and supply such vectors and associated payloads, plus a mark-up. 
 We received an initial up-front payment of $75.0 million from Celgene in connection with the collaboration, plus an additional $25.0 million in connection with the amendment in June 2015. Either party may terminate the agreements upon written notice to the other party in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. Celgene may terminate the agreement for any reason upon prior written notice to us. If the agreements are terminated, rights to product candidates in development at the time of such termination will be allocated to the parties through a mechanism included in the agreements. In addition, if Celgene has the right to terminate any co-development and co-promotion agreement or license agreement for our breach, Celgene may elect to continue such agreement however, any amounts payable by Celgene to us under such agreement will be reduced. 
 In January 2019, Celgene announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement under which BMS will acquire Celgene, and that the transaction is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2019. The acquisition of Celgene by BMS may result in organizational and personnel changes, shifts in business focus or other developments that may have a material adverse effect on our collaboration with Celgene. There is no guarantee that BMS will place the same emphasis on the collaboration or on the development and commercialization of the bb2121 or bb21217 product candidates.

 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. 
 The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a BLA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use. 
 We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and third parties. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
 License agreements 
 Inserm-Transfert 
 In May 2009, we entered into an exclusive license with Inserm-Transfert, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale, for use of certain patents and know-how related to the ABCD1 gene and corresponding protein, for use in the field of human ALD therapy. Inserm-Transfert is referred to herein as Inserm. The last patent in the Inserm licensed patent portfolio expired in February of 2016.  Inserm retains the right to practice the intellectual property licensed under the agreement for educational, clinical and preclinical studies purposes.

Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include our Lenti-D product candidate, we will be obligated to pay Inserm a percentage of net sales as a royalty for the longer of the life of any patents covering the product or 10 years from first commercial sale. This royalty is in the low single digits. The royalties payable to Inserm are subject to reduction for any third party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits. 
 We are required to use all commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products and introduce them into the commercial market as soon as practical, consistent with our reasonable business practices and judgment in compliance with an agreed upon development plan. We have assumed certain development, regulatory and commercial milestone obligations and must report on our progress in achieving these milestones on an annual basis. 
 We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement at any time. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s material breach which remains uncured after 60 days of receiving written notice of such breach or in the event the other party becomes the subject of a voluntary or involuntary petition in bankruptcy and such petition is not dismissed with prejudice within 120 days after filing. In addition, Inserm may terminate the license agreement in the event that we cannot prove within 60 days of written notice from Inserm that we have been diligent in developing the licensed products and introducing them into the commercial market. 
 Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of all issued patents and filed patent applications within the patent rights covered by the agreement or 10 years from the date of first commercial sale of a licensed product, whichever is later. The license grant ceases in connection with any such termination. The longest lived patent rights licensed to us under the agreement expired in 2016. 
 Institut Pasteur 
 We have entered into a license with Institut Pasteur for certain patents relating to the use of DNA sequences, lentiviral vectors and recombinant cells in the field of ex vivo gene therapy and CAR T cell-based therapy in a range of indications, excluding vaccinations. This agreement was amended twice in 2012, again in 2013 and most recently in 2015. The Institut Pasteur licensed patent portfolio includes at least 107 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. Any patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have a statutory expiration dates between 2019 and 2023. The license is exclusive for products containing human and non-human lentiviral vectors. Institut Pasteur retains the right, on behalf of itself, its licensees and research partners, to conduct research using the licensed intellectual property. 
 We have the right to grant sublicenses outright to third parties under the agreement. For the first sublicense including a product targeting β-hemoglobinopathies (including TDT and SCD) or ALD (including CALD and AMN), we must pay Institut Pasteur an additional payment of €3.0 million. If we receive any income (cash or non-cash) in connection with sublicenses for products targeting indications other than β-hemoglobinopathies (including TDT and SCD) or ALD (including CALD and AMN), we must pay Institut Pasteur a percentage of such income varying from low single digits if the sublicense also includes licenses to intellectual property controlled by us, and a percentage of sublicense income in the mid-range double digits if the sublicense does not include licenses to intellectual property controlled by us. 
 Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include our LentiGlobin, Lenti-D, bb2121 and bb21217 product candidates, we will be obligated to pay Institut Pasteur a percentage of net sales as a royalty. This royalty varies depending on the indication of the product but in any event is in the low single digits. In addition, starting in 2016 we must make under this agreement an annual maintenance payment which is creditable against royalty payments on a year-by-year basis. If the combined royalties we would be required to pay to Institut Pasteur and third parties is higher than a pre-specified percentage, we may ask Institut Pasteur to re-negotiate our royalty rates under this relationship. 
 We are required to use all reasonable commercial efforts (as compared to a company of similar size and scope) to develop and commercialize one or more products in the license field and to obtain any necessary governmental approvals in respect of, and market the products in license field, if any. Additionally, we have assumed certain development and regulatory milestone obligations. We must report on our progress towards achieving these milestones on an annual basis. We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement at any time by sending Institut Pasteur 90 days prior written notice. Either party may terminate the license in the event of the other party’s substantial breach which remains uncured after 60 days of receiving written notice of such breach. Institut Pasteur may also terminate the agreement in the event bankruptcy proceedings are opened against us and not dismissed within 60 days. 
 Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of the last licensed patents or five years after first market authorization of the first product, whichever occurs later. In the event the agreement is terminated, while the license grant would cease, we would retain the right to manufacture, import, use and sell licensed products for a certain period of time post-termination. In addition, our ownership stake in certain jointly made improvements covered by the licensed patents would survive termination of the agreement. The longest lived patent rights licensed to us under the agreement are currently expected to expire in 2023.

Stanford University 
 In July 2002, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, referred to herein as Stanford, which we amended and restated in April 2012. Under this agreement, we are granted a license to use the HEK293T cell line for any commercial or non-commercial use for research, nonclinical and clinical development purpose and human and animal gene therapy products. 
 We have the right to grant sublicenses outright to third parties under the agreement. For each such sublicense we grant, we must pay Stanford a fee (unless the sublicense is to a collaborating partner, contract manufacturer or contract research organization). 
 Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include our LentiGlobin, Lenti-D, bb2121 and bb21217 product candidates, we will be obligated to pay Stanford a percentage of net sales as a royalty. This royalty varies with net sales but in any event is in the low single digits and is reduced for each third-party license that requires payments by us with respect to a licensed product, provided that the royalty to Stanford is not less than a specified percentage which is less than one percent. Since April 2013, we have been paying Stanford an annual maintenance fee, which will be creditable against our royalty payments. 
 We may unilaterally terminate the agreement by giving Stanford 30 days’ written notice. Stanford may also terminate the license agreement if after 30 days of providing notice we are delinquent on any report or payment, are not using commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture and/or commercialize one or more licensed products, are in material breach of any provision or provide any false report. Termination of this agreement may require us to utilize different cell types for vector manufacturing, which could lead to delays. 
 Absent early termination, the license will expire in April 2037. We may elect to extend the term for an additional 25 years so long as we have a commercial product on the market at that time and we are in material compliance with the license agreement. 
 Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
 In December 1996, we entered into an exclusive license with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, referred to herein as MIT, for use of certain patents in any field. This license agreement was amended in December 2003, May 2004 and June 2011. The licensed patent portfolio includes at least 18 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. Any patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have a statutory expiration date from 2017-2023. This license also has been amended to include a case jointly owned by MIT and us wherein we received the exclusive license to MIT’s rights in this case. MIT retains the right to practice the intellectual property licensed under the agreement for noncommercial research purposes. 
 We have the right to grant sublicenses outright to third parties under the agreement. In the event we sublicense the patent rights, we must pay MIT a percentage of all payments we receive from by the sublicensee. This percentage varies from mid-single digits to low double digits. 
 Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include our LentiGlobin product candidate, we will be obligated to pay MIT a percentage of net sales by us or our sublicensees as a royalty. This royalty is in the low single digits and is reduced for royalties payable to third parties, provided that the royalty to MIT is not less than a specified percentage that is less than one-percent. In addition, we make under this agreement an annual maintenance payment which may be credited against the royalty payments. 
 We are required to use diligent efforts to market licensed products and to continue active, diligent development and marketing efforts for licensed products during the term of the agreement. We have assumed certain milestones with respect to raising capital investment and regulatory progress. We must report on our progress on achieving these milestones on an annual basis. 
 We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement upon six months’ notice to MIT. MIT may terminate the agreement if we cease to carry on our business, or in the event of our material breach which remains uncured after 90 days of receiving written notice of such breach (30 days in the case of nonpayment). In the event the agreement is terminated, while the license grant would cease, we would retain a right to complete manufacture of any licensed products in process and sell then-existing inventory. In addition, MIT would grant our sublicensees a direct license following such termination. With respect to jointly owned intellectual property, any termination would allow MIT to grant licenses to any third party to such intellectual property, without our approval, unless a sublicensee was already in place, in which case, MIT would grant our sublicensees a direct license.

Research Development Foundation 
 In December 2011, we entered into an exclusive license with RDF to use certain patents that involve lentiviral vectors. The RDF licensed patent portfolio includes at least 29 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. Any patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have an expected statutory expiration date between 2021 and 2027. RDF retains the right, on behalf of itself and other nonprofit academic research institutions, to practice and use the licensed patents for any academic, non-clinical research and educational purposes. We have the right to grant sublicenses outright to third parties under the agreement. 
 Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include both our Lenti-D, LentiGlobin, bb2121 and bb21217 product candidates, we are obligated to pay RDF a percentage of net sales as a royalty. This royalty is in the low single digits and is reduced by half if during the following ten years from the first marketing approval the last valid claim within the licensed patent that covers the licensed product expires or ends. 
 We are required to use commercially reasonable and diligent efforts for a company of our size and resources to develop or commercialize one or more licensed products, including our first licensed product by 2016 and a second licensed product by 2018. These diligence efforts include minimum annual royalty payments to RDF, which are creditable against earned royalties otherwise due to RDF, and payments upon regulatory milestones. 
 RDF may terminate the agreement in the event of our material breach which remains uncured after 90 days of receiving written notice of such breach (30 days in the case of nonpayment) or in the event we become bankrupt, our business or assets or property are placed in the hands of a receiver, assignee or trustee, we institute or suffer to be instituted any procedure in bankruptcy court for reorganization or rearrangement of our financial affairs, make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or if we or an affiliate or a sublicensee institutes any procedure challenging the validity or patentability of any patent or patent application within the licensed patents, the agreement will immediately terminate. 
 Absent early termination, the agreement will continue until its expiration upon the later of there being no more valid claims within the licensed patents or the expiration of our royalty obligations on licensed products that are subject to an earned royalty, if such earned royalty is based on the minimum 10-year royalty period described above. In the event the agreement is terminated, while the license grant would cease, RDF will grant our sublicensees a direct license. The longest lived patent rights licensed to us under the agreement are in one U.S. patent currently expected to expire in 2027.

Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on gene therapy products but any products that we may commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 29


There are other organizations working to improve existing therapies or to develop new therapies for our initially selected indications. Depending on how successful these efforts are, it is possible they may increase the barriers to adoption and success for our product candidates, and our preclinical T cell-based cancer immunotherapy product candidates. These efforts include the following: 
  
• | β-thalassemia: The current standard of care for the treatment of β-thalassemia in the developed world is chronic blood transfusions to address the patient’s anemia. In addition, such patients often receive iron chelation therapy to help manage the iron overload associated with their chronic blood transfusions. Novartis and ApoPharma Inc., who provide the leading iron chelation therapy, are seeking to develop improvements to their product profile and accessibility. A number of different approaches are under investigation that seek to improve the current standard of care treatment options, including, a protein that aims to improve red blood cell production and fetal hemoglobin regulators. Acceleron Pharma, Inc. (in collaboration with Celgene) is investigating luspatercept (ACE-536), a subcutaneously-delivered protein therapeutic that targets molecules in the TGF-β superfamily, which is currently in two phase 3 clinical trials in subjects with transfusion dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) and non-transfusion dependent β-thalassemia. Acceleron and Celgene are planning regulatory submissions of luspatercept in the United States and Europe in the first half of 2019. In addition, some patients with β-thalassemia receive HSCT treatment, particularly if a sufficiently well-matched source of donor cells is identified. In addition, there are a number of academic and industry-sponsored research and development programs to improve the outcomes of allogeneic HSCT, or the tolerability and safety of haploidentical HSCT, while increasing the availability of suitable donors. These programs include a modified donor T cell therapy to be used in conjunction with haploidentical HSCT that is in an ongoing phase 1/2 study supported by Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and an adjunctive T cell immunotherapy treatment in conjunction with allogeneic HSCT that is in ongoing phase 2 and 3 studies supported by Kiadis Pharma. There are also several different groups developing other approaches for β-thalassemia, including one that uses a similar ex vivo autologous gene therapy approach, but uses a different vector and different cell processing techniques and two that use gene editing approaches These include: the San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (in collaboration with Orchard Therapeutics) is currently investigating its gene therapy in a phase 2 study of adults and pediatric patients with in transfusion dependent β-thalassemia (TDT); Sangamo BioSciences Inc. (in collaboration with Bioverativ Inc., a Sanofi company) is investigating ST-400, using a zinc finger nuclease-mediated gene-editing approach currently in an ongoing phase 1/2 study; and CRISPR Therapeutics AG (in collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated) is conducting an ongoing phase 1/2 study for its CTX-001, which leverages the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing platform to disrupt the BCL11A erythroid enhancer.

• | Sickle cell disease: The current standard of care for the treatment of SCD in the developed world is chronic blood transfusions or hydroxyurea (a generic drug). In addition, patients treated with chronic blood transfusions often receive iron chelation therapy to help manage the iron overload. Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. recently received FDA approval for and have launched Endari (L-glutamine). We are aware of ongoing studies that continue to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea in various populations. In addition, a limited number of patients with SCD receive allogeneic HSCT treatment, particularly if a sufficiently well-matched source of donor cells is identified. In addition, there are a number of academic and industry-sponsored research and development programs to improve the tolerability and safety of allogeneic HSCT with less well-matched sources of donor cells, while increasing the availability of suitable donors. These programs include a modified donor T cell therapy to be used in conjunction with haploidentical HSCT that is in an ongoing phase 1/2 study supported by Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. A number of different therapeutic approaches are under investigation targeting the various aspects of SCD pathophysiology, including: antibodies to p-selectin including crizanlizumab currently in a phase 3 study supported by Novartis; hemoglobin modifiers to prevent the sickling of RBC, including voxelotor (GBT440) in an ongoing phase 3 study supported by Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc.; pan-selectin inhibitors, including rivipansel (GMI-1070) in phase 3 studies supported by GlycoMimetics Inc. (in 2011, Pfizer Inc. and GlycoMimetics Inc. entered a global collaboration to advance this compound); and also gene editing approaches being supported by Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (in collaboration with Novartis), Editas Medicine, Inc. and CRISPR Therapeutics AG (in collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated); and Sangamo BioSciences Inc. (in collaboration with Bioverativ). There are also several different groups developing gene therapy approaches for SCD. Some of these groups use a similar ex vivo autologous approach, but make use of different vectors and different cell processing techniques. These include: UCLA, which has received funding from the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine to pursue a phase 1 gene therapy study for SCD; and Aruvant Sciences, Inc.’s RVT-181, currently in a phase 1/2 gene therapy study for SCD.

• | CALD: The current standard of care for the treatment of CALD is allogeneic HSCT. We understand that various academic centers around the world are seeking to develop improvements to allogeneic HSCT, such as Magenta Therapeutic, Inc.’s cord blood expansion technology which is currently being investigated in a phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of inherited metabolic disorders, including adrenoleukodystrophy. Other possible treatments being investigated include Viking Therapeutics, Inc.’s VK0214, a selective thyroid receptor-β agonist, and Orpheris, Inc.’s OP-101.

• | Multiple Myeloma: The current standard of care for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma includes IMIDs (e.g., thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide), proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib), monoclonal antibodies (e.g., daratumamab, elotuzumab), cytotoxic agents, and HSCT. There are several groups developing autologous T cell therapies for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma that use a similar autologous ex vivo approach, but a different target antigen, BCMA single-chain variable fragment or, we believe, cell processing techniques. These programs include: an anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy that is currently in a single-center phase 1 study by the University of Pennsylvania (in collaboration with Novartis AG); an anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy that is in a phase 1b/2 study in the United States (Nanjing Legend in collaboration with Janssen Biotech); a BCMA and TACI-targeted CAR T cell therapy that is currently in a phase 1/2 study (Autolus); an anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy that is in phase 1 study (Poseida Therapeutics, Inc.); and an anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy in clinical development (phase 1/2) sponsored by Celgene following the completion of its acquisition of Juno Therapeutics, Inc. In addition to these autologous T cell-based approaches, Allogene Therapeutics, Inc., Poseida, and CRISPR Therapeutics have disclosed preclinical programs for allogeneic BCMA CAR T cell therapies. There are also therapies using other modalities being developed by several groups, including two bispecific T cell engagers currently in phase 1 studies supported by Amgen Inc., a bispecific antibody therapy currently in a phase 1 study supported by Janssen Research and Development, LLC, a specific antibody therapy currently in a phase 1 study supported by Pfizer, Inc., and an antibody drug conjugate therapy currently in a phase 2 study supported by GSK, and those being developed in preclinical programs.

• | T cell-based immunotherapies in oncology: A number of pharmaceutical companies and academic collaborators are researching and developing T cell-based immunotherapies in oncology, in addition to the multiple myeloma programs described above. These include: Novartis AG (in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania), Adaptimmune Inc., Celgene following its acquisition of Juno Therapeutics, Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc. (in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health), Pfizer Inc. (through their collaboration with Cellectis SA and Servier), Amgen, Inc., among others. Many of the T cell-based immunotherapy programs being developed by these companies are already in phase 1/2 clinical trials for multiple indications.

 Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ treatments may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any treatment we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our treatments. 
 These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. If our therapeutic product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. 
 Government regulation 
 In the United States, biological products, including gene therapy products, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. FDA approval must be obtained before clinical testing of biological products, and each clinical study protocol for a gene therapy product is reviewed by the FDA. FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals. 
 31


Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or the CBER, regulates gene therapy products. The CBER works closely with the NIH. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The FDA also has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy INDs.
Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 
 U.S. biological products development process 
 The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical studies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with GMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices, or GTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any biological product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. 
 Where a gene therapy study is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, in the past, a protocol and related documentation was submitted to and the study was registered with the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Pursuant to the current NIH Guidelines, research involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules must be approved by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA, however many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. Such trials remain subject to FDA and other clinical trial regulations, and only after FDA, IBC, and other relevant approvals are in place can these protocols proceed. 
 32


The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies. 
 Clinical studies involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical studies must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed. 
 Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical studies, sometimes referred to as phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of study subjects. 
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 33


Human gene therapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the study period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the studies in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these studies will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. The NIH has a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System which includes information on gene transfer studies and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these studies.
 Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. review and approval processes 
 After the completion of clinical studies of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA, must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, as amended, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with GMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a gene therapy product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the GTPs. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical studies were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure GMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control. 
 34


Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, or request a hearing. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical studies, sometimes referred to as phase 4 clinical studies, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs in 10 months and 90% of priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
 Orphan drug designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits. 
 Expedited development and review programs 
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. 
 35


Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Under the Breakthrough Therapy program, products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may be eligible for the benefits of the Fast Track program when preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates that such product may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. Additionally, FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product receives timely advice and interactive communications to help the sponsor design and conduct a development program as efficiently as possible. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Regenerative medicine advanced therapies (RMAT) designation
 As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress amended the FD&C Act to facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of regenerative medicine advanced therapies, which include cell and gene therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products.  Regenerative medicine advanced therapies do not include those human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products regulated solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR Part 1271.  This program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of regenerative medicine therapies, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and qualify for RMAT designation.  A drug sponsor may request that FDA designate a drug as a RMAT concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND.  FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition.  A BLA for a regenerative medicine therapy that has received RMAT designation may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through use of surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites.  Benefits of RMAT designation also include early interactions with FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval.  A regenerative medicine therapy with RMAT designation that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence from clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval.
 Post-approval requirements 
 Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to GMP. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the GMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of GMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. 
 36


Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, companies that manufacture or distribute drug or biological products or that hold approved BLAs must comply with other regulatory requirements, including submitting annual reports, reporting information about adverse drug experiences, and maintaining certain records. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a drug’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, including a REMS or the conduct of post-marketing studies to assess a newly-discovered safety issue.
 We also must comply with the FDA’s and other jursidiction’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising and advertising to healthcare professionals, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. Consequences could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare professionals, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. 
 A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 37


A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics’ patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period. 
 Fraud and Abuse Laws
 In addition to restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state/ federal laws and trade association membership codes of conduct have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years.  These laws include anti-kickback and false claims statutes. The U.S. federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs.  This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other.  Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical and biological products, including certain discounts, or engaging healthcare professionals or patients as speakers or consultants, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within the exemption or safe harbor.  Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability.  Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants or patient assistance programs. 
 The U.S. federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government.  In recent years, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under the federal False Claims Act for, among other things, allegedly submitting false or misleading pricing information to government health care programs and providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product.  Other companies have faced enforcement actions for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company’s marketing the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.  Federal enforcement agencies also have showed increased interest in pharmaceutical companies’ product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement and co-pay support services, and a number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements.  In addition, the Affordable Care Act amended federal law to provide that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.  Criminal prosecution is possible for making or presenting a false or fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters.  The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors.  The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.  Several states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual health care providers in those states.  Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers.  In addition, several states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes.
 The U.S. federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to engage in extensive tracking of payments and other transfers of value to prescribers and teaching hospitals, including physician ownership and investment interests, and public reporting of such data.  Pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program are required to track such payments, and must submit a report on or before the 90th day of each calendar year disclosing reportable payments made in the previous calendar year. A number of other countries, states and municipalities have also implemented additional payment tracking and reporting requirements, which if not done correctly may result in additional penalties.
 38


In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity.  It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any official of another country, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in that capacity.  In many other countries, healthcare professionals who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by government entities, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities.  Our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers may be subject to the FCPA.
 Other countries, including a number of EU member states, have laws of similar application, including anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws such as the UK Bribery Act.  The UK Bribery Act prohibits giving, offering, or promising bribes to any person, as well as requesting, agreeing to receive, or accepting bribes from any person.  Under the UK Bribery Act, a company that carries on a business or part of a business in the United Kingdom may be held liable for bribes given, offered or promised to any person in any country by employees or other persons associated with the company in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company.  Liability under the UK Bribery Act is strict, but a defense of having in place adequate procedures designed to prevent bribery is available.
 Because of the breadth of these various fraud and abuse laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.  Such a challenge could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In the event governmental authorities conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations, they may impose sanctions under these laws, which are potentially significant and may include civil monetary penalties, damages, exclusion of an entity or individual from participation in government health care programs, criminal fines and imprisonment, as well as the potential curtailment or restructuring of our operations.  Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business.
 Government regulation outside of the United States 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted for each clinical trial to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, the corresponding clinical study may proceed. 
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, region-specific document requirements. The EMA has established the Adaptive Pathways pilot program intended to expedite or facilitate either an initial approval of a medicinal product in a well-defined patient subgroup with a high medical need and subsequent iterative expansion of the indication to a larger patient population, or an early regulatory approval (e.g., conditional approval), which is prospectively planned, and where uncertainty is reduced through the collection of post-approval data on a medicinal product’s use in patients. The approach builds in regulatory processes already in place within the existing EU legal framework.
 The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, innovative medicinal products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Products receiving orphan designation in the European Union can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no similar medicinal product for the same indication may be placed on the market. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. 
 39


The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if: 
  
• | The second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 In the EU, the advertising and promotion of our products will also be subject to EU member states’ laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, as well as other EU member state legislation that may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products.  These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s approved labeling. The off-label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU.  The applicable laws at the EU level and in the individual EU member states also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products.  Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment.  These laws may further limit or restrict communications concerning the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
 Failure to comply with the EU member state laws implementing the Community Code on medicinal products, and EU rules governing the promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, with the EU member state laws that apply to the promotion of medicinal products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the EU member state authorities, which may include any of the following: fines, imprisonment, orders forfeiting products or prohibiting or suspending their supply to the market, or requiring the manufacturer to issue public warnings, or to conduct a product recall.
 The national laws of certain EU member states require payments made to physicians to be publicly disclosed.  Moreover, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, or EFPIA, Code on disclosure of transfers of value from pharmaceutical companies to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations imposes a general obligation on members of the EFPIA or related national industry bodies to disclose transfers of value to healthcare professionals.  In addition, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU member states.  These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU member states.
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Central and South America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country.  This act could have implications for our interactions with physicians in and outside the UK.  In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP, applicable regulatory requirements, and ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, warning letters or untitled letters, injunctions, civil, administrative, or criminal penalties, monetary fines or imprisonment, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, suspension of ongoing clinical studies, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us, suspension or the imposition of restrictions on operations, product recalls, the refusal to permit the import or export of our products or the seizure or detention of products.

Pricing, Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors and/or governments. Third-party payors can include government healthcare systems, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payors may provide coverage, but place stringent limitations on such coverage, such as requiring alternative treatments to be tried first. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety, efficacy, and overall value. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to incurring the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically reasonable or necessary or cost-effective. Even if a drug product is covered, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 Federal, state and local governments in the United States and foreign governments continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.  On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of drug products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate systems under which products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of studies or analyses of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to set their own prices for medicines, but exert cost controls in other ways, including but not limited to, placing revenue caps on product sales, providing reimbursement for only a subset of eligible patients, mandating price negotiations after a set period of time, or mandating that prices not exceed an average basket of prices in other countries. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly treatments, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, European governments may periodically review and decrease prices based on factors, including but not limited to, yeas-on-market, price in other countries, competitive entry, new clinical data, lack of supporting clinical data, or other factors.
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, the emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to exert downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and pharmaceutical pricing regulations may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 We have proposed novel payment models, including outcomes-based arrangements with payments over time, to assist with realizing the value and sharing the risk of a potential one-time treatment, such as our LentiGlobin product candidate. While we are engaged in discussions with potential payors, there is no assurance that any payors will adopt these payment models. Even with these payment models, there may be substantial resistance to the cost of our products by payors and the public generally. These payment models may not be sufficient for payors to grant coverage, and if we are unable to obtain adequate coverage for our products, the adoption of our products and access for patients may be limited. In addition, to the extent reimbursement for our products is subject to outcomes-based arrangements, our future revenues from product sales will be more at risk. These factors could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
