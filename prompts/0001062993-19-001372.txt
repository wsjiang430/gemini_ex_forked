ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Corporate History 
 Our predecessor company, Big Flash Corp., was incorporated in Delaware on July 27, 1999. On April 28, 2006, Big Flash, through its Canadian holding corporation, completed the acquisition of IntelGenx Corp., a Canadian company incorporated on June 15, 2003. The Company did not have any operations prior to the acquisition of IntelGenx Corp. In connection with the acquisition, we changed our name from Big Flash Corp. to IntelGenx Technologies Corp. IntelGenx Corp. has continued operations as our operating subsidiary. 
Overview
 We are a drug delivery company established in 2003 and headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Our focus is on the development of novel oral immediate-release and controlled-release products for the pharmaceutical market. More recently, we have made the strategic decision to enter the oral film market and have implemented commercial oral film manufacturing capability. This enables us to offer our partners a comprehensive portfolio of pharmaceutical services, including pharmaceutical R&D, clinical monitoring, regulatory support, tech transfer and manufacturing scale-up, and commercial manufacturing.
 Our business strategy is to develop pharmaceutical products based on our proprietary drug delivery technologies and, once the viability of a product has been demonstrated, license the commercial rights to partners in the pharmaceutical industry. In certain cases, we rely upon partners in the pharmaceutical industry to fund the development of the licensed products, complete the regulatory approval process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other regulatory agencies relating to the licensed products, and assume responsibility for marketing and distributing such products. 
 In addition, we may choose to pursue the development of certain products until the project reaches the marketing and distribution stage. We will assess the potential for successful development of a product and associated costs, and then determine at which stage it is most prudent to seek a partner, balancing such costs against the potential for additional returns earned by partnering later in the development process. 
 Managing our project pipeline is a key success factor for the Company. We have undertaken a strategy under which we will work with pharmaceutical companies in order to apply our oral film technology to pharmaceutical products for which patent protection is nearing expiration, a strategy which is often referred to as lifecycle management. Under §505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, the FDA may grant market exclusivity for a term of up to three years following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage, dosage form, route of administration or combination.
 4 

The 505(b)(2) pathway is also the regulatory approach to be followed if an applicant intends to file an application for a product containing a drug that is already approved by the FDA for a certain indication and for which the applicant is seeking approval for a new indication or for a new use, the approval of which is required to be supported by new clinical trials, other than bioavailability studies. We have implemented a strategy under which we actively look for such so-called repurposing opportunities and determine whether our proprietary VersaFilm technology adds value to the product. We currently have two such drug repurposing projects in our development pipeline.
 We continue to develop the existing products in our pipeline and may also perform research and development on other potential products as opportunities arise.
 We have established a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility with the intent to manufacture all our VersaFilm products in-house as we believe that this: 
 
1. | represents a profitable business opportunity; 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | will reduce our dependency upon third-party contract manufacturers, thereby protecting our manufacturing process know- how and intellectual property; and 
3. | allows us to offer our clients and development partners a full service from product conception through to supply of the finished product. 

Technology Platforms
 Our product development efforts are based upon three delivery platform technologies: (1) VersaFilm, an Oral Film technology, (2) VersaTab, a Multilayer Tablet technology, and (3) AdVersa®, a Mucoadhesive Tablet technology.
 VersaFilm is a drug delivery platform technology that enables the development of oral thin films, improving product performance through: 
 
Rapid disintegration without the need for water;
 Quicker buccal or sublingual absorption;
 Potential for faster onset of action and increased bioavailability;
 Potential for reduced adverse effects by bypassing first-pass metabolism;
 Easy administration for patients who have problems swallowing tablets or
 capsules; pediatric and geriatric patients as well as patients who fear
 choking and/or are suffering from nausea (e.g., nausea resulting from
 chemotherapy, radiotherapy or any surgical treatment);
 Pleasant taste; and
 Small and thin size, making it convenient for consumers. 
 Our VersaFilm technology consists of a thin (25-35 micron) polymeric film comprised of United States Pharmacopeia components that are approved by the FDA for use in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic products. Derived from the edible film technology used for breath strips and initially developed for the instant delivery of savory flavors to food substrates, the VersaFilm technology is designed to provide a rapid response compared to existing conventional tablets. Our VersaFilm technology is intended for indications requiring rapid onset of action, such as migraine, opioid dependence, chronic pain, motion sickness, erectile dysfunction, and nausea. 
 Our VersaTab platform technology allows for the development of oral controlled-release products. It is designed to be versatile and to reduce manufacturing costs as compared to competing oral extended-release delivery technologies. Our VersaFilm technology allows for the instant delivery of pharmaceuticals to the oral cavity, while our AdVersa® allows for the controlled release of active substances to the oral mucosa. 
 Our VersaTab technology represents a new generation of controlled release layered tablets designed to modulate the release of active compounds. The technology is based on a multilayer tablet with an active core layer and erodible cover layers. The release of the active drug from the core matrix initially occurs in a first-order fashion. As the cover layers start to erode, their permeability for the active ingredient through the cover layers increases. Thus, the Multilayer Tablet can produce quasi-linear (zero-order) kinetics for releasing a chemical compound over a desired period of time. The erosion rate of the cover layers can be customized according to the physico-chemical properties of the active drug. In addition, our multilayer technology offers the opportunity to develop combination products in regulatory-compliant format. Combination products are made up of two or more active ingredients that are combined into a single dosage form. 
 5 

Our Mucoadhesive Tablet is a drug delivery system capable of adhering to the oral mucosa and releasing the drug to the site of application at a controlled rate. The Mucoadhesive Tablet is designed to provide the following advantages relative to competing technologies: (i) it avoids the first pass effect, whereby the liver metabolizes the active ingredient and greatly reduces the level of drug reaching the systemic circulation, (ii) it leads to a higher absorption rate in the oral cavity as compared to the conventional oral route, and (iii) it achieves a rapid onset of action for the drug. Our AdVersa® technology is designed to be versatile in order to permit the site of application, residence time, and rate of release of the drug to be modulated to achieve the desired results. 
 Product Portfolio
 Our product portfolio includes a blend of generic and branded products based on our proprietary delivery technology (generic products are essentially copies of products that have already received FDA approval). Of the thirteen projects currently in our product portfolio, ten utilize our VersaFilm technology, two utilize our VersaTab technology, and one utilizes our AdVersa® technology. Out of those thirteen projects, eight are actively progressing in research and development while the others have reached the regulatory or commercial stage.
 Our most active projects: 
 INT0008/2008: We developed this oral film product based on our VersaFilm technology. In March 2013 we submitted a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for our novel oral thin-film formulation of Rizatriptan, the active drug in Maxalt-MLT® orally disintegrating tablets. Maxalt-MLT® is a leading branded anti-migraine product marketed by Merck & Co. The thin-film formulation of Rizatriptan was developed in accordance with a co-development and commercialization agreement with RedHill Biopharma Ltd. (RedHill). In the second quarter of 2012 we conducted a pivotal clinical study against Maxalt-MLT® . The study results indicate that the product is safe, and that the 90% confidence intervals of the three relevant parameters Cmax, AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-infinity) are well within the 80  125 acceptance range for bioequivalency. 
 In June 2013 the FDA assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of February 3, 2014 for the review of the NDA for marketing approval and in February 2014 we received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA informing us that certain questions and deficiencies remain that preclude the approval of the application in its present form. The questions raised by the FDA in the CRL regarding the NDA for our anti-migraine VersaFilm product primarily relate to third party Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) and to the packaging and labeling of the product. No questions or deficiencies were raised relating to the products safety and the FDAs CRL does not require additional clinical studies.
 In March 2014 we submitted our response to the FDAs CRL and in April, 2014 the FDA requested additional CMC data. We also reported that the supplier of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of the product has been issued with an Import Alert by the FDA. The Import Alert bans the import into the USA of all raw materials from the suppliers manufacturing facility, which therefore prohibits the import of any products using these raw materials, and effectively prevents our VersaFilm product from being approved by the FDA. We identified a new source of API to manufacture new submission lots to support the re-submission of the NDA. 
 In October 2014 we submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) seeking European marketing approval of our oral thin film formulation of Rizatriptan for acute migraines, under the brand name RIZAPORT®. The brand name RIZAPORT® was also conditionally approved by the FDA as part of the NDA review process in the U.S. The MAA was submitted under the European Decentralized Procedure (DCP) with Germany as the reference member state.
 On September 10, 2015 we announced the positive outcome of the DCP confirming that RIZAPORT is approvable in Europe. The announcement followed the issuance of the Final Assessment Report from the Reference Member State, BfArM, and the agreement of all the Concerned Member States (CMS) in DCP that RIZAPORT® is approvable. With the decision, the regulatory process entered its final phase known as the national licensing phase during which the National Agencies in the individual countries will issue the marketing licenses that allow RIZAPORT® to be marketed in each country. 
 On November 9, 2015 we announced that BfArM has granted marketing authorization of RIZAPORT® 5mg and 10mg, an oral thin film formulation of rizatriptan benzoate for the treatment of acute migraines. The national approval of RIZAPORT® in Germany was granted under the DCP, in which Germany served as the Reference Member State. This authorization was the first national marketing approval of RIZAPORT®.
 On February 18, 2016, we announced that the USPTO had granted a patent protecting Rizaport®, an oral thin film formulation of rizatriptan benzoate for the treatment of acute migraines. This patent protects the composition of Rizaport® and will be listed in the Orange Book upon approval of the product by the FDA. The patent application, entitled "Instantly Wettable Oral Film Dosage Form Without Surfactant or Polyalcohol" covers rapidly disintegrating film oral dosage forms and is valid until 2034.

On July 5, 2016, we announced the signing of the definitive agreement with Grupo Juste S.A.Q.F. (now Exeltis Healthcare, S.L. (Exeltis)) for the commercialization of RIZAPORT®, our proprietary oral thin film for the treatment of acute migraines, in the country of Spain. All commercial manufacturing of RIZAPORT® will take place at our new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Canada. Grupo Juste (Exeltis) is a prominent private Spanish company with over 90 years of experience in the research, development and commercialization of proprietary pharmaceutical products, including migraine and other central nervous system drugs, in Europe, Latin America and other territories.
 According to the definitive agreement, Grupo Juste (Exeltis) has obtained exclusive rights to register, promote and distribute RIZAPORT® in Spain. In exchange, we and Redhill Biopharma received upfront payments and are entitled to milestone payments, together with a share of the net sales of RIZAPORT®. The initial term of the definitive agreement shall be for ten years from the date of first commercial sale of the product and shall automatically renew for one additional two-year term.
 Through our partner Grupo Juste (Exeltis), the product was submitted in Spain in September 2016 for approval using a decentralized procedure.
 On December 14, 2016, we, together with our partner RedHill, announced the signing of an exclusive license agreement with Pharmatronic Co. for the commercialization of RIZAPORT® in the Republic of Korea (South Korea). Under the terms of the agreement, RedHill granted Pharmatronic Co. the exclusive rights to register and commercialize RIZAPORT® in South Korea. IntelGenx and RedHill have received an upfront payment and will be eligible to receive additional milestone payments upon achievement of certain predefined regulatory and commercial targets, as well as tiered royalties. The initial term of the definitive agreement with Pharmatronic Co. is for ten years from the date of first commercial sale and shall automatically renew for an additional two-year term.
 In April 2017, we announced the national marketing approval in Luxembourg which completes the approval process of RIZAPORT® under the DCP. 
 On October 31, 2017, we re-submitted the 505(b)(2)NDA in response to the CRL received in February, 2014 and the request from FDA for additional information received in April, 2014. The review of the submission by the FDA triggered an incomplete response letter. On December 1, 2017, the FDA notified the Company that additional data would be required before commencing the review of the application. 
 On December 5, 2017 we announced the termination of the Co-development and Commercialization agreement with Redhill, following which Redhill transferred all rights and obligations under the agreement to the Company. 
 On September 24, 2018 IntelGenx announced the successful completion of a clinical study comparing Rizaport®, oral soluble film, and Maxalt®, an orally disintegrating tablet. Following the study, on November 20, 2018, the FDA accepted the re-submitted 505(b) (2) NDA for review. 
 On October 31, 2018 IntelGenx announced that its commercialization partner for RIZAPORT® (10mg) in Spain, Grupo Juste, which is now part of Exeltis Healthcare, received national marketing authorization from the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices for the product.Following the approval of the manufacturing site transfer of RIZAPORT® from the European contract manufacturer listed in the initial manufacturing site transfer application to IntelGenxs GMP compliant facility in Montreal, Canada, IntelGenxs marketing partner, Exeltis Healthcare, will be able to commercialize the product in Spain. The Company believes that recently reported results from a successful study, demonstrating that RIZAPORT® is bioequivalent to the European reference, Maxalt®-Lingua, will further support the site transfer application in Spain. Approval of the manufacturing site change by the Spanish authorities is currently expected for the second half of 2019.
 On December 12, 2018 we announced the execution of a definitive licensing, development and supply agreement with Gensco® Pharma, a specialty pharmaceutical company focusing on research, development and marketing of prescription products, for the exclusive commercialization of RIZAPORT® in the United States. Under the Agreement, Gensco® Pharma has been granted the exclusive right to commercialize RIZAPORT® in the United States. In return, IntelGenx is entitled to receive royalty payments based on the net profits of RIZAPORT®. IntelGenx is also eligible to receive milestone payments upon FDA approval and product launch. The agreement also grants Gensco® Pharma exclusivity to develop, market, sell, distribute and fully commercialize products as an IntelGenx partner for the Peoples Republic of China. 
 On January 30, 2019, we announced that the FDA had performed a Pre-Approval Inspection (PAI) of the companys Health Canada-certified cGMP manufacturing facility in Montreal, relating to our NDA for RIZAPORT®, a VersaFilm oral soluble film for the treatment of acute migraines. At the conclusion of the PAI on January 25, the FDA issued a Form 483 with five inspectional observations. The FDA has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date of April 1, 2019, for completion of the review of the resubmitted NDA for RIZAPORT®. We do not expect the inspectional observations to impact the timeline for the FDAs decision on the approval of RIZAPORT®.

INT0027/2011: We developed this oral film product based on our VersaFilm technology. In accordance with a co-development and commercialization agreement with Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. (Par) (now an operating company of Endo International plc), we developed an oral film product based on our proprietary VersaFilm technology. The product is a generic formulation of buprenorphine and naloxone Sublingual Film, indicated for the treatment of opioid dependence. A bioequivalent film formulation was developed, scaled-up, and pivotal batches were manufactured and tested during a subsequent pivotal clinical study. An ANDA was filed with the FDA by Par in July 2013.
 In August 2013 we were notified that, in response to the filing of the ANDA, we were named as a codefendant in a lawsuit pursuant to Paragraph IV of the Hatch Waxman act filed by Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals and Monosol RX in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (the Delaware Court) alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,475,832, 8,603,514 and 8,017,150, each of which relate to Suboxone®. We believe the ANDA product does not infringe those or any other patents. In accordance with the terms of the co-development and commercialization agreement, Par was financially responsible for the costs of the defense. Paragraph IV litigation is a regular part of the ANDA process and did not have any impact on our development schedule. In June 2016, an opinion from the district court was obtained on the validity and infringement of the 3 orange book patents. The court ruled that the product is not infringing on two out of the three patents. Subsequently, appeals were filed by both parties.
 In December 2014, Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals and Monosol RX filed a lawsuit for patent infringement in the Delaware Court relating to the Suboxone® ANDA product. We were named as a codefendant in this action alleging patent infringement United States Patent Nos. 8,900,497 (the 497 patent) and 8,906,277 (the 277 patent), each of which related to a process for making a uniform oral film (the process patents). The trial for the process patents was held in November 2016. 
 On July 11, 2016, the Company announced the receipt of the notice of appeal for the buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film product for the treatment of opiate addiction by Par and the Company to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit from the final judgment issued by the Delaware Court on June 28, 2016. 
 The ruling in the U.S. District Court of Delaware in the ANDA litigation of Par and the Company against Indivior PLC (formerly Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals) and Monosol Rx, LLC resulted in Par and the Company prevailing on the non-infringement of the U.S. Patent No. 8,017,150, which is set to expire in 2023, and on the invalidity (all claims) and non-infringement (certain claims) of the U.S. Patent No. 8,475,832, which is set to expire in 2030. The Court also ruled that Pars ANDA product would infringe the asserted claims of U.S. Patent No. 8,603,514, one of the Orange Book listed patents for Suboxone® Film, and that the asserted claims of U.S. Patent No. 8,603,514 were not shown to be invalid. 
 On September 6, 2017, we announced that the Delaware Court, in a decision rendered August 31, 2017, determined that the process used to manufacture IntelGenx and Pars buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film product for the treatment of opiate addiction does not infringe MonoSol Rx LLC (now Aquestive Therapeutics Inc.) 497 patent and that on August 31, 2017, the Delaware Court rendered a decision in a separate case, which previously resulted in a finding infringement of the MonoSol Rx LLC (now known as Aquestive Therapeutics Inc.) the 514 patent, denying IntelGenx and Pars motion to reopen the case. The Delaware Court decisions were under appeal before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal CircuitThere were several lawsuits for patent infringement in U.S. District Courts related to the Suboxone® ANDA product. These new ANDA lawsuits were based on patents submitted on the FDA Orange Book in 2017 and 2018. IntelGenx was not a party to any of these U.S. District Court instances related to the Suboxone® ANDA product.
 On May 14, 2018, we announced that all patent litigation between the Company, Par Pharmaceutical, Inc.`, Indivior, Inc., Indivior UK Limited, and Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly MonoSol Rx, LLC) related to Suboxone® film had been settled. The settlement agreement permits Par to begin selling a generic version of Suboxone® film on January 1, 2023 or earlier under certain circumstances.
 INT0010/2006: This product is based on our proprietary AdVersa® technology and is currently in an advanced development stage. We initially entered into an agreement with Cynapsus Therapeutics Inc. (formerly Cannasat Therapeutics Inc., Cynapsus) for the development of a buccal muco-adhesive tablet product containing a cannabinoid-based drug for the treatment of neuropathic pain and nausea in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. In 2009, we completed a clinical biostudy on the muco-adhesive tablet we developed which is based on our proprietary AdVersa® technology. The study results indicated improved bioavailability and reduced first-pass metabolization of the drug. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we acquired from Cynapsus full control of, and interest in, this project going forward. We also obtained worldwide rights to U.S. Patent 7,592,328 and all corresponding foreign patents and patent applications to exclusively develop and further secure intellectual property protection for this project. 
 8 

On April 5, 2017, we announced signing of a Definitive Agreement for the development and commercialization of a drug product containing the cannabinoid Dronabinol (the Product) for the management of anorexia and cancer chemotherapy-related pain. This definitive agreement followed the binding term sheet between the two companies that was announced on February 9, 2017. 
 Pursuant to the definitive agreement, Tetra has exclusive rights to sell the Product in North America, with a right of first negotiation for territories outside of the United States and Canada. Tetra made an upfront payment to IntelGenx, in addition to set future milestone and royalty payments, based on the completion of an efficacy study, approvals from the FDA and Health Canada, and the commercial launch of the Product. We are responsible for the research and development of the product, including optimization of the prototype, scale-up activities and preparation of a phase II proof of concept clinical study and are developing the product as an oral mucoadhesive tablet based on our proprietary AdVersa® controlled-release technology. Tetra is responsible for funding the product development, and will own and control all regulatory approvals, including the related applications, and any other marketing authorizations. Tetra will also be responsible for all aspects of commercializing the Product. 
 INT0036/2013: This oral film product is based on our proprietary oral film technology VersaFilm and is currently in the optimization development stage. Loxapine is indicated for the treatment of anxiety and aggression in patients suffering from schizophrenia or bipolar 1 disorder. Loxapine oral film will utilize the companys proprietary VersaFilm technology, allowing for an improved product to offer patients significant therapeutic benefits compared to existing medications. A fast acting Loxapine oral film dosage form that can be used to effectively treat acute agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar 1 disorder in non-institutionalized patients while reducing the risk of pulmonary problems is needed as it could substantially reduce the potential risks of violence and injury to patients and others by preventing or reducing the duration and severity of an episode of acute agitation. Our first clinical study on this product, completed in Q4 2014, suggested improved bioavailability compared to the currently approved tablet. In late 2015 we completed a second pilot clinical study which demonstrated that buccal absorption of the drug from the Loxapine oral film results in a significantly higher bioavailability of the drug compared to oral tablets. We are working to optimize the film to further improve the time to reach peak plasma concentrations. However, due to the prioritisation of our project line, resources were directed to other projects, which resulted in a temporary hold of the optimization work during the last year. We are now actively working on advancing this project.
 On February 10, 2016, we announced the submission of the patent application with the U.S. patent office for an oral film dosage form containing Loxapine for the treatment of anxiety and aggression in patients suffering from schizophrenia or bipolar 1 disorder. The application is currently under review.
 INT0040/2014: An oral film product based on our proprietary VersaFilmtechnology is currently in the scale up stage. In order to protect our competitive advantage, no further details of the product can be disclosed at this stage. 
 On December 27, 2016, we announced that we have entered into a co-development and commercialization agreement with Endo Ventures Ltd. for this product utilizing our proprietary VersaFilm for the U.S. market. Under the agreement, Endo has obtained certain exclusive rights to market and sell our product in the U.S. We received an upfront payment and will receive future milestone payments. Endo and IntelGenx will share the profits of commercialization. 
 INT0043/2015: We have developed an oral film containing montelukast as an active ingredient based on our proprietary edible film technology VersaFilm, which is in the early clinical trial phase. In pre-clinical studies, it was discovered that montelukast has the potential to rejuvenate the brain in aged rats. 
 We are collaborating with Dr. Ludwig Aigner, a neuroscientist who is a member of our Scientific Advisory Board and head of the Institute of Molecular Regenerative Medicine at the Paracelsus Medical University in Salzburg, Austria. Dr. Aigner has made major contributions in the field of brain and spinal cord regeneration over the last 25 years. He was the first to develop tools to visualize neurogenesis in living animals and identified signaling mechanisms that are crucially involved in limiting brain regeneration. One of these mechanisms, leukotriene signaling, is related to asthma. In consequence, Dr. Aigner and his team recently demonstrated that the anti-asthmatic drug montelukast structurally and functionally rejuvenates the aged brain. His main aim is to develop molecular and cellular therapies for patients with neurodegenerative diseases and for the aged population.
 On July 13, 2016, we announced the successful completion of the pilot clinical study for our Montelukast VersaFilm that demonstrated a significantly improved pharmacokinetic profile against the reference product. The study data confirmed that buccal absorption of the drug from the Montelukast film product resulted in a significantly improved bioavailability of the drug compared to the commercial tablet. In addition, the study data confirmed that Montelukast crosses the blood brain barrier when administered using our Versafilm delivery technology. 
 In 2017 we announced receiving the no objection letter from Health Canada regarding a phase II-a proof-of-concept study. The objectives of this 26 week, randomized, double-blind, and placebo controlled Phase IIa proof of concept study which will be conducted at eight clinical study sites across Canada will be to evaluate the safety, feasibility, tolerability, and efficacy of Montelukast buccal film in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimers disease. The trial design includes testing of up to 70 patients. 
 9 

On January 24, 2018 we announced that we retained the services of Cogstate and JSS Medical Research as the Contract Research Organizations to support the Montelukast VersaFilmTM study 
 We are also actively working on securing the IP of our product by filing numerous patent applications. Based on the outcome of this first efficacy trial in humans, we will be actively seeking a partnership or alliance opportunity to further advance developmental work and commercialization of this product. 
 On September 25, 2018, we announced that patient recruitment will commence for the Phase 2a study with Montelukast VersaFilm in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimers Disease (AD). Two research sites (the Centre for Memory and Aging in Toronto, ON and True North Clinical Research in Halifax, NS) are being activated and will be open for patient enrollment as of September 26, 2018, with additional sites planning to initiate patient screening in the near future. This randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 2a proof of concept study will enroll approximately 70 subjects with mild to moderate AD across eight Canadian research sites. The primary study objectives will be to evaluate the safety, feasibility, tolerability, and efficacy of Montelukast buccal film following daily dosing for 26 week 
 INT0046/2018: Our first Cannabis project based on our VersaFilm technology is currently in the early development stage. We started this project in anticipation of the amended cannabis regulations that would allow adult-use consumers to purchase edible products in Canada. 
 On November 7, 2018 we announced the execution of a definitive license, development and supply agreement with Tilray, Inc., a global leader in cannabis production and distribution. Pursuant to the agreement, the two companies will co-develop and commercialize oral film products infused with adult-use and medical cannabis (cannabis-infused VersaFilm),
 Under the agreement with Tilray, Inc., IntelGenx and Tilray, Inc. will fund 20% and 80%, respectively, of the costs associated with the development of the cannabis-infused Versafilm products. IntelGenx will have the exclusive right to manufacture and supply the co-developed products to Tilray, Inc., and will also receive a fixed single-digit royalty on net product sales. Tilray, Inc., will have the exclusive, worldwide marketing and distribution rights for the co-developed products. 
 In connection with the agreement with Tilray, Inc , the parties have also executed a subscription agreement pursuant to which Tilray, Inc. made a strategic investment in IntelGenx by way of a non-brokered private placement (Private Placement). Pursuant to the Private Placement, the IntelGenx issued 1,428,571 common shares at a subscription price of U.S.$0.70 per common share for gross proceeds of U.S.$1,000,000. We intend to use the proceeds of the Private Placement for cannabis-infused VersaFilm product development under the agreement with Tilray, Inc. 
 INT0045/2018: A oral film product based on our proprietary VersaFilmtechnology. This is a new project we started in 2018 which is currently in the early development stage. In order to protect our competitive advantage, no further details of the product can be disclosed at this stage. 
 Regulatory Stage Projects: 
 INT0007/2006: We are developing an oral film product based on our VersaFilm technology containing the active ingredient Tadalafil. The product is intended for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). The results of a phase I pilot study that was conducted in the second quarter of 2015 confirmed that the product is bioequivalent with the brand product, Cialis®. We are currently compiling data and reviewing the worldwide regulatory requirements. 
 On November 21, 2016, we announced the signing of a binding term sheet for a license to Eli Lilly and Companys tadalafil dosing patent, United States Patent No. 6,943,166 (the 166 dosing patent). Any exclusivity associated with the tadalafil compound patent is not affected by this agreement.
 Subject to FDA approval, this license allows us to commercialize a Tadalafil ED VersaFilm product in the U.S. prior to the expiration of the 166 dosing patent. This license terminates all our current tadalafil-related litigation activities.
 On March 28, 2017, we announced that Eli Lilly and Company granted IntelGenx an exclusive license for tadalafil film product under ED dosing patent, the 166 dosing patent.
 10 

We are in discussions with potential partners for the commercialization of our Tadalafil ED VersaFilm product.
 INT0039/2013: The product based on one of our proprietary technologies was being developed under another development and commercialization agreement with Par. On September 18, 2015, Par was acquired by Endo International plc. As a result of this acquisition, there was a conflict for Par to remain as the partner for this product. Therefore, the product was returned to the Company with full rights and no requirement for any compensation for work paid by Par.
 On September 12, 2016, we announced that we had entered into a licensing, development and supply agreement with Chemo granting Chemo the exclusive license to commercialize two generic products for the U.S. market and one product on a worldwide basis. Under the terms of the agreement, Chemo has obtained certain exclusive rights to market and sell our products in exchange for upfront and milestone payments, together with a share of the profits of commercialization. Chemo also has a right of first negotiation to obtain the exclusive commercialization rights for two of the products to include any country outside the U.S.
 On October 4, 2018 IntelGenx announced that an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for a generic buccal film product has been submitted to the FDA by its partner, Insud Pharma (formerly Chemo Group). On January 30, 2019 the FDA confirmed the acceptance for review of this ANDA with a GDUFA date of October 18, 2019. IntelGenx is currently preparing for the upcoming pre approval inspection. 
 INT0037/2013: A product based on one of our proprietary technologies has been developed but preparations of submission batches and documentation in support of a marketing application to the FDA have been placed on hold. 
 The product was being developed in accordance with another development and commercialization agreement with Par. On September 18, 2015, Par was acquired by Endo International plc. As a result of this acquisition, there was a conflict for Par to remain as the partner for these products. As such, the product was returned to the Company with full rights and no requirement for any compensation for work paid by Par.
 On September 12, 2016, we announced that we had entered into a licensing, development and supply agreement with Chemo Group (Chemo) granting Chemo the exclusive license to commercialize two generic products for the USA market and one product on a worldwide basis. Under the terms of the agreement, Chemo has obtained certain exclusive rights to market and sell our products in exchange for upfront and milestone payments, together with a share of the profits of commercialization. Chemo also has a right of first negotiation to obtain the exclusive commercialization rights for two of the products to include any country outside the USA. As per our partner decision, activities in preparation for filing the marketing application for this product have been placed on hold.
 Other projects: 
 INT0001/2004: This is the most advanced tablet generic product involving our multilayer tablet technology. Equivalency with the reference product Toprol XL® and its European equivalent Beloc-ZOK® has been demonstrated in-vitro. The product has been tested in phase I studies. In November 2016 we entered into a License and Development Agreement with Chemo Group to advance the commercialization of our Versa Tab product. The manufacturing technology transfer to Chemo is still ongoing.
 INT0004/2006: We developed a new, higher strength of the antidepressant Bupropion HCl, the active ingredient in Wellbutrin XL®, and, in November 2011, the FDA approved the drug for patients with Major Depressive Disorder. In February 2012, we entered into an agreement with Edgemont Pharmaceuticals LLC (Edgemont) for commercialization of the product in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, Edgemont obtained certain exclusive rights to market and sell the product in the U.S. In exchange we received a $1 million upfront payment, received launch related milestones totaling up to $4 million, were eligible for additional milestones of up to a further $23.5 million upon achieving certain sales and exclusivity targets and to also receive tiered double-digit royalties on the net sales of the product.
 The product was launched in the U.S. in October 2012 under the brand name Forfivo XL®. As of December 31, 2015 we had received an upfront payment of $1 million and a $1 million milestone payment related to the launch. The commercialization of Forfivo XL® triggered a launch-related milestone payment of $3 million from IntelGenx licensing partner Edgemont due to Edgemont reaching in July 2015, $7 million of cumulative net trade sales of Forfivo XL® over the preceding 12 months.
 In August 2013, we announced receipt of a Paragraph IV Certification Letter from Wockhardt Bio AG, advising of the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) to the FDA requesting authorization to manufacture and market generic versions of Forfivo XL® 450 mg tablets in the U.S. In November 2014 we announced that the Paragraph IV litigation with Wockhardt had been settled and that, under the terms of the settlement, Wockhardt has been granted the right, with effect from January 15, 2018, to be the exclusive marketer and distributor of an authorized generic of Forfivo XL® in the U.S. 
 11 

In December 2014 we announced that Edgemont had exercised its right to extend the license for the exclusive marketing of Forfivo XL® 450 mg tablets. In exchange, we received milestone payments of $650 thousand in December 2014 and $600 thousand in February 2015. All other financial obligations contained in the license agreement entered into by Edgemont and IntelGenx in February 2012, specifically launch-related and sales milestones, together with the contractual royalty rates on net sales of the product, remained in effect. 
 On August 5, 2016, we announced that we had sold our U.S. royalty on future sales of Forfivo XL® to SWK Holdings Corporation (SWK) for $6 million (CA$8 million). Forfivo XL® (Bupropion extended-release) is the first 450 mg bupropion HCl tablet indicated for Major Depressive Disorder, approved by the FDA. As per terms of the agreement, we received $6 million from SKW at closing. In return for, (i) 100% of any and all royalties (as defined in the Edgemont Pharmaceuticals, LLC License Agreement) or similar royalty amounts received on or after April 1, 2016, (ii) 100% of the $2 million milestone payment upon Edgemont reaching annual net sales of $15 million, and (iii) 35% of all potential future milestone payments. Patent protection for Forfivo XL® in the United States expires in 2027.
 In the first quarter of 2017, IntelGenx was informed that Edgemont Pharmaceuticals, LLC. assigned its product business, including Forfivo XL®, to Alvogen Group Holdings 3 LLC.
 IntelGenx retained all patent rights to the product Forfivo XL®, which is sold on the US market. 
 INT0044/2016: A product based on one of our VersaTabTM proprietary technologies.
 On December 1st, 2016, we announced the signing of a term sheet for the co-development and commercialization of a generic tablet in the area of central nervous systems on a worldwide basis. As per the agreement, we received an upfront payment and would have been entitled to receive development costs of the product and future milestone payments. Chemo and IntelGenx would have also shared the profits of commercialization. The definitive agreement was signed on December 30, 2016. However, on May 23, 2018, Chemo and IntelGenx mutually agreed to terminate the agreement and Chemo assigned all rights, titles and interests in and to any product-related intellectual property and related data and regulatory dossiers to IntelGenx.

Growth Strategy
 Our primary growth strategies are based on three pillars: (1) out licensing commercial rights of our existing pipeline products, (2) partnering on contract development and manufacturing projects leveraging our VersaFilm technology, (3) expanding our current pipeline through: 

identifying lifecycle management opportunities for existing market leading
 pharmaceutical products,
 developing oral film products that provide tangible patient benefits,
 development of new drug delivery technologies,
 repurposing existing drugs for new indications, and
 developing generic drugs where high technology barriers to entry exist in
 reproducing branded films. 
 Contract Development and Manufacturing based on VersaFilm technology 
 We have established a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for the future manufacture of our VersaFilm products. We believe that this (1) represents a profitable business opportunity, (2) will reduce our dependency upon third-party contract manufacturers, thereby protecting our manufacturing process know-how and intellectual property, and (3) allows us to offer our development partners a full service from product conception through to supply of the finished product.
 With our current manufacturing equipment, we are only able to manufacture products that do not contain flammable organic solvents. We initiated a project to expand the existing manufacturing facility, the timing of which will be dictated in part by the completion of agreements with our commercial partners. This expansion became necessary following requests by commercial partners to increase manufacturing capacity and provide solvent film manufacturing capabilities. The new facility should create a fivefold increase of our production capacity in addition to offering a one-stop shopping opportunity to our partners and provide better protection of our Intellectual Property.
Lifecycle Management Opportunities 
 We are seeking to position our delivery technologies as an opportunity for lifecycle management of products for which patent protection of the active ingredient is nearing expiration. While the patent for the underlying substance cannot be extended, patent protection can be obtained for a new and improved formulation by filing an application with the FDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Such applications, known as a 505(b)(2) NDA, are permitted for new drug products that incorporate previously approved active ingredients, even if the proposed new drug incorporates an approved active ingredient in a novel formulation or for a new indication. A 505(b)(2) NDA may include information regarding safety and efficacy of a proposed drug that comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant. The first formulation for a respective active ingredient filed with the FDA under a 505(b)(2) application may qualify for up to three years of market exclusivity upon approval. Based upon a review of past partnerships between third party drug delivery companies and pharmaceutical companies, management believes that drug delivery companies which possess innovative technologies to develop these special dosage formulations present an attractive opportunity to pharmaceutical companies. Accordingly, we believe 505(b)(2) products represent a viable business opportunity for us. 
Product Opportunities that provide Tangible Patient Benefits 
 Our focus will be on developing oral film products leveraging our VersaFilm technology that provide tangible patient benefits versus existing drug delivery forms. Patients with difficulties swallowing medication, pediatrics or geriatrics may benefit from oral films due to the ease of use. Similarly, we are working on oral films to improve bio-availability and/or response time versus existing drugs and thereby reducing side effects. 
 13 

Development of New Drug Delivery Technologies 
 The rapidly disintegrating film technology contained in our VersaFilm, and our AdVersa® mucosal adhesive tablet, are two examples of our efforts to develop alternate technology platforms. As we work with various partners on different products, we seek opportunities to develop new proprietary technologies.
Repurposing Existing Drugs 
 We are working on the repurposing of already approved drugs for new indications using our VersaFilm film technology. This program represents a viable growth strategy for us as it will allow for reduced development costs, improved success rates and shorter approval times. We believe that through our repurposing program we will be able minimize the risk of developmental failure and create value for us and potential partners. 
Generic Drugs with High Barriers to Entry 
 We plan to pursue the development of generic drugs that have certain barriers to entry, e.g., where product development and manufacturing is complex and can limit the number of potential entrants into the generic market. We plan to pursue such projects only if the number of potential competitors is deemed relatively insignificant.
Competition 
 The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and is subject to the rapid emergence of new technologies, governmental regulations, healthcare legislation, availability of financing, patent litigation and other factors. Many of our competitors, including Aquestive Therapeutics Inc. (formerly Monosol Rx), Tesa-Labtec GmbH, BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. and LTS Lohmann Therapy Systems Corp., have longer operating histories and greater financial, technical, marketing, legal and other resources than we have. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in conducting clinical trials of pharmaceutical products, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products, and marketing and selling products that have been approved. We expect that we will be subject to competition from numerous other companies that currently operate or are planning to enter the markets in which we compete.
 The key factors affecting the development and commercialization of our drug delivery products are likely to include, among other factors:
 

The regulatory requirements; 

The safety and efficacy of our products; 

The relative speed with which we can develop products; 

Generic competition for any product that we develop; 

Our ability to defend our existing intellectual property and to broaden our
 intellectual property and technology base; 

Our ability to differentiate our products; 

Our ability to develop products that can be manufactured on a cost
 effective basis; 

Our ability to manufacture our products in compliance with current Good
 Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and any other regulatory requirements; and
 

Our ability to obtain financing. 
 In order to establish ourselves as a viable industry partner, we plan to continue to invest in our research and development activities and in our manufacturing technology expertise, in order to further strengthen our technology base and to develop the ability to manufacture our VersaFilm products ourselves, and our VersaTab and AdVersa® products through our manufacturing partners, at competitive costs.
 14 

Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe that our key competitive strengths include:
 

Our comprehensive full services; 

Our diversified pipeline; 

Our ability to swiftly develop products through to regulatory approval; and
 

The versatility of our drug delivery technologies. 

Our highly qualified, dedicated professional team 
Manufacturing Partnership 
 While we previously manufactured products only for testing purposes in our own laboratories, we have now started to manufacture products for pivotal clinical trials, and we are undertaking steps to manufacture products for commercial use. In order to establish ourselves as a full-service partner for our thin film products, we have completed the construction of a new, state-of-the-art oral film manufacturing facility and are in the process of preparing the equipment and finalizing plans to commercially manufacture our products using our VersaFilm drug delivery technology. VersaFilm is our proprietary immediate release polymeric film technology. It is comprised of a thin polymeric film using United States Pharmacopeia components that are safe and approved by the FDA for use in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. We completed construction of our manufacturing facility in 2017 and successfully passed a quality audit by Health Canada in November, 2017 following which we received our Drug Establishment License. Since then, we are fully operational.
Dependence on Major Customers 
 We currently rely on a few major customers for our end products. We also currently depend upon a limited number of partners to develop our products, to provide funding for the development of our products, to assist in obtaining regulatory approvals that are required in order to commercialize these products, and to market and sell our products. 
Intellectual Property and Patent Protection
 We protect our intellectual property and technology by using the following methods: (i) applying for patent protection in the United States and in the appropriate foreign markets, (ii) non-disclosure agreements, license agreements and appropriate contractual restrictions and controls on the distribution of information, and (iii) trade secrets, common law trademark rights and trademark registrations. We plan to file core technology patents covering the use of our platform technologies in any pharmaceutical products. 
 We have obtained 14 patents and have an additional 40 published pending patent applications, as described below. The patents expire 20 years after submission of the initial application. In the U.S. the term of the patent sometimes extends over the 20-year period. The initial term of 20 years is extended by a period (the patent term adjustment) determined by the USPTO according to delays in the prosecution of the patent application that are not applicant delays.

Government Regulation
 The pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated. The products we participate in developing require certain regulatory approvals. In the United States, drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA. The U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, record keeping, packaging, labeling, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing, distribution, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicially-imposed sanctions and/or the inability to obtain or maintain required approvals or to market drugs. The steps ordinarily required before a new pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States include: 


Preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies under
 FDAs good laboratory practices regulations, or GLPs; 

The submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, which
 must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

The completion of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials according to
 good clinical practice regulations, or GCPs, to establish the safety and
 efficacy of the product for each indication for which approval is sought; 

After successful completion of the required clinical testing, submission to
 the FDA of a NDA, or an ANDA, for generic drugs. In certain cases, an
 application for marketing approval may include information regarding safety
 and efficacy of a proposed drug that comes from studies not conducted by or
 for the applicant. Such applications, known as a 505(b)(2) NDA, are permitted
 for new drug products that incorporate previously approved active ingredients,
 even if the proposed new drug incorporates an approved active ingredient in a
 novel formulation or for a new indication; 

Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the
 manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is to be produced,
 to assess compliance with cGMPs to assure that the facilities, methods and
 controls are adequate to preserve the drugs identity, strength, quality and
 purity; and 

FDA review and approval of the NDA or ANDA. 
 The cost of complying with the foregoing requirements, including preparing and submitting an NDA or ANDA, may be substantial. Accordingly, we typically rely upon our partners in the pharmaceutical industry to spearhead and bear the costs of the FDA approval process. We also seek to mitigate regulatory costs by focusing on 505(b)(2) NDA opportunities. By applying our drug delivery technology to existing drugs, we seek to develop products with lower research & development (R&D) expenses and shorter time-to-market timelines as compared to regular NDA products.
 Cannabis in Canada 
 The signing of the Cannabis Act created a strict legal framework for controlling the production, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis across Canada. Cannabis edible products and concentrates will be legal for sale approximately one year after the Cannabis Act came into force on October 17th, 2018. 
 Our R&D expenses, net of R&D tax credits, for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $2,489 thousand to $5,104 thousand, compared with $2,615 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in R&D expenditure is explained in the section of this report entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Environmental Regulatory Compliance 
 We believe that we are in compliance with environmental regulations applicable to our research and development and manufacturing facility located in Ville Saint Laurent, Quebec.
