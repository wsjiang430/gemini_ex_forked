 Automotive - We manufacture a full line of railcar equipment specifically designed for the transportation of light vehicles. Our automotive offerings include the Auto-Max II and Multi-Max products, which are designed to carry automobiles, SUVs and trucks efficiently.
 On July 26, 2019 we completed our acquisition of the manufacturing business of American Rail Industries, Inc. (American Railcar Industries or ARI). In connection with the acquisition, we acquired two railcar manufacturing facilities in Arkansas that primarily produce two types of railcars, covered hoppers and tank cars, but have the ability to produce additional railcar types. As part of the acquisition we also acquired other facilities which produce a range of railcar components and parts and create enhanced vertical integration for our manufacturing operations. These railcar components and parts include outlets for hopper railcars, tank car components and valves, tank heads, manway covers, wheel pair sets, underframes and running boards. Employees at these facilities as well as manufacturing and administrative employees in Missouri became Greenbrier employees upon closing of the acquisition. 
 European Railcar Manufacturing - Our European manufacturing operations produce a variety of tank, automotive and conventional freight railcar types, including a comprehensive line of pressurized tank cars for liquid petroleum gas, chlorine and ammonia and non-pressurized tank cars for light oil, chemicals and other products. In addition, we produce flat cars, coil cars for steel and metals, gondolas, sliding wall cars and automobile transport cars. 
 Marine Vessel Fabrication - We manufacture a broad range of Jones Act ocean-going and river barges for transporting merchandise between ports within the U.S. including conventional deck barges, double-hull tank barges, railcar/deck barges, barges for aggregates and other heavy industrial products and dump barges. Our primary focus is on the larger ocean-going vessels although we have the capability to compete in other marine-related products. Our Portland, Oregon manufacturing facility, located on a deep-water port on the Willamette River, includes marine vessel fabrication capabilities. The marine facilities increase utilization of steel plate burning and fabrication capacity providing flexibility for railcar production. 
Wheels, Repair & Parts Segment 
 Wheel Services - We operate a large wheel services network in North America. Our wheel shops, provide complete wheel services including reconditioning of wheels and axles in addition to new axle machining, finishing and downsizing. Through a joint venture partnership we also provide axle machining, finishing and downsizing. 
 Railcar Repair, Refurbishment and Maintenance - We operate a railcar repair, refurbishment and maintenance network in North America including repair shops certified by the Association of American Railroads (AAR). Our repair shops perform heavy railcar repair, refurbishment and routine railcar maintenance for third parties and for our leased and managed railcar fleet. 
 Component Parts Manufacturing - Our component parts facilities recondition and manufacture railcar cushioning units, couplers, yokes, side frames, bolsters and various other parts. We also produce roofs, doors and associated parts for boxcars. 
Leasing & Services Segment 
 Leasing - We operate a railcar leasing business in North America. Our relationships with financial institutions combined with our ownership of a lease fleet of approximately 9,400 railcars enables us to offer flexible financing programs to our customers including operating leases of varied intervals and by the mile leases. In addition to leasing our own railcars, we originate leases of railcars, which are either newly built or refurbished by us, or bought in the secondary market, and sell the railcars and attached leases to financial institutions typically with multi-year management services agreements. As an equipment owner and an originator of leases, we participate principally in the operating lease segment of the market. Under the majority of our leases, we are responsible for maintenance and administration of the leased cars. Assets from our owned lease fleet are periodically sold to take advantage of market conditions, manage risk and maintain liquidity.

4 | The Greenbrier Companies 2019 Annual Report



 Our total manufacturing backlog of railcar units was approximately 30,300 units with an estimated value of $3.28 billion as of August 31, 2019 and 27,400 units with an estimated value of $2.74 billion as of August 31, 2018. Approximately 3% of backlog units and 2% of estimated backlog value as of August 31, 2019 and 2018 was associated with our Brazilian manufacturing operations which are accounted for under the equity method. Backlog as of August 31, 2019 reflects the transfer of 10,600 units from ARI and the removal of 3,500 small cube covered hoppers for sand service for which we realized negotiated economic benefits. Remaining backlog does not include any other orders for the sand market. 
 Based on current production schedules, approximately 20,000 units in the August 31, 2019 backlog are scheduled for delivery in 2020. The balance of the production is scheduled for delivery in 2021 and beyond. Multi-year supply agreements are common in the rail industry. Backlog units for lease may be syndicated to third parties or held in our own fleet depending on a variety of factors. A portion of the orders included in backlog reflects an assumed product mix. Under terms of the orders, the exact mix and pricing will be determined in the future as customers select railcar specifications, which may impact the dollar amount of backlog. Marine backlog was $100 million and $61 million as of August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
 Our backlog of railcar units and marine vessels is not necessarily indicative of future results of operations. Certain orders in backlog are subject to customary documentation and completion of terms. Customers may attempt to cancel or modify orders in backlog. Historically, little variation has been experienced between the quantity ordered and the quantity actually delivered, though the timing of deliveries may be modified from time to time. We cannot guarantee that our reported backlog will convert to revenue in any particular period, if at all. 
 Customers 
 Our customers include railroads, leasing companies, financial institutions, shippers, carriers and transportation companies. We have strong, long-term relationships with many of our customers. We believe that our customers preference for high quality products, our technological leadership in developing innovative products, our focus on being highly responsive to our customers needs and competitive pricing of our railcars have helped us maintain our long-standing relationships with our customers. 
 In 2019, revenue from one customer, TTX Company (TTX) accounted for approximately 26% of total revenue, 28% of Manufacturing revenue and 24% of Wheels, Repair & Parts revenue. No other customers accounted for greater than 10% of total revenue. 
 Raw Materials and Components 
 Our products require a supply of materials including steel and specialty components such as brakes, wheels and axles. Specialty components purchased from third parties represent a significant amount of the cost of most freight cars. Our customers often specify particular components and suppliers of such components. Although the number of alternative suppliers of certain specialty components has declined in recent years, there are at least two available suppliers for these components. 
 Certain materials and components are periodically in short supply which could potentially impact production at our new railcar and refurbishment facilities. In an effort to mitigate shortages and reduce supply chain costs, we have entered into strategic alliances and multi-year arrangements for the global sourcing of certain materials and components, we operate a replacement parts business which aids in our vertical integration and we continue to pursue strategic opportunities to protect and enhance our supply chain. We periodically make advance purchases to avoid possible shortages of material due to capacity limitations of component suppliers, shipping and transportation delays and possible price increases. 
 In 2019, the top ten suppliers for all inventory purchases accounted for approximately 52% of total purchases. The top two suppliers accounted for 28% of total inventory purchases in 2019. No other suppliers accounted for more than 10% of total inventory purchases. We believe we maintain good relationships with our suppliers. 
 Competition 
 We are currently one of the two largest railcar manufacturers of the five major railcar manufacturers competing in North America. There are also a handful of specialty builders who focus on niche markets. We believe that in 

The Greenbrier Companies 2019 Annual Report | 5



  Europe we are in the top tier of railcar manufacturers. European freight car manufacturers are largely located in central and eastern Europe where labor rates are lower and work rules are more flexible. We are the leading railcar manufacturer in South America. The railcar manufacturing industry is becoming more global as customers are purchasing railcars from manufacturers outside of their geographic region. In all railcar markets that we serve or participate in, we compete on the basis of quality, price, reliability of delivery, product design and innovation, reputation and customer service and support. 
 Competition in the marine industry is dependent on the type of product produced. There are few competitors that build product types similar to ours. We compete on the basis of price, quality, reliability of delivery, launching capacity and experience with certain product types. 
 Competition in the wheels, repair & parts businesses is dependent on the type of product or service provided. There are many competitors in these businesses. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, timeliness of delivery, customer service, location of shops, price and engineering expertise. 
 There are at least twenty institutions in North America that provide railcar leasing and services similar to ours. Many of them are also customers that buy new railcars from our manufacturing facilities and used railcars from our lease fleet, as well as utilize our management services. Many of these institutions have greater financial resources than we do. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, price, delivery, reputation, service offerings and deal structuring and syndication ability. We believe our strong servicing capability and our ability to sell railcars with a lease attached (syndicate railcars), integrated with our manufacturing, repair shops, railcar specialization and expertise in particular lease structures provide a strong competitive position. 
 Marketing and Product Development 
 In North America, we leverage an integrated marketing and sales effort to coordinate relationships in our various segments. We provide our customers with a diverse range of equipment and financing alternatives designed to satisfy each customers unique needs, whether the customer is buying new equipment, refurbishing existing equipment or seeking to outsource the maintenance or management of equipment. These custom programs may involve a combination of railcar products, leasing, refurbishing and remarketing services. In addition, we provide customized maintenance management, equipment management, accounting and compliance services and proprietary software solutions. 
 In Europe and South America, we maintain relationships with customers through market-specific sales personnel. Our engineering and technical staff works closely with their customer counterparts on the design and certification of railcars. Many European railroads are state-owned and are subject to European Union (EU) regulations covering the tender of government contracts. 
 Through our research and customer relationships, insights are derived into the potential need for new products and services. Marketing and engineering personnel collaborate to evaluate opportunities and develop new products and features. Recent product launches include a newly designed covered hopper specifically made for grain. Research and development costs incurred during the years ended August 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $5.4 million, $6.0 million and $4.2 million, respectively. 
 Patents and Trademarks 
 We believe that manufacturing expertise, the improvement of existing technology and the development of new products may be more important than patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage in our market. Nevertheless, we have obtained a number of U.S. and non-U.S. patents of varying duration, and pending patent applications, registered trademarks, copyrights and trade names. We have a proactive program aimed at protecting our intellectual property and the results from our research and development. 
Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to national, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, air emissions, wastewater discharge, solid and hazardous waste disposal and employee health and safety. Prior to 

6 | The Greenbrier Companies 2019 Annual Report



  acquiring facilities, we usually conduct investigations to evaluate the environmental condition of subject properties and may negotiate contractual terms for allocation of environmental exposure arising from prior uses. We operate our facilities in a manner designed to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Environmental studies have been conducted on certain of our owned and leased properties that indicate additional investigation and some remediation on certain properties may be necessary. 
 Portland Harbor Superfund Site 
 Our Portland, Oregon manufacturing facility is located adjacent to the Willamette River. In December 2000, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classified portions of the Willamette River bed known as the Portland Harbor, including the portion fronting our manufacturing facility, as a federal National Priority List or Superfund site due to sediment contamination (the Portland Harbor Site). Our company and more than 140 other parties have received a General Notice of potential liability from the EPA relating to the Portland Harbor Site. The letter advised us that we may be liable for the costs of investigation and remediation (which liability may be joint and several with other potentially responsible parties) as well as for natural resource damages resulting from releases of hazardous substances to the site. Ten private and public entities, including us (the Lower Willamette Group or LWG), signed an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to perform a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) of the Portland Harbor Site under EPA oversight, and several additional entities did not sign such consent, but nevertheless contributed money to the effort. The EPA-mandated RI/FS was produced by the LWG and cost over $110 million during a 17-year period. We bore a percentage of the total costs incurred by the LWG in connection with the investigation. Our aggregate expenditure during the 17-year period was not material. Some or all of any such outlay may be recoverable from other responsible parties. The EPA issued its Record of Decision (ROD) for the Portland Harbor Site on January 6, 2017 and accordingly on October 26, 2017, the AOC was terminated. 
 Separate from the process described above, which focused on the type of remediation to be performed at the Portland Harbor Site and the schedule for such remediation, 83 parties, including the State of Oregon and the federal government, entered into a non-judicial mediation process to try to allocate costs associated with remediation of the Portland Harbor site. Approximately 110 additional parties signed tolling agreements related to such allocations. On April 23, 2009, we and the other AOC signatories filed suit against 69 other parties due to a possible limitations period for some such claims; Arkema Inc. et al v. A & C Foundry Products, Inc. et al, U.S. District Court, District of Oregon, Case #3:09-cv-453-PK. All but 12 of these parties elected to sign tolling agreements and be dismissed without prejudice, and the case has been stayed by the court until January 16, 2020. The allocation process is continuing in parallel with the process to define the remediation steps. 
 The EPAs January 6, 2017 ROD identifies a clean-up remedy that the EPA estimates will take 13 years of active remediation, followed by 30 years of monitoring with an estimated undiscounted cost of $1.7 billion. The EPA typically expects its cost estimates to be accurate within a range of -30% to +50%, but this ROD states that changes in costs are likely to occur as a result of new data it wanted to collect over a 2-year period prior to final remedy design. The ROD identifies 13 Sediment Decision Units (SDUs). One of the units, RM9W, includes the nearshore area of the river sediments offshore of our Portland, Oregon manufacturing facility as well as upstream and downstream of the facility. It also includes a portion of our riverbank. The ROD does not break down total remediation costs by SDU. The EPAs ROD concluded that more data was needed to better define clean-up scope and cost. On December 8, 2017, the EPA announced that Portland Harbor is one of 21 Superfund sites targeted for greater attention. On December 19, 2017, the EPA announced that it had entered a new AOC with a group of four potentially responsible parties to conduct additional sampling during 2018 and 2019 to provide more certainty about clean-up costs and aid the mediation process to allocate those costs. The parties to the mediation, including us, agreed to help fund the additional sampling. The sampling is completed and the EPA is evaluating possible resulting changes to remediation cost estimates. 
 The ROD does not address responsibility for the costs of clean-up, nor does it allocate such costs among the potentially responsible parties. Responsibility for funding and implementing the EPAs selected cleanup remedy will be determined at an unspecified later date. Based on the investigation to date, we believe that we did not contribute in any material way to contamination in the river sediments or the damage of natural resources in the Portland Harbor Site and that the damage in the area of the Portland Harbor Site adjacent to our property 
 

The Greenbrier Companies 2019 Annual Report | 7



  precedes our ownership of the Portland, Oregon manufacturing facility. Because these environmental investigations are still underway, sufficient information is currently not available to determine our liability, if any, for the cost of any required remediation or restoration of the Portland Harbor Site or to estimate a range of potential loss. Based on the results of the pending investigations and future assessments of natural resource damages, we may be required to incur costs associated with additional phases of investigation, remedial design, or remedial action, and may be liable for damages to natural resources. In addition, we may be required to perform periodic maintenance dredging in order to continue to launch vessels from our launch ways in Portland, Oregon, on the Willamette River, and the rivers classification as a Superfund site could result in some limitations on future dredging and launch activities. Any of these matters could adversely affect our business and Consolidated Financial Statements, or the value of our Portland property. 
 On January 30, 2017 the Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakama Nation sued 33 parties including us as well as the United States and the State of Oregon for costs it incurred in assessing alleged natural resource damages to the Columbia River from contaminants deposited in Portland Harbor. Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation v. Air Liquide America Corp., et al., United States Court for the District of Oregon Case No. 3i17-CV-00164-SB The complaint does not specify the amount of damages the Plaintiff will seek. The case has been stayed until January 16, 2020. 
 Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) Regulation of Portland Manufacturing Operations 
 We have entered into a Voluntary Cleanup Agreement with the DEQ in which we agreed to conduct an investigation of whether, and to what extent, past or present operations at our Portland property may have released hazardous substances into the environment. We have also signed an Order on Consent with the DEQ to finalize the investigation of potential onsite sources of contamination that may have a release pathway to the Willamette River. Interim precautionary measures are also required in the order and we are discussing with the DEQ potential remedial actions which may be required. Our aggregate expenditure has not been material, however we could incur significant expenses for remediation. Some or all of any such outlay may be recoverable from other responsible parties. 
Regulation 
 We must comply with the rules of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) and the administrative agencies it oversees including the Federal Railroad Administration in the U.S. and Transport Canada in Canada who administer and enforce laws and regulations relating to railroad safety. These regulations govern equipment and safety appliance standards for freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate and international commerce throughout North America. The AAR promulgates rules and regulations governing the safety and design of equipment, relationships among railroads and other railcar owners with respect to railcars in interchange, and other matters. The AAR also certifies railcar builders and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on North American railroads. These regulations require maintaining certifications with the AAR as a railcar builder, repair and service provider and component manufacturer, and products sold and leased by us in North America must meet AAR, Transport Canada, and Federal Railroad Administration standards. 
 The primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the ocean-going barge industry are the U.S. Coast Guard, the Maritime Administration of the USDOT, and private industry organizations such as the American Bureau of Shipping. 
 The regulatory environment in Europe consists of a combination of EU regulations and country specific regulations, including a harmonized set of Technical Standards for Interoperability of freight wagons throughout the EU. The EU approval regime has recently been modified to replace country specific approvals with a single, harmonized EU process. The switch could result in short term delays in wagon certification, but over time is expected to streamline the process. The regulatory environment in Brazil consists of oversight from the Ministry of Transportation, the National Agency of Ground Transportation and the National Association of Railroad Transporters. In all other countries, we conform to country specific regulations where applicable.
