ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
MP Materials Corp., including its subsidiaries (the “Company,” “MP Materials,” “we,” “our,” and “us”), is the largest producer of rare earth materials in the Western Hemisphere. The Company owns and operates the Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine and Processing Facility (“Mountain Pass”), the only active rare earth mining and processing site of scale in North America. The Company currently produces a rare earth concentrate that is principally sold pursuant to the Offtake Agreement (as defined in Note 3 “Relationship and Agreements with Shenghe,” in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) to Shenghe (as defined in the “Customers” section below), that, in turn, typically sells that product to refiners in China. These refiners separate the constituent rare earth elements (“REE”) contained in the Company’s concentrate and sell the separated products to their customers. 
Upon completing commissioning of the Stage II optimization project (“Stage II”), the Company anticipates producing and selling separated rare earth products, including neodymium-praseodymium (“NdPr”) oxide. In addition, as a part of its Stage III downstream expansion strategy (“Stage III”), the Company is constructing its initial rare earth metal, alloy and magnet manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, Texas (the “Fort Worth Facility”), where it anticipates manufacturing, among other products, neodymium-iron-boron (“NdFeB”) permanent magnets.
Certain REE serve as critical inputs for the rare earth magnets located inside the electric motors and generators powering carbon-reducing technologies such as electric vehicles (“EVs”) and wind turbines, as well as drones, defense systems, robotics and many other high-growth, advanced technologies. As electrification drives significant global growth in demand for REE, the Company believes global economic trends, geopolitical realities and sustainability mandates are coalescing to further its opportunity to create stockholder value. Further, the Company believes businesses are increasingly prioritizing diversification and security of their global supply chains to reduce reliance on a single producer or region for critical materials. As the only scaled source in North America for critical rare earths, with a processing footprint designed to operate with best-in-class sustainability and an industry-leading cost structure, the Company believes it is well-positioned to thrive as the global economy electrifies.
The Company’s mission is to maximize stockholder returns over the long-term by executing a disciplined business strategy to restore the full rare earth supply chain to the United States of America. The Company believes it will generate positive outcomes for U.S. national security and industry, the U.S. workforce, and the environment.
Rare Earth Industry Overview
Rare earth elements are fundamental building blocks of the modern economy, impacting trillions of dollars in global economic activity through the enablement of transportation, clean energy, robotics, national defense, and consumer electronics products, among others. By economic value, NdPr is the largest segment of the REE market. NdPr is most often utilized in NdPr magnets, which are also commonly referred to as “neo,” “NdFeB,” “NIB,” or permanent magnets, and are made predominantly from an alloy of NdPr, iron and boron. NdFeB magnets are the most widely used type of rare earth magnets and are critical for many advanced technologies that are experiencing strong secular growth, including EVs, drones, defense systems, wind turbines, robotics and many others. The rapid growth of these and other advanced motion technologies is expected to drive substantial demand growth for NdPr and NdFeB magnets.
The REE group includes 17 elements, primarily the 15 lanthanide elements. Lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium and neodymium are considered “light” REE (“LREE”); samarium, europium and gadolinium are often referred to as “medium” REE; while terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium and lutetium are considered “heavy” REE (“HREE”). Two additional elements, yttrium and scandium, are often classified as HREE although they are not lanthanides. Depending upon the rare earth-bearing mineral, the mixture of light, medium and heavy REE will differ. The REE in the Mountain Pass ore body are contained primarily within bastnaesite and related minerals in which LREE dominate.
The aggregate global market for rare earth oxides (“REO”) totaled approximately 186,000 metric tons (“MTs”) in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of approximately 4.1% through 2030, according to research by the CRU Group (“CRU”). Further, CRU estimates that the NdPr segment of the REO market, which makes up the significant majority of the market value, is expected to grow at an 8.6% CAGR through 2030 (excluding the impact of closed loop recycling), well in excess of the overall REO market. This expected growth will be driven by secular growth in demand for NdPr magnets.
Rare earth materials are used in a diverse array of end markets, including:
•Clean-Energy and Transportation Technologies: traction motors in EVs and hybrid electric vehicles, and generators in wind power turbines;
•Consumer and Medical Applications: miniaturization of smart phones and other mobile devices, computing devices, speakers and microphones, as well as fiber optics, lasers, robotics, medical ventilators, precision actuators, and optical sensors;
•Critical Defense Systems: guidance and control systems, communications, global positioning systems, radar and sonar, drones, and railguns; and
•Essential Industrial Infrastructure: power tools, pollution-control systems in traditional internal-combustion automobiles, glass polishing, and LED lighting and phosphors.
Process
The Company has established a three-stage business plan to enable and scale the full rare earth supply chain. Processing of rare earth materials at Mountain Pass includes five primary process steps: (i) mining and crushing; (ii) milling and flotation; (iii) roasting, leaching and impurity removal; (iv) separation and extraction; and (v) product finishing. Having completed Stage I of its optimization plan (“Stage I”) (discussed below), the Company is engaged in the first two of these steps at scale. The rare earth concentrate produced from these steps is marketed to refiners via a distribution arrangement. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company began commissioning the assets required for the latter three steps of production. Upon full commissioning of these process steps, the Company will produce separated rare earth products that will be marketed directly to end users and via distributors, with revenue generated primarily from the magnet supply chain. Lastly, the Company has begun construction of the Fort Worth Facility to convert a portion of the REO produced at Mountain Pass into rare earth metal, alloy, and magnet products to be marketed directly to end users.
Stage I
Following the acquisition of Mountain Pass in July 2017, the Company began implementing Stage I, which was designed to re-establish stable, scaled production of rare earth concentrate leveraging the existing processing facility. Stage I includes mining the primarily bastnaesite ore followed by comminution, which involves crushing and grinding the ore into a milled slurry. Then, the milled bastnaesite slurry is processed by froth flotation, whereby the bastnaesite is carried to the surface while the gangue, or non-desired, elements are suppressed and disposed as tailings.
Since restarting operations from cold-idle status, the Company implemented changes in the milling, flotation and tailings management processes; implemented and continue to advance an improved reagent scheme to improve mineral recovery; and implemented operational best practices. Together, these changes materially increased plant uptime and reliability driving enhanced flotation throughput, REO recovery and production as well as tailings facility reliability and throughput at a significantly lower cost per processed ton. The Company has established its ability to achieve production volumes of REO approximately 3.5x greater than the highest ever production at Mountain Pass prior to the implementation and completion of Stage I. The Company also believes that its Stage I efforts enabled it to achieve world-class production cost levels for rare earth concentrate.
Stage II
Stage II advances the Company’s operations from the production of rare earth concentrate to the separation of individual REE. Significant commissioning activities commenced in the fourth quarter of 2022 beginning with the concentrate drying and roasting circuits, and construction and recommissioning of several Stage II circuits was substantially complete in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company expects the remaining circuits of the Stage II project to be substantially complete and in commissioning in the first half of 2023. The project incorporated upgrades and enhancements to the prior facility process flow to reliably produce separated REE at a lower cost and with an expected smaller environmental footprint per unit of REO produced. As part of Stage II, the Company has reintroduced an oxidizing roasting circuit, reoriented parts of the plant process flow, increased product finishing capacity, improved wastewater management, and made other improvements to materials handling and storage. The reintroduction of the oxidizing roasting circuit allows subsequent stages of the production process to occur at lower temperatures, and with significantly lower volumes of materials and reagents, which supports lower operating and maintenance costs and higher uptime.
The roasting step that oxidizes the rare earth concentrate in a rotary kiln is crucial to ensuring cost-competitiveness. One of the unique attributes of bastnaesite ore is the ability to convert the trivalent cerium in the mixed rare earth concentrate to 
tetravalent cerium that has a low propensity to dissolve, enabling cerium to be separated expediently along with other insoluble gangue elements without selective extraction. Removal of the lower-value cerium early in the Company’s separations process allows for a significant reduction in the mass of material to be separated and finished, thus dramatically reducing the energy, reagents, and wastewater required to produce the higher-value NdPr. Upon reaching run-rate production of REE in Stage II, the Company expects to be a global low-cost, high-volume producer of NdPr oxide, which represents a majority of the value contained in its concentrate.
In February 2022, the Company was awarded a $35.0 million contract by the Department of Defense’s Office of Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment Program to design and build a facility to process HREE. Successful completion of this project will establish, for the first time in many years, commercial-scale processing and separation of HREE in support of commercial and defense applications in the United States. The HREE processing and separations facility (the “HREE Facility”) will be built at Mountain Pass and will be integrated into the rest of the Company’s Stage I and Stage II facilities. The Company is currently advancing the facilitating works, engineering and procurement for the HREE Facility, which is expected to support the separating of HREE contained in the Mountain Pass ore as well as from third-party feedstocks. 
Stage III
The Company’s mission is to restore the full rare earth magnetics supply chain to the U.S. by pursuing opportunities to integrate further downstream into converting NdPr into metal, alloy, and permanent magnet products, as well as advancing magnet recycling capabilities. In February 2022, the Company commenced construction of its initial rare earth metal, alloy and magnet manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, Texas, completing the building shell in September 2022. As currently designed, the Company expects the Fort Worth Facility will produce approximately 1,000 MTs of finished rare earth magnets per year, sufficient to power approximately 500,000 EV motors annually. The rare earth alloy and magnet products produced may also support other key markets, including clean energy, electronic and defense technologies. The Company also expects to supply rare earth alloy flake to other magnet producers to help develop a diverse and resilient U.S. magnet supply chain. The Fort Worth Facility will serve as the business and engineering headquarters for the Company’s growing magnetics division.
In April 2022, the Company entered into a long-term supply agreement with General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) (“GM”) to supply U.S.-sourced and manufactured rare earth materials, alloy and finished magnets for the electric motors in more than a dozen models using GM’s Ultium Platform.
The vertical integration into magnet production would establish MP Materials as the first and only fully-integrated source of supply for rare earth magnets in the Western Hemisphere. By offering magnet customers a complete, end-to-end Western supply chain solution, the Company believes vertical integration represents a material incremental value creation opportunity. The Company believes that the ability to capture significant value from magnet production requires a scaled, steady supply of NdPr, which the Company believes it is uniquely positioned to provide in the Western Hemisphere.
Strategy
Offer the Western Hemisphere a trusted, sustainable source of supply for materials and components that enable the development of critical industries.
More than 60 years of operations at Mountain Pass have demonstrated that the Company’s ore body is one of the world’s largest and highest-grade rare earth resources. The low-volume nature of rare earth mining coupled with the exceptional scale and quality of the ore body results in a resource with significant viability well into the future.
Upon the full commissioning of Stage II, the Company believes Mountain Pass will be one of the largest, most advanced and efficient fully-integrated REO processing facilities in the world, and the only such facility located in the Western Hemisphere. The Company aims to reinvigorate the industrial history of the rare earths supply chain that originated in the United States and provide a domestic alternative to both current and future users of rare earths that helps them avoid the risks associated with the single point-of-failure currently represented by China in the global rare earth supply chain. In addition, the U.S. government is actively seeking to end the country’s reliance on foreign REE sources, and the Company believes that its constructive relationship with key regulatory agencies and the relative stability of U.S. policies provides it with an advantage relative to non-U.S. REE producers.
The global effort to curb carbon emissions and address climate change often focuses on the impact of the transportation system, and the Company believes that its products will play a significant role in advancing those efforts. To date, nearly all U.S. states and the District of Columbia have mandated or offer incentives to support deployment of EVs or alternative fuel vehicles and supporting infrastructure, either through state legislation or private utility incentives within the state, with similar mandates and incentives in other countries globally. Additionally, on August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the 
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 which, among other things, provides several tax incentives to promote clean energy, including tax credits on the purchase of EVs. The NdPr product that the Company intends to produce at Mountain Pass is essential to the permanent magnet motor technology deployed in the significant majority of current EVs. In addition, the Company believes end consumers will demand that the materials used to build these vehicles be extracted sustainably. MP Materials is committed to protecting biodiversity and the Company’s environmental management plans cover biodiversity impacts, waste and noise management, air and water pollution, water extraction and discharge, as well as natural resource and toxic chemical usage. The Company believes that its commitment to environmentally responsible production of REO will be a strong competitive advantage in building relationships with EV manufacturers, who share this commitment to sustainability.
A confluence of geopolitical and economic factors is causing downstream customers, such as automotive original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), to be increasingly focused on supply risk, highlighting the need to develop domestic production of REE and related products. To meet the growth in demand for EVs, the Company believes automotive OEMs will redesign their supply chains to ensure a ready and stable supply of rare earth products as they transition their engine, transmission and motor manufacturing facilities to build EV components. MP Materials aims to capitalize on and accelerate this opportunity by seeking to partner with current and future customers in their efforts to re-position the capital and labor in their supply chain and to meet the growth in electrification.
Leverage the Company’s low-cost position to maximize earnings power in all commodity price environments.
The success of the Company’s business reflects its ability to manage its costs. Its production achievements in Stage I have provided economies of scale to lower production costs per unit of REO produced in concentrate. Furthermore, Stage II was designed to enable the Company to continue to manage its cost structure for separating REE through an optimized facility process flow. This process flow will allow the Company to use significantly less energy and raw materials per ton of separated REO.
Optimization of logistics is also central to maintaining a low-cost position relative to other global producers. The location of Mountain Pass, which is immediately adjacent to Interstate 15, within one hour of truck drive-time to a major railhead and four hours to the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, offers significant transportation advantages that create meaningful cost efficiencies in securing incoming supplies and shipping its final products. The Company believes the self-contained nature of its operations, with mining, milling, separations, and finishing all on one site, creates additional cost advantages and operational risk mitigation and upon the full commissioning of Stage II, the Company’s integrated site will incur lower costs of packaging, handling and transportation as compared to competitors who lack co-located processing.
Further the Company’s mission and ability to capture the full rare earth value chain through downstream integration into rare earth magnet production.
Beyond re-establishing a supply chain for REE in the Western Hemisphere, the Company expects to recognize compelling longer-term opportunities to further its mission through the capture of additional value by pairing its attractive access to a large domestic rare earth supply with growing demands for downstream magnetic materials. The Company is currently pursuing vertical integration through further downstream processing of REO into rare earth metals, alloys and finished magnet products, including recycling. The Company intends to accomplish this through a buy, build and/or joint venture strategy to achieve technical and cost leadership. The Company is developing a greenfield metal, alloy and magnet manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, Texas, with GM as a foundational customer. The Company intends to continue exploring future opportunities to invest in, develop, and/or sponsor new downstream opportunities for REO, rare earth metals and alloys and rare earth products that contribute to the electrification of the industrial economy.
MP Materials believes its successes to date at Mountain Pass demonstrate a competency in identifying undervalued assets, creating a disciplined, execution-focused strategy, and assembling the management talent to create value. The Company intends to apply its experience and skill sets across the rare earth value chain, while allocating capital effectively and responsibly, toward opportunities demonstrated to be in the best interest of its stockholders and consistent with its mission.
Human Capital Resources
The people of MP Materials are the Company’s most valuable asset in progressing toward and ultimately fulfilling the Company’s mission. The Company strives to develop and maintain an owner-operator culture that instills an entrepreneurial spirit where its employees feel motivated and empowered to deliver results through an unwavering commitment to doing what is right in a safe environment. In living up to the owner-operator culture, in 2022, the Company issued a time-vested grant to all then-active, non-executive employees to celebrate the five-year anniversary of MP Materials. The Company believes equity ownership reinforces an unwavering commitment to its workforce and enhances its employees’ sense of their contribution to the Company’s success.
Ensuring the Company attracts, develops and retains top talent across all functions with diverse experiences, backgrounds and perspectives is critical to the Company’s success. In each calendar quarter of 2022, the Company’s employee retention rate was approximately 92% or higher, which the Company believes demonstrates that it has prioritized investments and communication to ensure its team is healthy, incentivized, proud to work for MP Materials, and believes in the Company’s mission.
Workforce Composition
Since relaunching production at Mountain Pass in July 2017, the Company has increased its full-time equivalent (“FTE”) employee base from eight contractors in 2017 to 486 employees as of December 31, 2022, of which approximately 80% were field-based employees. This represents a 33% increase of FTE employees in 2022, on top of a 32% increase in 2021. None of the Company’s employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreements. The Company is committed to creating employment opportunities for U.S. workers, and estimates that Stage II, once fully commissioned, will support approximately 200 full-time employees, of which approximately 75 remain to be hired as of December 31, 2022. In addition, the Company plans for at least 150 full-time employees as part of Stage III, the majority of which will support the Fort Worth Facility.
Health, Safety and Well-Being
The health, safety, and well-being of the Company’s employees, suppliers and communities are a priority, with “Safety” being one of the Company’s six core values, along with “Empowerment,” “Entrepreneurship,” “Integrity,” “Results,” and “Unwavering.” MP Materials is committed to maintaining a strong safety culture and continuing to emphasize the importance of its employees’ role in identifying, mitigating and communicating safety risks. To ensure the ongoing safety of employees and any contractors working on-site, the Company has a clear set of health and safety guidelines in place and routinely conducts trainings. The Company believes that the achievement of superior safety performance is both an important short-term and long-term strategic initiative in managing its operations.
All newly-hired employees at Mountain Pass complete a minimum of 24 hours of Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) training during the onboarding process and must, at a minimum, complete annual refresher training. Following their initial training, depending on their job classification, new employees complete supervised field training specific to their roles and responsibilities. For example, all mill workers go through specific Lock Out/Tag Out/Try Out training, confined-space work and rescue, forklift classroom, and in-the-field training. In total, the Company’s employees completed over 7,500 hours of new hire and/or annual refresher training and 1,792 hours of emergency medical response training, including first aid and CPR, in 2022, the latter of which represented an increase of over 1,000% when compared to 2021, demonstrating the Company’s prioritization of health and safety in light of Stage II. The Company also conducted four planned emergency response drills and 24 real-world responses that included detailed post-accident review and best practice findings.
The Company utilizes a formalized digital data reporting system to track all incidents reportable to the California Occupational Health and Safety Administration and MSHA. The Company tracks lost time injuries, recordable injuries, recordable injury rates, and near-miss reports. MP Materials strongly encourages the reporting of near-miss incidents so that it can mitigate hazards or change procedures to improve workforce safety in advance of any actual incident. In January 2023, the Company passed the 1,000-day milestone without a lost-time injury.
In addition, through continued commitment to monitor, assess and implement guidance and best practices recommended by the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control, the Company has been able to maintain the continuity of the essential services that it provides to its customers, while also managing the continued COVID-19 pandemic and promoting the health, safety, and well-being of its employees, suppliers and communities.
Diversity and Inclusion
MP Materials believes that a diverse and inclusive workforce and Board of Directors produces better overall decision-making for employees, which benefits the organization. In addition to hiring employees with requisite skills, the Company has taken steps to assemble a diverse workforce. As of December 31, 2022, based on employees’ self-reporting, veterans and women represented 4% and 16%, respectively, of the Company’s workforce and 17% of managerial or supervisory positions were occupied by women. As of December 31, 2022, women represented 28% of the Company’s Board of Directors. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, 44% of the Company’s workforce was composed of underrepresented minorities. As the Company progresses with its Stage II and Stage III projects, it will continue to strive to assemble a diverse and inclusive workforce.
Employee Engagement and Development
Employee engagement efforts are critical in ensuring all employees feel heard, respected, and valued, and that applicable actions are taken when feedback is received. The Company provides opportunities for employees to engage with executive management through events such as virtual town hall sessions, family days and routine stand-up briefings. 
Methodical execution is key to ensuring the Company goals are achieved and exceeded. To ensure the Company’s employees receive the feedback they need to grow and thrive in their careers, MP Materials continually reviews and updates its performance-management processes. The Company ensures that new hires receive the feedback and support they need by scheduling periodic performance evaluations three to six months after their introductory periods. Managers hold reviews with all employees no less than annually to give them an opportunity to discuss work performance. This performance management process, rooted in the values of the organization, sets the foundation for applicable goal setting, individual development plans and career pathways going forward.
MP Materials is dedicated to the continual training and development of its employees, especially of those in field operations, to ensure the Company develops future managers and leaders from within its organization. The training starts on an employee’s first day with on-boarding procedures that focus on safety, responsibility, ethical conduct and inclusive teamwork. In addition, the Company has an electrical and instrumentation apprenticeship program in which it pays for its employees to attend trade school to increase their opportunity for future advancement.
Sustainability and Natural Resources
The Company’s business provides a key input to carbon-reducing technologies critical for the transition to a low-carbon economy. Further, MP Materials is solving for the overconcentration of the rare earth supply today while helping to enable a more sustainable future. Sustainability at MP Materials means much more than maintaining environmentally conscious operations; it means caring for the health, safety, and well-being of our employees; encouraging a spirit of joint ownership, entrepreneurship, and continuous growth; supporting the communities that surround us; and operating with integrity. The Company recognizes that it has a responsibility to operate as efficiently as possible to reduce emissions. 
The Company believes Mountain Pass is the world’s cleanest and most environmentally sustainable rare earth production facility. Producing rare earth materials requires significant energy and resources, and can lead to environmental challenges if not carefully managed. MP Materials understands that our natural resources, such as water, are precious and limited. As such, the Company is committed to limiting resource consumption, increasing efficiency, and achieving as light of an environmental footprint as possible. The Company does this, in part, by investing in water recycling, reducing reagent usage, implementing energy reduction initiatives, and utilizing a dry stack tailings process.
The Company believes it is unique among scaled rare earth producers in its use of a dry tailings process that allows recycling of the water used in its milling and flotation circuit and eliminates the need for high-risk wet tailings ponds and traditional impoundment dams. The Company’s tailings and concentrate dewatering methods provide a closed-loop water resource for its beneficiation process satisfying approximately 95% of those processes’ water needs at Mountain Pass. The Company also has a variety of initiatives underway at Mountain Pass to limit freshwater withdrawal and maximize recycling. In addition, the Company remains focused on ensuring the most efficient use of energy to minimize hydrocarbon consumption and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. 
The materials that the Company produces are essential to the supply chains for many technologies that help decarbonize the global economy, improve productivity in the workforce, and better the lives of many. Without MP Materials’ conscientiously-mined materials, not only will the future of low-carbon technologies depend on more highly polluting traditional production methods, but the advanced research and development related to these vital applications and their manufacturing will continue to follow that supply overseas. MP Materials is restoring the resource independence of the United States—removing the single point-of-failure in the supply chain for these products and ensuring that American industry can determine its own future in the automotive, aerospace, renewable energy, and information technologies industries. 
Customers
Currently, the Company sells the vast majority of its rare earth concentrate to Shenghe Resources (Singapore) International Trading Pte. Ltd. (“Shenghe”), a majority-owned subsidiary of Leshan Shenghe Rare Earth Co., Ltd. whose ultimate parent is Shenghe Resources Holding Co., Ltd., a leading global rare earth company listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, under the terms of the Offtake Agreement, which became effective in March 2022.
Under the Offtake Agreement, Shenghe is contractually obligated to purchase the Company’s rare earth concentrate product meeting certain minimum specifications as the exclusive distributor in China on a “take-or-pay” basis (such that they are obliged to pay for product even if they are unable or unwilling to take delivery), with certain exceptions for the Company’s direct sales globally. Shenghe then sells the rare earth concentrate it acquires to customers in China that process the refined products. In addition, at the discretion of the Company, Shenghe may be required to purchase on a “take-or-pay” basis certain non-concentrate rare earth products, although the Company may sell all non-concentrate rare earth products in its sole discretion to customers or end users in any jurisdiction. The Company also regularly enters into short- and long-term sales contracts with other customers for the sale of its rare earth concentrate.
In addition, the Company intends to enter into short- and long-term sales contracts and/or distribution relationships with existing and new customers for separated rare earth products. For certain rare earth products where the market demand is high, the Company may decide not to enter into letters of intent or contracts prior to commencing commercial production.
In April 2022, the Company entered into a long-term supply agreement with GM to supply rare earth alloy flake and finished magnet products, that will be manufactured at the Fort Worth Facility, for the electric motors in GM’s Ultium Platform. The Company is also pursuing sales opportunities to other customers for its future rare earth metal, alloy and magnet products.
Suppliers
The Company uses certain proprietary chemical reagents in its flotation process, which it currently purchases from third-party suppliers. These products are subject to pricing volatility, supply availability and other restrictions and guidelines. In the event of a supply disruption or any other restriction, the Company believes that alternative reagents could be sourced for certain processes. The solvent extraction and finishing processes are highly reliant upon standard commodity reagents.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
The Company relies on a combination of trade secret protection, nondisclosure and licensing agreements, patents and trademarks to establish and protect its proprietary intellectual property rights. The Company utilizes trade secret protection and nondisclosure agreements to protect its proprietary rare earth technology.
Competition
The rare earth mining and processing markets are capital intensive and highly competitive. With continued state-sponsored consolidation, there remain two major rare earth groups in China. These groups and their affiliates control (and/or allocate to unaffiliated third parties) substantially all of China’s quota for concentrate production and rare earth refining. Outside of China, there are only two other producers operating at scale, MP Materials and Lynas Rare Earths Ltd., which processes its rare earth materials in Malaysia.
Environmental and Regulatory Matters
The Company is subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws, certifications, regulations, permits, and other legal requirements applicable to the mining and mineral processing industry, including, without limitation, those pertaining to employee health and safety, air quality standards and emissions, water usage, wastewater and stormwater discharges, GHG emissions, hazardous and radioactive and other waste management, plant and wildlife protection, remediation of contamination, land use, reclamation and restoration of properties, procurement of certain materials used in the Company’s operations, groundwater quality and the use of explosives. Environmental laws and regulation continue to evolve which may require the Company to meet stricter standards and give rise to greater enforcement, result in increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, and result in a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. Future laws, regulations, permits or legal requirements, as well as the interpretation or enforcement of existing requirements, may require substantial increases in capital or operating costs to achieve and maintain compliance or otherwise delay, limit or prohibit operations, or other restrictions upon, the Company’s current or future operations or result in the imposition of fines and penalties for failure to comply.
Complying with these regulations is complicated and requires significant attention and resources. The Company expects to continue to incur significant sums for ongoing operating environmental expenditures, including salaries, and the costs for monitoring, compliance, remediation, reporting, pollution control equipment and permitting.
