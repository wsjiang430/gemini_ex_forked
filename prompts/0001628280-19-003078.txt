Item 1. Business.
Overview
Cerecor Inc. (the Company or "Cerecor") is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company with commercial operations and research and development capabilities. The Company is building a robust pipeline of innovative therapies in neurology, pediatric healthcare, and orphan rare diseases. 
The Company's neurology pipeline is led by CERC-301, which is currently in a Phase I safety study for Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension ("nOH"). The Company is also developing two other neurological clinical and preclinical stage compounds. The Company's pediatric orphan rare disease pipeline is led by CERC-801, CERC-802 and CERC-803. All three of these compounds are preclinical therapies for inherited metabolic disorders known as Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation ("CDGs") by means of substrate replacement therapy. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") has granted Rare Pediatric Disease designation ("RPDD") and Orphan Drug Designation ("ODD") to all three compounds. Under the FDA’s Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher ("PRV") program, upon the approval of a new drug application ("NDA") for the treatment of a rare pediatric disease, the sponsor of such application would be eligible for a PRV that can be used to obtain priority review for a subsequent new drug application or biologics license application. The PRV may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times. The Company plans to leverage the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway for all three compounds to accelerate development and approval. The Company is also in the process of developing one other preclinical pediatric orphan rare disease compound, CERC-913. 
The Company also has a diverse portfolio of marketed products. Our marketed products are led by our prescribed dietary supplements and prescribed drugs. Our prescribed dietary supplements include Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor which are prescription vitamin and fluoride supplements used in infants and children to treat or prevent deficiency of essential vitamins and fluoride. The Company also markets a number of prescription drugs that treat a range of pediatric diseases, disorders and conditions. Cerecor's prescription drugs include Millipred®, Ulesfia®, Karbinal™ ER, AcipHex® Sprinkle™ and Cefaclor for Oral Suspension. Finally, the Company has one marketed medical device, Flexichamber™.
Recent Developments
Ichorion Asset Acquisition
On September 24, 2018, we acquired Ichorion Therapeutics, Inc. for approximately 5.8 million shares of the Company’s Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, as adjusted for estimated working capital.  Consideration for the Ichorion asset acquisition also includes certain development milestones worth up to an additional $15 million, payable either in shares of the Company's common stock or in cash, at the election of the Company. Substantially all of the value of Ichorion was related to one group of similar identifiable assets, which was the in-process research and development ("IPR&D") for the three preclinical therapies for CDGs (CERC-801, CERC-802 and CERC-803) and as such the Company accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition. 
Acquisition of Avadel Products
On February 16, 2018, we acquired all rights in the Avadel U.S. Holdings, Inc’s marketed pediatric products for a nominal cash payment and assumption of certain of Avadel’s financial obligations to Deerfield CSF, LLC, which include a $15 million loan due in January 2021 and certain royalty obligations through February 2026. The acquired products consist of Karbinal™ ER, AcipHex® Sprinkle™, Cefaclor for Oral Suspension, and Flexichamber™. 
Research and Development Updates 
During the third quarter of 2018, the Company enrolled its first patient in the Phase 1 trial for nOH in Parkinson’s Disease. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the single-dose safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of CERC-301 in the relevant patient population from the study, as well as explore the effects on blood pressure of nOH during an orthostatic challenge at escalating dose levels. Data is expected in the first half of 2019. In early 2019, a patent was issued for CERC-301, which provides Cerecor with intellectual property rights to CERC-301 until 2035.
During the fourth quarter of 2018, the FDA awarded RPDD for CERC-801, CERC-802, and CERC-803. Additionally, the FDA granted ODD to each of the three compounds in early 2019, thus granting eligibility for receipt of a PRV upon approval of an NDA. In addition to PRV eligibility, there are numerous benefits associated with receipt of both ODD and RPDD which include 7-year marketing exclusivity (upon approval) in the United States, tax credits (up to 25% of clinical development costs) and waiver of Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA") application fees (filing fees). 
1

The Company also filed an Investigational New Drug ("IND") application with the FDA for CERC-801 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and received a may proceed letter in early 2019. Additionally, the FDA designated Fast Track Designation for CERC-801. Fast Track Designation is granted to drugs being developed for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions where there is an unmet medical need. The purpose of the Fast Track Designation provision is to help facilitate development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious and life-threatening conditions so that an approved product can reach the market expeditiously. The clinical development program for CERC-801 will commence in 2019 with a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers. The goals of the study will be to assess the single dose tolerability and pharmacokinetics of CERC-801. Cerecor seeks to leverage existing clinical and nonclinical data in conjunction with sponsor-initiated studies, such as this Phase 1 study, to accelerate development and approval of CERC-801 via the 505(b)(2) pathway. 
Additionally, the Company expects to file an IND application with the FDA for CERC-802 in 2019 and expects to file an IND application with the FDA for CERC-803 in 2020. 
Recent Financings 
During the first quarter of 2019, the Company closed on an underwritten public offering of common stock for 1,818,182 shares of common stock of the Company, at a price to the public of $5.50 per share ("public price"). Armistice Capital Master Fund Ltd. ("Armistice") participated in the offering by purchasing 363,637 shares of common stock of the Company from the underwriter at the public price. The gross proceeds to the Company, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses and assuming no exercise of the option to purchase additional shares of common stock, were approximately $10.0 million. The net proceeds were approximately $9.0 million. 
During the fourth quarter of 2018, Armistice exercised warrants and acquired an aggregate of 2,857,143 shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, which can be converted to 14,285,715 shares of common stock, for net proceeds of approximately $5.7 million. Additionally, as part of this transaction, the Company issued warrants for 4,000,000 shares of common stock (see "December 2018 Armistice Private Placement" in Note 13 below for a description of this transaction). 
 During the third quarter of 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with Armistice, pursuant to which the Company sold 1,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock for net proceeds of approximately $3.9 million (see "Armistice Private Placements" in Note 13 below for a description of this transaction). 
Lachlan Pharmaceuticals 
2

In November 2017, the Company acquired TRx and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Zylera. The previous owners of TRx beneficially own more than 10% of our outstanding common stock. Zylera, which is our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into the First Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement with Lachlan, effective December 18, 2015. Pursuant to the Lachlan Agreement, Lachlan named Zylera as its exclusive distributor of Ulesfia in the United States and agreed to supply Ulesfia to Zylera exclusively for marketing and sale in the United States.
Zylera is obligated to purchase a minimum of 20,000 units per year, or approximately $1.2 million worth of product, from Lachlan, subject to certain termination rights. Zylera must pay Lachlan $58.84 per unit and handling fees that are equal to $3.66 per unit of fully packaged Ulesfia in 2018, and escalate at a rate of 10% annually, as well as reimburse Lachlan for all product liability insurance fees incurred by Lachlan. The Lachlan Agreement also requires that Zylera make certain cumulative net sales milestone payments and royalty payments to Lachlan with a $3.0 million annual minimum payment unless and until there has been a “Market Change” involving a new successful competitive product. Lachlan is obligated to pay identical amounts to an unrelated third party from which it obtained rights to Ulesfia, with the payments ultimately flowing to Summers Laboratories, Inc. (“Summers Labs”). Because of the dispute described below, the Company has not made any payments to Lachlan under the Lachlan Agreement subsequent to the acquisition date.
On December 10, 2016, Zylera informed Lachlan that a Market Change had occurred due to the introduction of Arbor Pharmaceuticals' lice product, Sklice®.  On June 5, 2017, Lachlan and Zylera entered into joint legal representation along with other unrelated third parties in negotiation and arbitration of a dispute with Summers Labs regarding the existence of a Market Change and the concomitant obligations of the parties. The arbitration panel issued an interim ruling on October 23, 2018 that no market change had occurred up to and including the date of the hearing. The arbitration panel issued a second interim ruling on December 26, 2018. The second interim award rejected Summers Labs' request to accelerate future minimum royalties, however, it ruled in favor of Summers Labs that it is owed reimbursement for all reasonable costs and expenses, including legal fees, by Shionogi, as well as interest, as stipulated in the contract. The arbitration panel issued a final award on March 1, 2019 that dictated the final amount of reimbursable costs and interest as contemplated in the second interim ruling. The final award has no direct bearing on the Company as the Company was not a named defendant to the original claim by Summers Labs and a federal court denied Zylera's ability to be a counterclaimant in the matter. Furthermore, the Company is not subject to the guarantee or interest provisions identified in the second ruling as these elements of the contractual relationship were not passed down to the Company’s agreement with Lachlan. However, the Company has interpreted this ruling's impact on the Lachlan agreement to mean that a market change has not occurred, and the minimum purchase obligation and minimum royalty provisions of the contract are active and due for any prior periods as well as going forward for any future periods. 
The Company has recognized a $7.8 million liability for these minimum obligations in accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2018. Under the terms of the TRx Purchase Agreement, the former TRx owners are required to indemnify the Company for 100% of all pre-acquisition losses related this arbitration, including legal costs, and possible minimum payments in excess of $1 million. Furthermore, the former TRx owners are required to indemnify the Company for 50% of post-acquisition Ulesfia losses, which would include losses resulting from having to fund these minimum obligations. The Company has recorded an indemnity receivable of $4.9 million in other receivables as of December 31, 2018, which the Company believes is fully collectible. The receivable is net of $1.9 million collection made in the fourth quarter of 2018 from a full cash escrow release with the former TRx owners from the escrow that was established as a part of the TRx acquisition. The post-acquisition minimum obligations net of amounts recorded within the indemnity receivable of $2.2 million has been recorded in cost of product sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. If the Company fails to make these minimum obligations timely then the Lachlan Agreement may be terminated by Lachlan, in which case the Company would no longer be able to sell the Ulesfia product, but it would also not be subject to future minimum obligations. Lachlan has not requested payment for the minimum obligations. 
Our Strategy
The Company is building a robust pipeline of innovative therapies in neurology, pediatric healthcare, and orphan rare diseases. We plan to use the proceeds generated from the profits of our portfolio of pediatric products toward the development of drug candidates that have unique mechanisms of action and can change the lives of patients with rare orphan diseases in pediatrics and neurology. We systematically identify and pursue potential development candidates, ideally those for which human proof of concept exists in the intended indication, for either the target or the compound. We target conditions where current treatments fail to address unmet medical needs, and where we believe we can apply clinical strategies to increase efficacy signal detection with a view to optimizing the clinical development and regulatory pathway for our product candidates.
Our strategy for increasing shareholder value includes: 

• | Advancing our pipeline of compounds through development and to regulatory approval;

3


• | Pursuing targeted, differentiated preclinical and clinical stage product candidates;


• | Acquiring or licensing rights to clinically meaningful and differentiated products that are already on the market for pediatric use or in late-stage development for pediatric indications; and


• | Growing sales of the existing commercial products in our portfolio, including by identifying and investing in growth opportunities such as new treatment indications and new geographic markets.

Product Pipeline Assets
The following table summarizes key information about our product candidates and further detail regarding each product candidate follows:
Neurology Pipeline Assets

• | CERC‑301: Orphan Neurological Indication. CERC-301 is currently being developed as an adjunct therapy in Parkinson’s Disease patients suffering from nOH, which is a condition that is part of a larger category called orthostatic hypotension ("OH") also known as postural hypotension. nOH is caused by dysfunction in the autonomic nervous system and causes people to feel faint when they stand or sit up. CERC‑301 belongs to a class of compounds known as antagonists of the N‑methyl‑D‑aspartate ("NMDA") receptor, a receptor subtype of the glutamate neurotransmitter system that is responsible for controlling neurologic adaptation. We believe CERC‑301 selectively blocks the NMDA receptor subunit 2B ("NR2B") (also called GluN2B). 

CERC‑301 has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in over 350 patients and healthy volunteers during several clinical investigations. Throughout various trials, CERC-301 produced consistent and robust increases in blood pressure, which we believe will provide long-term clinical benefit of reducing the frequency and severity of symptoms associated with nOH. We anticipate progressing development into Phase 2 efficacy and dose ranging studies in nOH with the goal of obtaining the first chronic use label with symptomatic benefit. Currently approved therapies for nOH, Nothera (droxidopa) and Midodrine, have conditional approval (Sub-part H) and have not demonstrated and are not labeled for long-term 
4

clinical benefits. As such, we believe CERC-301 may be well suited to address unmet medical needs in neurologic indications. 
While listed as an orphan condition affecting less than 200,000 patients in the United States, nOH results from failure of the autonomic nervous system to regulate blood pressure in response to postural change, due to an inadequate release of norepinephrine. This leads to both orthostatic hypotension upon standing and supine hypertension when lying. nOH is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple systems atrophy, Parkinson’s disease, and primary autonomic failure. 

• | CERC‑406 and COMTi Platform: Adjunctive Treatment of Parkinson's Disease. CERC-406 is a preclinical candidate from our proprietary platform of compounds that inhibit catechol-O-methyltransferase ("COMT") within the brain, which we refer to as our COMTi platform. We believe it may have the potential to be developed for the adjunct treatment of Parkinson’s Disease. Preclinically, CERC-406 has demonstrated a greater selectivity for Central Nervous System COMT as compared to peripheral COMT, which we believe may represent an opportunity to treat both the neuromuscular and cognitive manifestations of Parkinson's Disease while minimizing the systemic toxicities associated with the currently approved COMTi’s. 

COMT is an enzyme that is critical for the inactivation and metabolism of dopamine and its inhibition in the brain has potential applicability in treating subjects with neuropsychiatric conditions, including major depressive disorder ("MDD"), schizophrenia, Parkinson’s Disease and pathological gambling. CERC-406 is our first preclinical candidate from the COMTi platform, specifically designed to preferentially inhibit Central Nervous System COMT over peripheral COMT.
COMT inhibitors have shown to be clinically effective in increasing the “on” and decreasing the “off” times of levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor therapy in PD patients. Tolcapone is the only approved COMTi that crosses the blood brain barrier but is associated with serious liver toxicities. In preclinical testing, CERC-406 had a lower potential for peripheral (non-CNS) side effects, rapid absorption and bioavailability, good brain penetration and a favorable dose dependent biomarker profile. We have also observed in rats, that CERC-406 appears to have an “off rate” on brain COMT that is slower than tolcapone, implying it may have a superior duration of effect. 
Similarly, CERC-425 is an orally active small molecule, COMT inhibitor. The Company has de-prioritized the development of CERC-425 in order to focus on CERC-406, as described above. 


• | CERC-611: Adjunctive Treatment of Partial-Onset Seizures in Epilepsy. CERC-611 is a potent and selective antagonist of transmembrane alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid ("AMPA") receptor regulatory protein (“TARP”)-γ8-dependent AMPA currently in development as an adjunct therapy for refractory partial-onset seizures. TARPs are a recently discovered family of proteins that have been found to associate with, and modulate the activity of, AMPA receptors. TARP γ8-dependent AMPA receptors are localized primarily in the hippocampus, a region of the brain with importance in complex partial seizures and particularly relevant to seizure origination and/or propagation. 

We believe CERC-611 is the first drug candidate to selectively target and functionally block region-specific AMPA receptors after oral dosing, which we believe may improve the efficacy and side effect profile of CERC-611 over current anti-epileptics. Research also suggests that selectively targeting individual TARPs may enable selective modulation of specific brain circuits without globally affecting synaptic transmission. The clinical strategy for CERC-611 is currently being reevaluated due to a partial clinical hold.  The exposure limits imposed by the agency currently allows for subtherapeutic dosing.  We are investigating opportunities to broaden the exposure limits. We intend to develop CERC-611 as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients with epilepsy.

• | CERC-800 Series (CERC-801, CERC-802, and CERC-803): Substrate Replacement Therapies for CDGs. CERC-801, CERC-802 and CERC-803 represent genetically-targeted, small molecule, substrate replacement therapies with established therapeutic utility for the treatment of CDGs. CDGs are a rapidly expanding group of rare Inborn Errors of Metabolism ("IEMs") due to defects in glycosylation. Glycosylation is the process by which carbohydrate complexes are created, modified and attached to proteins and lipids, creating glycoconjugates that are essential for cell structure and function in all tissues and organs. CDG is caused by a specific inherited mutation and more than 100 CDGs have been identified to date. CDGs typically present in infancy and can be associated with a broad spectrum of symptoms that include severe, disabling or life-threatening cases. Oral administration of CERC-801, CERC-802 or CERC-803 can replenish critical metabolic intermediates that are reduced or absent due to genetic mutation, overcoming single enzyme

5

defects to support glycoprotein synthesis, maintenance and function. CERC-801 utilizes D-galactose as the active pharmaceutical ingredient to treat Phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) Deficiency; CERC-802 utilizes D-mannose as the active pharmaceutical ingredient to treat Mannose-Phosphate Isomerase (MPI) Deficiency; and CERC-803 utilizes L-fucose as the active pharmaceutical ingredient to treat Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Type II (LADII).
The FDA has granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Orphan Drug Designation to CERC-801, CERC-802 and CERC-803.  Under the FDA’s PRV program, upon the approval of an NDA for the treatment of a rare pediatric disease, the sponsor of such application would be eligible for a PRV that can be used to obtain priority review for a subsequent new drug application or biologics license application. The PRV may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times. Furthermore, we plan to leverage the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway for all three compounds to accelerate development and approval. 
The below chart depicts the benefits associated with ODD and RPDD for each of the CERC-800 series compounds: 

• | CERC-913: ProTide Nucleotide for Mitochondrial Disorder. CERC-913 is a genetically-targeted, small molecule substrate replacement therapy that uses a prodrug approach to overcome a single enzyme defect to treat mitochondrial DNA mtDNA depletion syndromes ("MDS"). A prodrug is a medication or compound that, after administration, is metabolized into a pharmacologically active substance. The ProTide prodrug platform is a clinically-validated approach to nucleoside monophosphate prodrugs. Some patients suffering from MDS lack a nucleoside kinase that produces nucleoside monophosphates for mtDNA synthesis. Direct substrate replacement of nucleoside monophosphates is impractical due to instability in plasma and low cell permeability. By masking a nucleoside monophosphate as a prodrug with improved drug-like properties, we can deliver the substrate to the desired subcellular compartment and bypass the missing nucleoside kinase. CERC-913 is intended for pediatric MDS patients with symptoms that manifest primarily in the liver, with 50% of patients experiencing liver failure in the first few years of life.

• | Ulesfia®: Ulesfia® Lotion is indicated for the topical treatment of head lice infestation in patients six months of age and older. This product is not toxic to lice but kills them by depriving them of oxygen. 


• | Karbinal™ ER: Carbinoxamine is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergy, hay fever, and the common cold. These symptoms include rash, watery eyes, itchy eyes/nose/throat/skin, cough, runny nose, and sneezing. This medication works by blocking a certain natural substance (histamine) that your body makes during an allergic reaction. By blocking another natural substance made by your body (acetylcholine), it helps dry up some body fluids to relieve symptoms such as watery eyes and runny nose. 


• | AcipHex® Sprinkle™: AcipHex® Sprinkle™ or Rabeprazole is used to treat certain stomach and esophagus problems (such as acid reflux, ulcers). It works by decreasing the amount of acid your stomach makes. It relieves symptoms such as heartburn, difficulty swallowing, and persistent cough. This medication helps heal acid damage to the stomach and esophagus, helps prevent ulcers, and may help prevent cancer of the esophagus. Rabeprazole belongs to a class of drugs known as proton pump inhibitors ("PPIs"). 


• | Cefaclor for Oral Suspension: This medication is a second-generation cephalosporin-type antibiotic used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections (e.g., middle ear, skin, urine and respiratory tract infections). It works by stopping the growth of bacteria. This antibiotic only treats bacterial infections. It will not work for viral infections (e.g., common cold, flu). Unnecessary use or overuse of any antibiotic can lead to its decreased effectiveness. 


• | Flexichamber™: When a child is diagnosed with asthma, doctors often prescribe a metered dose inhaler ("MDI") - commonly referred to as an inhaler. Using an inhaler requires refined coordination and inhalation techniques that can be tricky, especially for small children. To ensure the child receives the optimal dose, many doctors prescribe a spacer - such as Flexichamber - to be used with an inhaler. Flexichamber was designed to overcome problems that patients commonly experience when using just an inhaler to administer their asthma medication. When used properly and as prescribed by a doctor, Flexichamber helps deliver asthma medication from the inhaler to tissue deep within the lungs, reduces the amount of medication that settles onto the child’s mouth and throat, and allows caregivers to visually monitor breathing techniques and provide additional instructions if needed.

Upon approval by the FDA, NCEs are entitled to market and data exclusivity in the United States with respect to generic drug competition for a period of five years from the date of FDA approval, even if the related patents have expired.
Manufacturing
We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We rely on contract manufacturing organizations ("CMOs") to produce our drug candidates in accordance with applicable provisions of the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice ("GMP") regulations for use in our clinical studies. The manufacture of pharmaceuticals is subject to extensive GMP regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control.
Sales and Marketing

We promote our commercially marketed products through a sales force of 42 territory managers. During the third quarter of 2018, the Company initiated an expansion of the sales force, which is expected to be largely completed during the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we collaborated, on a limited basis, with a third-party sales force to market specific products to health care professionals. In the future, we may collaborate with a third-party sales force to market specific products on a limited basis. Our team is comprised of a complete support staff internally and we also partner with numerous world class vendors to increase our effectiveness and efficiency. 
     As pediatric specialists, our reach and frequency with key physicians and pharmacies is data driven to maximize our coverage of these important healthcare professionals. With established commercial operations, the Company is poised to be both flexible and scalable based on opportunities within the market.

We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as numerous academic and research institutions and governmental agencies, both in the United States and abroad. We compete, or will compete, with existing and new products being developed by our competitors. Some of these competitors are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that our research and development programs target. 
Competition—Neurology Pipeline Assets 

• | CERC‑301: Orphan Neurological Indication. CERC‑301 will compete with other drugs used as therapies for the treatment of nOH. Medication management of nOH is added when patients have persistent symptoms despite these non-pharmacological approaches. Fludrocortisone is a synthetic mineralocorticoid that acts to retain sodium and water. Midodrine is an alpha-adrenergic agonist that can increase blood pressure by increasing peripheral vascular resistance. Pyridostigmine has also been used to treat nOH. Pyridostigmine is a peripheral inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, which can cause a mild increase in standing blood pressure without significantly increasing supine blood pressure. Droxidopa (L-threo-3-4-dihydroxyphenylserine ("L-threo DOPS")) is an oral prodrug converted by decarboxylation to norepinephrine in both the central and the peripheral nervous systems. 


• | CERC-406 and COMTi Platform: Adjunctive Treatment of Parkinson's Disease. There are no approved pharmacologic treatments for cognitive impairment associated in the U.S. at this time. In March 2015, vortioxetine (Brintellix®), marketed in the United States by Lundbeck Pharmaceuticals, which was originally developed and commercialized for the treatment of MDD, received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency to expand the label to include information for cognitive function in patients with depression. A supplemental application for the addition of clinical data to the FDA approved product label for Brintellix was not approved by the FDA. 

Our potential products for the treatment of the cognitive and motoric impairment of Parkinson’s disease may compete with existing COMT inhibitors Comtan (entacapone), marketed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. ("Novartis") (licensed from Orion), Tasmar (tolcapone), marketed by Valeant, and Stalevo (fixed combinations of entacapone and levodopa/carbidopa), also marketed by Novartis (licensed from Orion). Comtan, Tasmar, and Stalevo are all generic in the United States. Currently, no treatments are approved for cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease.

• | CERC-611: Adjunctive Treatment of Partial-Onset Seizures in Epilepsy. The epilepsy market is crowded with current therapies targeting a variety of mechanisms, including gamma-aminobutyric acid ("GABA") receptor agonism, T-type calcium channel blockers, sodium channel modulators, synaptic vesicle protein SV2A modulation, and inhibition of GABA transaminase. More recently, a new class of AMPA receptor antagonists have been approved for the treatment of epilepsy. 

CERC-611, if we are successful in developing it and it gains regulatory approval, would compete with a number of branded and generic anti-epileptic drugs. A few major pharmaceutical companies (GSK (Lamictal/XR), Pfizer (Lyrica)) and specialty players (UCB (Vimpat, Keppra), Lundbeck (Sabril) and Supernus (Trokendi XR)) dominate the anti-epilepsy drug therapy market. New market entrants such as Sage Pharmaceuticals and GW Pharmaceuticals are targeting difficult to treat orphan patient populations such as super-refractory status epilepticus and Dravet Syndrome, respectively. To our knowledge, there are no other TARP γ-8-dependent AMPA receptor antagonist s in development other than CERC-611.
Competition—Pediatric Rare Orphan Disease Pipeline Assets 
9


• | CERC‑800 series (CERC-801, CERC-802 and CERC-803): Substrate Replacement Therapy for CDGs. Currently there are no FDA or EMEA approved products for the treatment of CDG using the following: D-Galactose Substrate replacement therapy for PGM1 CDG (CERC-801), Mannose Phosphate Isomerase ("MPI") deficiency, also known as MPI-CDG (CERC-802), and L-Fucose Substrate replacement therapy for the treatment of Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Type II (LADII), also known as SLC35C1-CDG (CERC-803). 


• | CERC-913: ProTide Nucleotide for Mitochondrial Disorder. Currently there are no FDA or EMEA approved products for the treatment of Mitochondrial Depletion Syndrome MDA using a ProTide Nucleotide therapy for Mitochondrial DNA Depletion Syndrome ("MDS").

Competition—Commercially Marketed Products 
Across all our product lines there is over-the-counter ("OTC") branded and generic competition. However, we believe our products do have significant aspects of clinical and competitive differentiation in the marketplace that allows us to effectively market, compete and grow market share in the face of competition.

• | Poly-Vi-Flor / Tri-Vi-Flor: Poly-Vi-Flor / Tri-Vi-Flor primarily compete against generic prescription multi-vitamin fluoride market and the brands of FLORIVA and QFLORA. Our primary point of differentiation is Metafolin and that our form of Metafolin is a body-ready folate to aid in cell reproduction. As well, we offer formulations that are patient friendly in terms of size of tablet and taste of medication ensuring compliance of their daily fluoride vitamin supplementation. 


• | Millipred®: Millipred® Tablets primarily compete in the generic prednisolone market. We believe our primary point of differentiation is that we offer the lowest strength prednisolone in the market place allowing HCPs greater flexibility when dosing a glucocorticoid steroid across a variety of pediatric indications. Additionally, Millipred® utilizes the proprietary double taste-masking technology to provide a pleasant grape taste with no bitterness, which makes the product easier to administer to children. 


• | Ulesfia®: Ulesfia® competes in a market place that is primarily made up of step-wise therapy utilizing OTC remedies. Once into the prescription marketplace Sklice® is the market leader differentiated primarily by pricing and contracting. However, Ulesfia is the leader in providing a non-neuro toxic / non-pesticide for treating headlice. 


• | Karbinal™ ER: Karbinal™ ER faces competition from OTC products such as non-sedating antihistamines, sedating antihistamines as well as nasal steroids. Karbinal’s greatest point of differentiation is our LIQUIDRX Technology that allows for extended release and flexible BID dosing. This feature makes Karbinal ER the only BID first generation antihistamine. Additionally, Karbinal has a significant anticholinergic / drying effect on the symptoms associated with seasonal, perennial, as well as vasomotor allergic rhinitis. 


• | AcipHex® Sprinkle™: AcipHex® Sprinkle™ primarily faces competition from the OTC Proton Pump Inhibitors, however those products (Nexium OTC and Prilosec OTC) are not indicated for children less than 18 years of age. In the branded space the primary competition is from Nexium Packets. We clinically differentiate AcipHex Sprinkle as the only PPI that is proven to demonstrate esophageal mucosal healing as determined by endoscopy in children less than 18 years of age. 


• | Cefaclor for Oral Suspension: Cefaclor for Oral Suspension faces significant competition from the generic antibiotics of amoxicillin as well as Omnicef / Ceftin. We feel our keep point of differentiation is through our clinical positioning for appropriate patients who have failed first line therapies. Cefaclor is the best first choice as a second line treatment for antibiotics that have failed patients suffering from streptococcus, urinary tract infections and otitis media. Cefaclor is a second generation antibiotic indicated against a broad range of pathogens with a broad range of indications. 


• | Flexichamber™: Flexichamber™ is a patented and proprietary design that allows a patient with a necessary spacer that is conveniently portable. There are numerous competitors in the market place with the main competition being AreoChamber. Flexichamber’s collapsibility / portability is unique compared to the competition. 

Overall Competitive Climate and Risks
In addition, the companies described above and other competitors may have a variety of drugs in development or may be awaiting FDA approval that could reach the market and become established before we have a product to sell. Our competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could further limit the market for any drugs that we may develop. Many of our 
10

competitors are using technologies or methods different or similar to ours to identify and validate drug targets and to discover novel small compound drugs. Many of our competitors and their collaborators have significantly greater experience than we do in the following:

• | identifying and validating targets;


• | screening compounds against targets;


• | preclinical and clinical trials of potential pharmaceutical products; and


• | obtaining FDA and other regulatory clearances.

In addition, many of our competitors and their collaborators have substantially greater advantages in the following areas:

• | capital resources;


• | research and development resources;


• | manufacturing capabilities; and


• | sales and marketing.

Smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through proprietary research discoveries and collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. Many of our competitors have products that have been approved or are in advanced development. We face competition from other companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific and management personnel and for licenses to additional technologies. Our competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, may succeed in developing technologies or drugs that are more effective, safer, and more affordable or more easily administered than ours and may achieve patent protection or commercialize drugs sooner than us. Developments by others may render our product candidates or our technologies obsolete. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.
For additional information on risks regarding our competition, refer to the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report Form 10-K.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export, pricing, and government contracting related to pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
United States Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, or other actions, such as the FDA’s delay in review of or refusal to approve a pending NDA, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or study termination, issuance of Warning Letters or Untitled Letters, mandated modifications to promotional materials or issuance of corrective information, requests for product recalls, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, deferred prosecution agreements, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow product import or export, total or partial suspension of or restriction of or imposition of other requirements relating to production or distribution, injunctions, fines, debarment from government contracts and refusal of future orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, FDA debarment, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment.
FDA Marketing Approval
Obtaining FDA marketing approval for new products may take many years and require the expenditure of substantial financial resources. In order for FDA to determine that a product is safe and effective for the proposed indication, the product must first undergo testing in animals (preclinical studies). The data generated from preclinical studies is used to support the filing of an 
11

IND Application under which human studies are conducted. There are three phases of human testing generally conducted under an IND, following GCP guidelines:

• | Phase 1 studies evaluate the safety of the drug, generally in normal, healthy volunteers;


• | Phase 2 studies evaluate safety and efficacy, as well as explore dosing ranges; these studies are typically conducted in patient volunteers who suffer from the particular disease condition that the drug is designed to treat; and


• | Phase 3 studies evaluate safety and efficacy of the product, at specific doses, in a large clinical trial

In addition to human testing in clinical studies, the manufacturing process (Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls ("CMC")) of the potential product must be developed in accordance with FDA cGMP regulations. Prior to the approval of a new product, The FDA will inspect the facilities at which the proposed drug product is manufactured, to ensure cGMP compliance.

The safety and efficacy data generated from the clinical study phases described above, CMC information, animal data and proposed labeling are used as the basis to support a NDA submission to FDA. The preparation of an NDA requires the expenditure of substantial funds and the commitment of substantial resources. Additionally, in most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee, to be filed at the time of submission. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing and full review.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing, or other information, in order for FDA to reconsider the application. The FDA has a review goal of completing its review of 90% of resubmissions within two or six months after receipt, depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
The development and approval of new drugs requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Data obtained from the development program are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations. These instances may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the products. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval.
FDA Post‑Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, manufacturing, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product and drug shortages. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. The FDA may also impose post‑approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post‑marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product becomes available in the market.

Additionally, the FDA strictly regulates the labeling, advertising and promotion of products under an approved NDA. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off‑label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly marketed or promoted off‑label uses may be subject to significant liability, including criminal and civil penalties under the FDCA and False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs debarment from government contracts and refusal of future orders under existing contracts, and mandatory compliance programs under corporate integrity agreements or deferred prosecution agreements.
Other Regulations of the Healthcare Industry
12

In addition to FDA regulations for the marketing of pharmaceutical products, there are various other state and federal laws that may restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These include the following:

• | The federal Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback laws, which prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual, or furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;


• | Other Medicare laws, regulations, rules, manual provisions and policies that prescribe the requirements for coverage and payment for services performed by our customers, including the amount of such payment;


• | The federal False Claims Act which imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals and entities who submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government;


• | The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), which prohibits certain payments made to foreign government officials;


• | State and foreign law equivalents of the foregoing and state laws regarding pharmaceutical company marketing compliance, reporting and disclosure obligations; and


• | The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("ACA"), which among other things changes access to healthcare products and services; creates new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries; changes rebates and prices for health care products and services; and requires additional reporting and disclosure.

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, regulations, rules or policies or any other law or governmental regulation, or if interpretations of the foregoing change, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post‑marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti‑fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. This is currently not applicable as none of our products are currently sold in a foreign country.
Coverage and Reimbursement
The commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third‑party payers provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our therapeutic product candidates. In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third‑party payers are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage, attempting to limit reimbursement levels or regulate the price of drugs and other medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. For example, in the United States, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. Federal programs also impose price controls through mandatory ceiling prices on purchases by federal agencies and federally funded hospitals and clinics and mandatory rebates on retail pharmacy prescriptions paid by Medicaid and Tricare. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government programs may result in lower reimbursement for our product candidates or exclusion of our product candidates from coverage. Moreover, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payers and other governmental payers develop their coverage and reimbursement policies.
In addition, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, competition within therapeutic classes, availability of generic equivalents, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general. The cost containment measures that healthcare payers and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third‑party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part.
Impact of Healthcare Reform on Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 ("the MMA") imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll 
13

in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription, pharmacy drugs pursuant to federal regulations. Part D plans include both standalone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. In general, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors have flexibility regarding coverage of Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class, with certain exceptions. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our future products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be discounted, thereby lowering the net price realized on our sales to pharmacies. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non‑governmental payers.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payers, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third‑party payers do not consider our product candidates to be cost‑effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product candidates, once approved, as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, most recently, the Affordable Care Act, which became law in March 2010 and substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the Affordable Care Act establishes an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; expansion of Medicaid benefits and a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; and expansion of the 340B drug discount program that mandates discounts to certain hospitals, community centers and other qualifying providers. In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the United States healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge or the amounts of reimbursement available for our product candidates once they are approved.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products
Hatch‑Waxman Patent Exclusivity
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application ("ANDA") or 505(b)(2) NDA. Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product 
14

that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent through in vitro or in vivo testing or otherwise to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. 505(b)(2) NDAs generally are submitted for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form or indication.
The ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is required to provide a certification to the FDA in the product application concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:

• | the required patent information has not been filed;


• | the listed patent has expired;


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the new product.

Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except when the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent or if the listed patent is a patented method of use for which approval is not being sought. A certification that the proposed product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or does not indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of notice of the Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant or other period determined by a court.
Hatch‑Waxman Non‑Patent Exclusivity
Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five‑year period of non‑patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non‑infringement.
The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three‑year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three‑year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five‑year and three‑year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Pediatric Exclusivity. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non‑patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non‑patent exclusivity period described above. This six‑month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents.
15

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity. The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, or affecting more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug available in the United States will be recovered from United States sales. Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain orphan designation if there is a drug already approved by the FDA that is intended for the same indication and that is considered by the FDA to be the same drug as the already approved drug. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user‑fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is generally entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. 
Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding drug development and commercialization. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
European Union Drug Approval Process
To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the European Union, we may submit marketing authorization applications ("MAAs") either under the so‑called centralized or national authorization procedures.
Centralized procedure
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization following a favorable opinion by the European Medicines Agency ("EMA") that is valid in all European Union member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions. The centralized procedure is optional for products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee of Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP"). Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop‑clocks.
National authorization procedures
There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
•Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
•Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
In the European Union, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization.
