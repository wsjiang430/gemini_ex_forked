ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
LKQ Corporation ("LKQ" or the "Company") is a global distributor of vehicle products, including replacement parts, components, and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty products and accessories to improve the performance, functionality and appearance of vehicles.
Buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources: new products produced by original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"); new products produced by companies other than the OEMs, which are referred to as aftermarket products; recycled products obtained from salvage vehicles; used products that have been refurbished; and used products that have been remanufactured. Collectively, we refer to these four sources that are not new OEM products as alternative parts. We distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops, including aftermarket collision and mechanical products; recycled collision and mechanical products; refurbished collision products such as wheels, bumper covers and lights; and remanufactured engines and transmissions.
We are a leading provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products and alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products, with our sales, processing, and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the United States and Canada. We are also a leading provider of alternative vehicle replacement and maintenance products in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Benelux region (Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg), Italy, Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Austria, and various other European countries. In addition to our wholesale operations, we operate self service retail facilities across the U.S. that sell recycled automotive products from end-of-life vehicles. We are also a leading distributor of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories reaching most major markets in the U.S. and Canada.
We are organized into four operating segments: Wholesale - North America, Europe, Specialty, and Self Service. We aggregate our Wholesale - North America and Self Service operating segments into one reportable segment, North America, resulting in three reportable segments: North America, Europe and Specialty. See Note 16, "Segment and Geographic Information" to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information by reportable segment and by geographic region.
HISTORY
We were initially formed in 1998 through the combination of a number of wholesale recycled products businesses located in Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. We subsequently expanded through internal development and approximately 270 acquisitions of aftermarket, recycled, refurbished, and remanufactured product suppliers and manufacturers; self service retail businesses; and specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories suppliers. Our most significant acquisitions include:

• | 2007 acquisition of Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc., which, at the time of acquisition, was the leading domestic distributor of aftermarket products, including collision replacement products, paint products, refurbished steel bumpers, bumper covers and alloy wheels.


• | 2011 acquisition of Euro Car Parts Holdings Limited ("ECP"), a vehicle mechanical aftermarket parts distribution company operating in the United Kingdom. This acquisition served as our entry into the European automotive aftermarket business, from which we have expanded our European footprint through organic growth and subsequent acquisitions.


• | 2013 acquisition of Sator Beheer B.V. ("Sator"), a vehicle mechanical aftermarket parts distribution company based in the Netherlands, with operations in the Netherlands, Belgium and Northern France. This acquisition allowed us to further expand our geographic presence into continental Europe.


• | 2014 acquisition of Keystone Automotive Holdings, Inc. (“Keystone Specialty”), which expanded our product offering and increased our addressable market to include specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories.


• | 2016 acquisition of Rhiag-Inter Auto Parts Italia S.r.l. (“Rhiag”), a distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars and commercial vehicles in Italy, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Switzerland, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Poland and Spain. This acquisition expanded our geographic presence in continental Europe.


• | 2018 acquisition of Stahlgruber GmbH (“Stahlgruber”), a wholesale distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars, tools, capital equipment and accessories with operations in Germany, Austria, Italy, Slovenia, and Croatia with further sales to Switzerland. This acquisition expanded our geographic presence in continental Europe and serves as an additional strategic hub for our European operations.

Further information regarding our recent acquisitions is included in Note 2, "Business Combinations" to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

STRATEGY
Our mission is to be the leading global value-added distributor of vehicle parts and accessories by offering our customers the most comprehensive, available and cost-effective selection of part solutions while building strong partnerships with our employees and the communities in which we operate.
We have four primary pillars of a strategy to build economic value: growth through diversified product offerings; growth through geographic expansion; adaptation to evolving technology; and rationalization of our asset base to enhance margins and return on capital. We believe our supply network, with a broad inventory of quality alternative collision and mechanical repair products and specialty vehicle aftermarket products, high fulfillment rates, and superior customer service, provides us with a competitive advantage. To execute our strategy, we are focused on a number of key areas, including:

• | Extensive distribution network. We have invested significant capital to develop a network of alternative and specialty vehicle parts facilities across our operating segments. Additionally, our ability to move inventory throughout our distribution networks increases the availability of our products and helps us to fill a relatively high percentage of our customers’ requests. In order to expand our distribution network, we will continue to seek to enter new markets and to improve penetration through both organic development and acquisitions. We will continue to seek opportunities to leverage the distribution network by delivering more parts through our existing network. We believe our North America segment has the largest distribution network of alternative vehicle parts and accessories for the automotive collision repair market in North America. In our Europe segment, we are implementing a similar strategy to our North America operations by establishing a Pan-European distribution network. We currently have operations in 24 different European countries, which we believe represents the broadest and largest footprint in the aftermarket industry in Europe. On a global basis, we have approximately 1,700 locations as part of our distribution network.


• | Broad product offering. The breadth and depth of our inventory across all of our operating segments reinforces our ability to provide a “one-stop” solution for our customers’ alternative vehicle replacement, maintenance, and specialty vehicle product needs.


• | High fulfillment rates. We manage local inventory levels to improve delivery and maximize customer service. Improving local order fulfillment rates reduces transfer costs and delivery times, and improves customer satisfaction.


• | Strong business relationships. We have developed business relationships with key constituents, including customers, automobile insurance companies, suppliers and other industry participants in North America, Europe, and Asia.


• | Acquisitions. The primary objective of our acquisitions is to expand our presence to new or adjacent geographic markets and to expand into other product lines and businesses that may benefit from our operating strengths, in each case with the aim of increasing the size of our addressable market. When we identify potential acquisitions, we attempt to target companies with a leading market presence, an experienced management team and workforce that provide a fit with our existing operations, and strong cash flows. After completing an acquisition, we focus on integrating the company with our existing business to provide additional value to the combined entity through cost savings and synergies, such as logistics cost synergies resulting from integration with our existing distribution network, administrative cost savings, shared procurement, and cross-selling opportunities.


• | Technology driven business processes. We focus on technology development as a way to support our competitive advantage. We believe that we can more cost effectively leverage our data to make better business decisions than our smaller competitors.


• | Adaptation to evolving technology in the automotive industry. We are committed to monitoring and adapting our business to the technological changes in the automotive industry. We have recently established a strategy and innovation team that will help us to be more forward-looking and to assess the potential opportunities and risks associated with several areas including, but not limited to, e-commerce, accident avoidance systems, vehicle connectivity, autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles and ride-sharing trends.

NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT
Our North America segment is composed of wholesale operations, which consists of aftermarket and salvage operations, self service retail operations, and aviation operations.
Wholesale Operations
Inventory
Our wholesale operations in North America sell five product types (aftermarket, recycled, remanufactured, refurbished and, to a lesser extent, OEM parts) to professional collision and mechanical automobile repair businesses. Our principal aftermarket product types consist of those most frequently damaged in collisions, including bumper covers, automotive body 
6

panels, lights and automotive glass products such as windshields. Platinum Plus is our exclusive product line offered under the Keystone brand of aftermarket products. Certain of our products are certified by independent organizations such as the Certified Automotive Parts Association (“CAPA”) and NSF International (“NSF”). CAPA and NSF are associations that evaluate the quality of aftermarket collision replacement products compared to OEM collision replacement products. We also developed a product line called "Value Line" for more value conscious, often self-pay, consumers. Our salvage products include both mechanical and collision parts, including engines; transmissions; door assemblies; sheet metal products such as trunk lids, fenders and hoods; lights; and bumper assemblies.
The aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from independent manufacturers and distributors located primarily in North America and Asia, principally Taiwan. In 2018, approximately 39% of our aftermarket purchases were made from our top 4 vendors, with our largest vendor providing approximately 15% of our annual inventory purchases. We believe we are one of the largest customers of each of these suppliers. Outside of this group, no other supplier provided more than 5% of our supply of aftermarket products in 2018. We purchased approximately 47% of our aftermarket products in 2018 directly from manufacturers in Taiwan and other Asian countries. Approximately 50% of our aftermarket products were purchased from vendors located in the U.S.; however, we believe the majority of these products were manufactured in Taiwan, Mexico or other foreign countries.
Within our wholesale operations, we focus our procurement on products that are in the most demand, based on a number of factors such as historical sales records of vehicles by model and year, customer requests, and projections of future supply and demand trends. Because lead times may be 40 days or more on imported aftermarket products, sales volumes and in-stock inventory are important factors in the procurement process.
In our aftermarket operations, we use a third party enterprise management system and other third party software packages to leverage the centralized data and information that a single system provides, such as a data warehouse to conduct enhanced analytics and reporting, an integrated budgeting system, an electronic data interchange tool, and E-commerce tools to enhance our online business-to-business initiatives - OrderKeystone.com and Keyless.
We procure recycled products for our wholesale operations by acquiring total loss vehicles, typically sold at regional salvage auctions, and then dismantling and inventorying the parts. The availability and pricing of the salvage vehicles we procure for our wholesale recycled products operations may be impacted by a variety of factors, including the production level of new vehicles and the percentage of damaged vehicles declared total losses. Our bidding specialists are equipped with a proprietary software application that allows them to compare the vehicles at salvage auctions against our current inventory levels, historical demand, and recent average selling prices to arrive at an estimated maximum bid.
Our wholesale recycled product locations in North America operate an internally-developed, proprietary enterprise management system called LKQX. We believe that the use of a single system across all of our wholesale recycled product operations helps facilitate the sales process; allows for continued implementation of standard operating procedures; and yields improved training efficiency, employee transferability, access to our national inventory database, management reporting and data storage. The system also supports an electronic exchange process for identifying and locating parts at other select recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock.
Scrap and Other Materials
Our salvage operations generate scrap metal and other materials that we sell to metals recyclers. Vehicles that have been dismantled for recycled products and "crush only" end-of-life vehicles acquired from other companies are typically crushed using equipment on site. In other cases, we will hire mobile crushing equipment to crush the vehicles before they are transported to shredders and scrap metal processors. Damaged and unusable wheel cores are melted in our aluminum furnace and sold to consumers of aluminum ingot and sow for the production of various automotive products, including wheels. We also extract and sell the precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts such as catalytic converters.
Customers
We sell our products to wholesale customers that include collision and mechanical repair shops and new and used car dealerships, as well as to retail customers. The majority of these customers tend to be individually-owned small businesses, although the number of independent and dealer-operated collision repair facilities has declined over the last decade, as regional or national multiple-location operators have increased their geographic presence through consolidation.
Automobile insurance companies affect the demand for our collision products; while insurance companies do not pay for our products directly, they ultimately pay for the repair costs of insured vehicles in excess of any deductible amount. As a result, insurance companies often influence the types of products used in a repair. The use of our products instead of OEM products provides a direct benefit to insurance companies by lowering the cost of repairs, decreasing the time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer, and providing a replacement product that is of high quality and comparable performance to the part replaced.
7

Our sales personnel are encouraged to promote LKQ to customers as a “one-stop shop” by offering comparable options from our other product lines if the desired part is not in stock. To support these efforts, we have provided our sales staff with access to both recycled and aftermarket sales systems to encourage cross selling.
To better serve our customers, we take a consolidated approach to the electronic sale of wholesale products in our North America segment. A full suite of e-commerce services is available to approved partners that helps us improve order accuracy, reduce return rate and better fit our customer workflow. Using these services in coordination with our partners, products can be searched, priced and ordered without leaving the customers' own operating systems.
Distribution
We have a distribution network of warehouses and cross dock facilities, which allows us to develop and maintain our service levels with local repair shops while providing fulfillment rates that are made possible by our nationwide presence. Our delivery fleet utilizes a third party software provider to optimize delivery routes, and to track the progress of delivery vehicles throughout their runs. Our local presence allows us to provide daily deliveries as required by our customers, using drivers who routinely deliver to the same customers. Our sales force and local delivery drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with the local repair shops that benefit from access to our wide selection of products, which we are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network. We operate a delivery fleet of medium-sized trucks and smaller trucks and vans, which deliver multiple product types on the same delivery routes to help minimize distribution costs and improve customer service.
Competition
We consider all suppliers of vehicle collision and mechanical products to be competitors, including aftermarket suppliers, recycling businesses, refurbishing operations, parts remanufacturers, OEMs and internet-based suppliers. We compete with alternative parts distributors on the basis of our nationwide distribution system, our product lines and inventory availability, customer service, our relationships with insurance companies, and to a lesser extent, price; we compete with OEMs primarily on the basis of price and, to a lesser extent, on service and product quality. We do not consider retail chains that focus on the do-it-yourself market to be our direct competitors since many of our wholesale product sales are influenced by insurance companies, who ultimately pay for the repair costs of insured vehicles in excess of any deductible amount, rather than the end user, and there is limited overlap in the products that we sell.
Self Service Operations
Our self service retail operations, most of which operate under the name “LKQ Pick Your Part,” allow consumers to come directly to the yard to pick parts off of salvage vehicles. In addition to revenue from the sale of parts, core, and scrap, we charge a nominal admission fee to access the property.
Inventory
We acquire inventory for our self service retail product operations from a variety of sources, including but not limited to towing companies, vehicle auctions, the general public, municipality sales, insurance carriers, and charitable organizations. We typically procure salvage vehicles for our self service retail product operations that are generally older and of lower price than the salvage vehicles we purchase for our wholesale recycled product operations. Vehicles are delivered to our locations by the seller, or we arrange for transportation. Once on our property, minimal labor is required to process the vehicle other than removing the battery, fluids, refrigerants, catalytic converters and hazardous materials. The extracted fluids are stored in bulk and subsequently sold to recyclers. Vehicles are then placed in the yard for customers to remove parts. In our self service business, availability of a specific part will depend on which vehicles are currently at the site and to what extent parts may have been previously sold. We usually keep a vehicle at our facility for 30 to 120 days, depending on the capacity of the yard and size of the market, before it is crushed and sold to scrap metal processors.
Scrap and Other Materials
Our self service operations generate scrap metal, alloys and other materials that we sell to recyclers. Vehicles that we no longer make available to the public and "crush only" vehicles acquired from other companies, including OEMs, are typically crushed using equipment on site. Damaged and unusable wheel cores are melted in our aluminum furnace and sold to consumers of aluminum ingot and sow for the production of various automotive products, including wheels. We also extract and sell the precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts such as catalytic converters.
Customers
The customers of our self service yards are frequently do-it-yourself mechanics, small independent repair shops servicing older vehicles, auto rebuilders, and resellers. The scrap from the vehicle hulks, when not processed by us, is sold to metals recyclers, with whom we may also compete when procuring salvage vehicles for our operations.
8

Competition
There are competitors operating self service businesses in all of the markets in which we operate. In some markets, there are numerous competitors, often operating in close proximity to our operations. We try to differentiate our business by the quality of the inventory and the size and cleanliness of the property. We also differentiate our business from our competitors through our app, which allows customers to receive daily push notifications when cars they are interested in are placed into their favorite yards. In addition to allowing customers to see our available inventory, the app also allows customers to input search parameters such as the specific part they are searching for, and the year, make, and model of the vehicle, in an effort to expand the number of cars that might be available to pull parts from. We do not consider retail chains that focus on the do-it-yourself market to be our direct competitors, as there is limited overlap in the products that we sell. 
Aviation Operations
Our aviation operations specialize in the sale of recycled aviation parts, including aircraft structural components and spare parts, complete engines, engine components, and whole airplanes to regional Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul providers, aircraft operators, fixed-base operators, corporate customers, and other aviation dealers and distributors around the globe. Our aviation business is located in the U.S., with sales representation in Mexico and the U.K. Our aviation business comprises approximately 1% of our North America segment revenue.
EUROPE SEGMENT
Our Europe segment was built on four key acquisitions: ECP (2011), Sator (2013), Rhiag (2016) and Stahlgruber (2018). Additionally, in 2014 we expanded our European segment to include wholesale recycling operations through our acquisition of a business with salvage and vehicle repair facilities in Sweden and Norway, and in 2016, we acquired an equity investment in Mekonomen AB ("Mekonomen"), the leading independent car parts and service chain in the Nordic region of Europe. Mekonomen is independent of our existing European operations, but we are exploring areas where the companies can work together in a mutually beneficial manner, primarily related to procurement. Our European strategy is to target platform acquisitions to cover broad markets initially, then integrate these businesses with our other operations and subsequently expand our footprint in these regions through new branch openings and smaller tuck-in acquisitions with the goal of eventually attaining continent-wide coverage. Our acquisitions provide a platform to capitalize on the large and fragmented aftermarket mechanical replacement parts market in Europe, and allow for potential cost savings from the leveraging of our combined purchasing power given the significant overlap in suppliers and product mix. We have acquired many smaller businesses within the regions we operate and over time, we anticipate further integration of our European operations as we optimize purchasing, warehousing, cataloging, logistics and back-office functions, and align our private label brands across the segment.
Inventory
Our inventory is primarily composed of mechanical aftermarket parts for the repair of vehicles 3 to 15 years old. Our top selling products include brake pads, discs and sensors, clutches, electrical products such as spark plugs and batteries, steering and suspension products, filters, and oil and automotive fluids. In addition to mechanical aftermarket parts, we also sell collision parts in our Europe segment, although these sales represent less than 2% of total Europe segment revenue. 
In 2018, our top two suppliers represented 12% of our aftermarket inventory purchases, with our top supplier representing approximately 7% of our purchases. No other suppliers comprised more than 5% of our purchases during 2018. The aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from vendors located primarily in the U.K. and continental Europe. In 2018, we purchased 93% of our products from companies in Europe. The remaining 7% of our 2018 purchases were sourced from vendors located primarily in China or Taiwan, some of which also supply collision parts for our Wholesale - North America operations. In 2018, 66%, 22%, 6%, and 3% of our total inventory purchases were made in Euros, Pounds Sterling, U.S. Dollars and Czech Koruna, respectively.
Our aftermarket operations in Europe use various information technology (“IT”) systems. Our systems are complex, and are designed to do a variety of tasks (depending on the market), including: manage customer orders and inventory movement, optimize our warehouse and logistics, and financial reporting. Certain of our IT systems can interface with our repair shop customers' respective IT systems, which enables them to identify the part required for the repair. In 2018, as part of our strategy to create an integrated European company, we initiated a multi-year program to develop a European wide ERP system, which will reduce the number of IT systems we operate.
In our Nordic operations, we purchase severely damaged or totaled vehicles from insurance companies, which are transferred to our dismantling facilities or sold to other third party dismantlers.
Customers
We primarily operate a two-step (i.e. direct sales to customers) distribution model in Europe, although certain of our operations, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, and Hungary, operate wholly or partially a three-step (i.e. 
9

sales to distributors who in turn sell to customers) distribution model. In our two-step operations, we sell the majority of our products to commercial customers primarily consisting of professional repairers, including both independent mechanical repair shops and collision repair shops. In our three-step operations, we sell products to wholesale distributors or jobbers. In addition to our sales to repair shops and wholesale distributors, we generate a portion of our revenue through sales to retail customers from e-commerce platforms and from counter sales at the branch locations.
Distribution
Our European operations employ a distribution model in which inventory is stored at national or international distribution centers or regional hubs, with fast moving product stored at branch locations (where we operate a two-step distribution model). The large distribution centers regularly re-stock the smaller branches and hubs and hold slower moving items allowing us high fulfillment rates. Product is moved through the distribution network on our vans or via common carrier. 
 Competition
We view all suppliers of replacement repair products as our competitors, including other alternative parts suppliers and OEMs and their dealer networks. We face significant competition in many markets where even smaller competitors can compete on price and service and the OEM’s compete via ties to, and brand loyalty of, the consumer while also remaining competitive on price, service and availability. We believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other alternative parts suppliers primarily through our distribution network, efficient stock management systems and proprietary technology, which allows us to deliver our products quickly, as well as through our product lines and inventory availability, pricing, and service.
SPECIALTY SEGMENT
Our Specialty operating segment was formed in 2014 with our acquisition of Keystone Specialty, a leading distributor and marketer of specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories in North America. Our Specialty operations reach most major markets in the U.S. and Canada and serve the following six product segments: RV; truck and off-road; towing; speed and performance; wheels, tires and performance handling; and miscellaneous accessories. In 2017, we acquired Warn Industries, Inc. ("Warn"), a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of high performance vehicle equipment and accessories. The acquisition of Warn expanded our presence in the specialty market and creates viable points of entry into related markets.
Inventory
The specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories we distribute and raw materials for products we manufacture are purchased from suppliers located primarily in the U.S., Canada, and China. Our top selling products are RV appliances & air conditioners, towing hitches, truck bed covers, vehicle protection products, cargo management products, and wheels, tires & suspension products. Specialty aftermarket suppliers are typically small to medium-sized, independent businesses that focus on a narrow product or market niche. Due to the highly fragmented supplier base for specialty vehicle aftermarket products, we have limited supplier concentration. In 2018, approximately 14% of our specialty vehicle aftermarket purchases were made from our top two suppliers, with our largest supplier providing approximately 9% of our annual inventory purchases. No other suppliers comprised more than 5% of our purchases during 2018. With our 2017 acquisition of Warn, we have internal manufacturing capabilities to source aftermarket winches, hoists, and bumpers.
Most of our Specialty operations utilize an internally developed inventory management and order entry system that interfaces with third party software systems for accounting, transaction processing, data analytics, and reporting.
Customers
Overall, the specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and accessories market serves a fragmented customer base composed of RV and specialty automotive dealers, installers, jobbers, builders, parts chains, and mail-order businesses. Our customers are principally small, independent businesses. These customers depend on us to provide a broad range of products, rapid delivery, marketing support and technical assistance. In addition to traditional customers, in recent years we have increased sales to several large parts and accessory online retailers. Our Specialty segment also operates retail stores in northeast Pennsylvania.
We promote our products to customers through marketing programs, which include: (i) catalogs, advertising, sponsorships and promotional activities, (ii) product level marketing and merchandising support, and (iii) online and digital marketing initiatives. Our national footprint allows us to stage trade shows across the U.S., which provide an opportunity to improve sales through the showcasing of new and innovative products from our vendors to our customers.
Online sales of our Specialty products take place primarily through our ekeystone.com and viantp.com sites and mobile app. These sites provide customers (i) the ability to match products with the make and model of vehicle thus allowing the customer to order the right part, (ii) product information (e.g. pictures, attributes) available for review and (iii) the convenience of searching inventory availability and ordering the product on the site. Additionally, the site can provide sales opportunities by suggesting other parts to purchase based on an inquiry submitted by the customer.
10

Distribution
Our Specialty segment operations employ a hub-and-spoke distribution model which enables us to transport products from our primary distribution centers to our non-inventory stocking cross docks, a majority of which are co-located with our North America wholesale operations and provide distribution points to key regional markets and synergies with our existing infrastructure. We believe this provides added value to our customers through a broader product offering and more efficient distribution process. We use our delivery routes to provide delivery and returns of our products directly to and from our customers in all 48 continental U.S. states and 9 Canadian provinces, and we ship globally to customers in other countries. Our delivery fleet utilizes a third party software provider to optimize delivery routes, and to track the progress of delivery vehicles throughout their runs.
Competition
Industry participants have a variety of supply choices. Vendors can deliver products to market via warehouse distributors and mail order catalog businesses, or directly to retailers and/or consumers. We view all suppliers of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories as our competitors. We believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and equipment suppliers primarily through our broad product selection, which encompasses both popular and hard-to-find products, our national distribution network, and efficient inventory management systems, as well as through our service. We compete on the basis of product breadth and depth, rapid and dependable delivery, marketing initiatives, support services, and price.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We own and have the right to use various intellectual property, including intellectual property acquired as a result of past acquisitions. In addition to trade names, trademarks and patents, we also have technology-based intellectual property that has been both internally developed and obtained through license agreements and acquisitions. We do not believe that our business is materially dependent on any single item of intellectual property, or any single group of related intellectual property, owned or licensed, nor would the expiration of any particular item or related group of intellectual property, or the termination of any particular intellectual property license agreement materially affect our business.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 51,000 persons, of which approximately 22,500 were employed in North America and approximately 28,500 were employed outside of North America. Of our employees in North America, approximately 1,200 were represented by unions. Outside of North America, we have government-mandated collective bargaining agreements and union contracts in certain countries, particularly in Europe where many of our employees are represented by unions and/or works councils. We consider our employee relations to be good.
FACILITIES
As of December 31, 2018, our operations included approximately 1,700 facilities, most of which are leased. Of our total facilities, approximately 550 facilities were located in the U.S. and approximately 1,150 facilities were located in 24 other countries. Many of our locations stock multiple product types or serve more than one function.
Our global headquarters are located at 500 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois 60661. Our North American headquarters, in Nashville, Tennessee, performs certain centralized functions for our North American operations, including accounting, procurement, and information systems support. In 2018, we expanded the size of our North American headquarters via construction of a new 100,000 square foot facility in Nashville. Our European operations are distributed throughout Europe with some main offices in Tamworth, England; in Schiedam, and Amsterdam, the Netherlands; in Milan, Italy; in Prague, Czech Republic; and in Poing, Germany. In addition to these offices, we have two national distribution centers in Tamworth totaling 1,000,000 and 500,000 square feet, respectively, which house inventory to supply the hubs and branches of our U.K. and Republic of Ireland operations, and one international distribution center in Sulzbach-Rosenberg, Germany which supplies our recently acquired Stahlgruber’s operations in Germany, Austria, Italy, Slovenia and Croatia. Our Specialty operations maintain primary procurement, accounting and finance functions in Exeter, Pennsylvania. Certain back-office support functions for our segments are performed in Bangalore, India. Additionally, we operate an aftermarket parts warehouse in Taiwan to aggregate inventory for shipment to our locations in North America.
REGULATION
Our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment in the U.S. and the other countries in which we operate. See the risk factor “We are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding the effects of environmental laws and regulations on us.
11

We may be affected by tariffs and other import laws and restrictions because we import into the U.S. a significant number of products for sale and distribution. See the risk factors “If significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on products or materials we import or any related counter-measures are taken by countries to which we export products, our revenue and results of operations may be materially harmed” and “Intellectual property claims relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business” in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding importation risks.
              Our business processes and operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection. See the risk factor “The costs of complying with the requirements of laws pertaining to the privacy and security of personal information and the potential liability associated with the failure to comply with such laws could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations” in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information about privacy and data protection risks.
              Some jurisdictions have enacted laws to restrict or prohibit the sale of alternative vehicle parts. See the risk factor “Existing or new laws and regulations may prohibit, restrict or burden the sale of aftermarket, recycled, refurbished or remanufactured products” in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information concerning regulatory restrictions on the sale of our products.
              We have thousands of employees located in the U.S. and many other countries and are subject to labor and employment laws in numerous jurisdictions. See the risk factor “Our business may be adversely affected by union activities and labor and employment laws” in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these labor and employment risks.
SEASONALITY
Our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors, influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns. During the winter months, we tend to have higher demand for our vehicle replacement products because there are more weather related repairs. Our specialty vehicle operations typically generate greater revenue and earnings in the second quarter, when vehicle owners tend to install this equipment, and lower revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter, when the number of RV trips tends to decline as a result of the winter weather. Our aftermarket glass operations typically generate greater revenue and earnings in the second and third quarters, when the demand for automotive replacement glass increases after the winter weather.
