Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 
Graham Corporation ("we," "us," "our") is a global business that designs, manufactures and sells critical equipment for the energy, defense and chemical/petrochemical industries.  Our energy markets include oil refining, cogeneration, and alternative power.  For the defense industry, our equipment is used in nuclear propulsion power systems for the U.S. Navy. For the chemical and petrochemical industries, our equipment is used in fertilizer, ethylene, methanol and downstream chemical facilities. Graham’s global brand is built upon our world-renowned engineering expertise in vacuum and heat transfer technology, responsive and flexible customer service and high quality standards.  We design and manufacture custom-engineered ejectors, vacuum pumping systems, surface condensers and vacuum systems.  Our equipment can also be found in other diverse applications such as metal refining, pulp and paper processing, water heating, refrigeration, desalination, food processing, pharmaceutical, heating, ventilating and air conditioning.
 
Our corporate headquarters are located in Batavia, New York.  We have production facilities located with our headquarters in Batavia.  We also have a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary, Graham Vacuum and Heat Transfer Technology (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. ("GVHTT"), located in Suzhou, China.  GVHTT provides sales and engineering support for us in the People’s Republic of China and management oversight throughout Southeast Asia.  In the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018, we established Graham India Private Limited ("GIPL") as a wholly-owned subsidiary.  GIPL, located in Ahmedabad, India, serves as a sales and market development office focusing on the refining, petrochemical and fertilizer markets.
 
We were incorporated in Delaware in 1983 and are the successor to Graham Manufacturing Co., Inc., which was incorporated in New York in 1936.  Our stock is traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "GHM".  
 
Unless indicated otherwise, dollar figures in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are reported in thousands. 
 Business for Sale
 Due to the changes in the commercial nuclear utility industry over the last several years and the subsequent decline in performance of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Energy Steel & Supply Co. ("Energy Steel"), located in Lapeer, Michigan, we have decided the business is better suited for another partner and have elected to divest of it.  We are in discussions to sell the business.  Subsequent to March 31, 2019, we received an offer for the purchase of Energy Steel.  During fiscal 2019, Energy Steel had $8,336 in net sales.

Our principal customers include end users of our products in their manufacturing, refining and power generation processes, large engineering companies that build installations for companies in such industries, and the original equipment manufacturers who combine our products with their equipment prior to its sale to end users.  
 
Our products are sold by a team of sales engineers we employ directly as well as by independent sales representatives located worldwide.  There may be short periods of time, a fiscal year for example, where one customer may make up greater than 10% of our business.  However, if this occurs in multiple years, it is usually not the same customer or project over such a multi-year period.  One customer did account for greater than 10% of our business in fiscal 2019.  
 
As a result of our diversification efforts to more extensively support the U.S. Navy, we have increased our domestic sales in 2019.  Over a business cycle, our domestic sales will generally range between 50% and 75% of total sales.  The mix of domestic and international sales can vary from year to year.  
 
Our backlog at March 31, 2019 was $132,127 compared with $117,946 at March 31, 2018.  Excluding backlog associated with assets and liabilities held for sale, backlog on March 31, 2019 was $124,088.
 Our Strengths
 
Our core strengths include:
  
• | We have a value-enhancing sales and development platform. We believe our customer-facing platform of sales, project estimating and application engineering are competitive advantages. We have tools and capabilities that we believe allow us to move quickly and comprehensively as customers evaluate how best to integrate our equipment into their facilities. We believe that our early and deep involvement adds significant value to the process and is an important competitive differentiator in the long sales cycle industries we serve. We believe customers need our engineering and fabrication expertise early in the project life cycle to understand how best to specify our equipment. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are renowned for our strong capabilities to handle complex, custom orders. The orders we receive are extremely complex and we believe that the order management platforms in our businesses provide a second competitive differentiator for our company. Typically there is intense interaction between our project management teams and the end user or its engineering firm as product design and quality requirements are finalized after an order is placed. We have built strong capabilities which we believe allows us to successfully execute high quality, engineered-to-order and build-to-spec process-critical equipment. In our markets, we believe that order administration, risk management, cost containment, quality and engineering documentation are as important as the equipment itself. The supplier selection process begins with assessing whether a supplier can manage all aspects of an order. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We maintain a responsive, flexible production environment. We believe our operations platform is adept at handling low volume, high mix orders that are highly customized fabrications. We also believe that our production environment is much different from a highly engineered standard products business. While certain equipment in a product group may look similar, there are often subtle differences which are required to deliver the desired specification. Also, during production it is not uncommon for customer-driven engineering changes to occur that alter the configuration of what had been initially released into production. The markets that we serve demand this flexible operating model. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We provide robust after-the-sale technical support. Our engineering and service personnel go to customer sites to audit the performance of our equipment, provide operator training and troubleshoot performance issues. Technical service after a sale is important to our customer as we believe their focus is always on leveraging our equipment to maximize its capabilities. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have a highly trained workforce. We maintain a long-tenured, highly skilled and extremely flexible workforce. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | We have a strong balance sheet. We maintain significant cash and investments on hand, and no bank debt, which we believe provides us with the flexibility to pursue our business strategy, including growth by acquisition.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have a high-quality credit facility. Our credit facilities provide us with a $30,000 borrowing capacity that is expandable at our option to provide us with up to a total of $55,000 in borrowing capacity. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
