Loan to 0731380 B.C. Limited
 
On December 1, 2018, AllyMe Holding Inc. (“AllyMe”) entered into an agreement to acquire a 51% interest in 0731380 B.C. Limited, a company registered in British Columbia, Canada (“0731380”). Initially, this transaction was structured as a purchase of equity by AllyMe, however, the parties thereafter agreed (effective ab initio) that the transaction be structured as a convertible loan rather than an equity purchase transaction.
 
The restructuring of the initial Agreement and the amendment thereof on February 28, 2019 was approved by the Boards of Directors of both AllyMe and 0731380. This is a related-party transaction as Chunxia Jiang is the principal and controlling shareholder and the sole director of both AllyMe and 0731380.
 
Therefore, the parties have agreed that, in lieu of any purchase of an equity interest in 0731380, AllyMe would advance a loan to 0731380 in the initial face amount of $150,000 (the “Loan”), which will be payable One (1) year following the advance of funding of the Loan. 0731380 will use the proceeds of the Loan to fund the acquisition of a license and development of a retail outlet for the sale of cannabis-related products by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Natural Recreation in Kitimat, BC, Canada. The loan bears interest at a rate of five percent (5%) per annum payable at Maturity. The Loan Agreement (“Loan Agreement”) provides that if all licenses required to operate the retail store in Kitimat are issued by an agreed date, the Loan may be converted, at the option of AllyMe, into an equity investment in Natural Recreation. There is a further provision in the Loan Agreement that if the Loan is converted, AllyMe may, at its sole option, additionally issue 3,060,000 shares of its common stock to 0731380 which, together with the conversion of the Loan, will be AllyMe’s purchase price for a 51% interest in Natural Recreation. If full licensure for the retail store in Kitimat is not issued by the agreed date, then the loan will convert to a term loan to be repaid on a schedule mutually agreed by the parties. There is no penalty for the early payment of the Loan. As of this date, such licensure is only in the early application process and there is no guarantee when any license will be issued, if at all.

Risks and Uncertainties facing the Company
 
The Company has had only limited revenues which have been derived from its consulting agreements. Notwithstanding, the Company expects to generate revenues from both the advisory agreements and its initial retail marijuana outlet.
 
As an early-stage company, the Company expects to experience losses in the near term. The Company needs to generate revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to identify sufficient numbers of customers or build its retail marijuana outlet to generate enough revenues to continue operations or proceed with developing its business in accordance with its business plan.
 
One of the biggest challenges facing the Company will be in securing adequate capital to fund its projects, including securing adequate capital to pay for operations and hiring service providers. Secondarily, a major challenge will be implementing effective sales and marketing strategies to reach the intended end customers. The Company has considered and devised its initial sales, marketing and advertising strategy; however, the Company will need to skillfully implement this strategy in order to achieve success in its business.
 
Due to these and other factors, the Company’s need for additional capital, the Company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
 
Competition 
 
The Company encounters substantial competition from a wide variety of entities in both of its business lines, most of which is from companies which are better capitalized than the Company. Many of these entities will have significantly greater experience, resources and managerial capabilities than the Company and will therefore be in a better position than the Company to obtain access to attractive business opportunities. 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no employees.
