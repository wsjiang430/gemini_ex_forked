Item 1. Business
 
As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Report"), references to the "Company," the "registrant," "we," "our" or "us" refer to Cool Technologies, Inc. and our 95% owned subsidiary, Ultimate Power Truck, LLC ("UPT"), unless the context otherwise indicates.
 
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated on July 22, 2002 in the State of Nevada under the name Bibb Corporation. On September 3, 2010, we changed our name to Z3 Enterprises, Inc. ("Z3"), and on April 5, 2012, to HPEV, Inc. ("HPEV") and on August 19, 2015 our stockholders voted to approve a name change to Cool Technologies, Inc. Our 95% owned subsidiary, Ultimate Power Truck, LLC ("UPT"), was formed on April 17, 2014 in the State of Florida.
 
On March 29, 2011, we entered into a share exchange agreement (which was amended on June 14, 2011) with HPEV, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("the Share Exchange Agreement") to acquire 100 shares, constituting all of the issued and outstanding shares of HPEV, Inc. in consideration for the issuance of 22,000,000 shares of common stock. Upon closing of the share exchange on April 15, 2011, HPEV, Inc. became our wholly owned subsidiary. There was a change of control of our company on April 15, 2011 as a result of the issuance of 21,880,000 shares of our common stock to the original shareholders of HPEV, Inc. pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement. An additional 120,000 shares were issued during the fourth quarter of 2011 which completed the issuance of 22,000,000 shares of common stock under the terms of the amended Share Exchange Agreement. 
 
We filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada increasing our authorized shares of common stock, from 140,000,000 shares to 350,000,000 shares, effective March 22, 2017. 
 
As of April 1, 2019, we have seven US patents, one Mexican patent and five pending applications (2 in Canada, 1 in Brazil, 2 US) covering composite heat structures, motors, and related structures, heat pipe architecture, applications (commonly referred to as "thermal" or "heat dispersion technology") and a parallel power vehicle platform system. We also have one Patent Cooperation Treaty ("PCT") application pending that covers integrated electrical power generation methods and systems.
 
The Company intends to sell a mobile electric power system powered by the Company's proprietary gearing system to commercial vehicle and fleet owners. It intends to commercialize its patents by licensing its thermal technologies and applications to electric motor, pump and vehicle component manufacturers. It may license its mobile electric power system as well. 
 
Business Description 
 
Cool Technologies has spent years designing and developing its technologies. The core technologies are:
 
Thermal Dispersion - patented technologies (totally enclosed heat pipe cooled and radial vent) that deliver liquid-cooled results for rotating equipment, multi-plate clutches, brakes and rotors without the use of liquid. Liquid cooling is the best, most effective cooling system for electric motors, however, it is also the most expensive. Our technologies reduce the cost of rotating equipment by eliminating the active material and, otherwise, extra components that liquid cooling requires. Our technologies also reduce production costs by increasing the power densities of the rotating equipment which enables them to output the same power from a smaller package. 
 
Mobile Power Generation -- a patented and patents pending in-chassis system that outputs electrical power in amounts equal to or greater than skid-mounted generators or tow-behind generators from a smaller, lighter, more efficient package.

The markets for products utilizing our technology include consumer, industrial and military markets, both in the U.S. and worldwide. Our initial target markets include those involved in moving materials and moving people, such as:
 

· | Motors/Generators, 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Mobile auxiliary power, 
· | Compressors, 
· | Turbines (Wind, Micro), 
· | Bearings, 
· | Electric Vehicles: rail, off-highway, mining, delivery, refuse, 
· | Brakes/rotors/calipers, 
· | Pumps/fans, 
· | Passenger vehicles: autos, RVs, buses, trains, aircraft, 
· | Commercial vehicles: SUV, light trucks, trams, bucket trucks 
· | Military: boats, Humvees, trucks, aircraft, and 
· | Marine: boats ranging in size from 30 feet to 120 feet and beyond.

Our Technologies
 
Our technologies are divided into two distinct but complementary categories: heat dispersion technology and mobile power generation (MG).
 
Totally Enclosed Heat Pipe and Radial Vent Heat Pipe
 
The Company has developed, designed, manufactured and third party tested Totally Enclosed Heat Pipe Cooled (TEHPC) designs. It also owns the patents on the designs. The designs apply to drypit submersible motors and 
 650kVA marine duty generators. 
 
Our patent portfolio covers the application and integration of our heat pipes into various other cooling schemes for enhanced heat removal in motors (i.e. electric motorcycles, cars and trucks), generators (i.e. e-axles and the MG system) and numerous other industrial applications including multi-clutches for vehicles and brakes and rotors for vehicles marine, aviation and military. We believe that our technologies have the potential to deliver power output increases and cost reductions, depending on the machine type or motor/generator size, as follows:
 

1. | Increase power density of current motor platforms by 20% to 40%,
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Reduce total product cost by 12.5% to 25%, 
3. | Increase motor and generator efficiency by 1% to 2%, and 
4. | Increase motor and generator life. 

 
We also believe that products produced with our technologies have the potential to deliver operational savings as well, including savings from:
 

- | reduced maintenance costs, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | the standardization of multiple platforms down to a single platform, 
- | the standardization of drawings and data around existing platforms, 
- | the ability to use standard designs and standard insulation systems versus customization, and 
- | the ability to integrate and produce on existing production lines with no retooling and no additional, or minimal, capital investment.

 
Testing conducted by independent laboratories showed a 200% increase in horsepower capability for a dry pit submersible pump and a 25 to 35% increase in power density for a 650 kVA generator. 
 
Our revenue model for the heat dispersion technology is to license the technology in exchange for royalties. Our design and manufacturing experience will be put to use by taking current product in the market, retrofitting with our TEHPC and radial vent heat pipes and handing back to the OEM a third party tested and validated, manufacturable product that increases performance and lowers cost. 
 

5

 
The electric motorcycle industry which includes brands such as Harley Davidson, Zero and others, relies on both air- cooled and liquid-cooled motors. We believe our technology can result in the production of smaller, lighter weight motors as well as cooler motors, batteries and controls. We believe it will also address common performance issues such as overheating which shuts down the motor and forces the rider to stop and let the motor cool. 
 

Thermal Technology Target Markets: Generators
---------------------------------------------
Large kilowatt: | prime power 
Stationary: | emergency back-up, UPS systems 
Commercial Mobile: | Electric vehicles and motor- cycles, e-axles, battery management systems
Consumer: | home standby, recreation 
Rental: | mobile + light towers, pumps, compressors 

Mobile Power Generation (MG)
 
The Company has a patent pending gearing system, which is used to power an in-chassis generator, eliminating the need for some commercial vehicles to tow a mobile generator to a work site. Management believes that there is a need for on-board, continuous generation of up to 350 to 400 kilowatts (kW) of power to remote jobsites, charge electric vehicles and generate emergency power in the event of an outage or disaster. Recent meetings with Mexican farmers, military personnel and electric vehicle companies have validated the need for such applications. We offer an in-chassis generator installation kit as a stand-alone (Mobile Generator or MG) for third parties and may create an in-house brand (Ultimate Work Truck) with the system installed.
 
Management, along with key directors and members of the Board of Advisors utilized 2018 to establish production centers, expand business relationships in the USA, Mexico, the Middle East and Australia. The Company also signed supplier agreements and purchase components, joined industry trade associations and generated 10 purchase orders to go with the 269 sales commitments which previously confirmed revenues for the Company. They also increased electrical output for the MG, added new technical capabilities (such as enabling it to output both single and three phase power simultaneously from the Company’s planned no-idle system), updated software, finalized data packs, models and schematics to enable third party up-fitting, and defined the steps of the purchase cycle with our manufacturing partner, Craftsmen Industries. We also launched our MG30-MG125 products in the first quarter of 2019. First article build-to-print is currently underway and will be completed in Q2 of 2019, enabling our pre-production and production runs to start in Q2 and ramp up in Q3.
 
In May 2018 we demonstrated an MG80 mobile electric power system in Fort Collins, Colorado before Mexican representatives from a variety of government and industry sectors generated interest for several applications in the country including water purification and deep well pumping. 
 
A review of a first run MG80 production vehicle was held at Craftsmen Industries in St. Louis on March 27th, 2019.
 
Our revenue model for an in-chassis mobile electric power generation system is driven by the efforts of partner up-fitters and truck body builders along with regional sales teams and independent representatives as well as potential strategic alliances and joint ventures. 
 
We believe that in head-to-head competition with tow behind generators, our mobile generation technology should prove very disruptive. Operators in such markets as the military, utilities and agriculture, to name a few, will be able to work in remote locations without having to tow or drop in a generator. We believe that the reduction in overall weight and size should also deliver significant operating efficiencies and savings to government and work truck fleets.

Truck mounted electric vehicle charging systems provide a distinctive way for electric vehicle manufacturers to separate themselves from the competition and a way to help address the financial needs of their smaller market dealers: Mobile charging vehicles don’t require permits or build out of infrastructure which, depending on the type of charging required can cost $300,000 to $400,000 per dealer (http://electrek.co/2018/10/16/porsche-taycan-dealers-charging-stations/). Our technology can provide Level 2 and DC Fast Charging (up to and including 350 kVA on a Class 7 13 liter) and deliver even more power in the future. That’s because the system is retrofittable. It can be uninstalled and reinstalled on a larger truck that generates more torque. 
 
For small market dealers, the truck can act as an interim solution to postpone or minimize the installation costs until sales justify expenditures. In fact, the Company intends to make acquisition easier by offering vehicle leasing through our network of truck up-fitters.
 
Mobile charging can also be offered as a service to new vehicle owners on a complementary or service contract basis. If a home charger fails or a vehicle gets stuck on the road the owner is covered, the dealer can send out a truck.
 
The mobile electric vehicle charging trucks could also be branded as a service of the charging networks growing along transportation corridors around the world and the cost shared among their members. 
 
Cool Technologies can integrate water purification and desalination units with the MG to offer water treatment as well as delivery if a rolling tank is hitched to the truck. The truck-mounted systems cleanse contaminated, polluted and waste water or remove saline from saltwater to produce 2,500 to 20,000 gallons of water per day. The desalination unit can output either clean potable water for drinking and cooking or non-potable water for agricultural use. 
 
Both disaster relief agencies and agricultural entities can benefit. In disaster areas, four-wheel drive vehicles can traverse downed trees ,blocked roads and forbidding terrains to bring aid quickly to those in need. Whereas, in farming regions throughout the world, industrial pollution has affected the aquifers and other water sources. In coastal areas, excessive pumping has led to saltwater intrusion in the aquifers. 
 
Cool Technologies offers our patent-pending no-idle option that enables the MG system to operate solely through battery and solar power without the need to idle the truck’s engine. An MG outfitted with a solar or battery-powered no idle system could output clean drinkable water for virtually no cost.
 
Competition 
 
Heat Dispersion Technologies (Totally Enclosed Heat Pipe Cooled and Radial Vent Heat Pipe) 
 
Cooling solutions to remove or control heat produced by industrial electric motors, generators and alternators are provided by the manufacturers. Their current best practices are based on technology that's over 50 years old. They either add a liquid cooling system to the motor or build an extra large frame around the motor to provide additional surface area to help dissipate the heat. Both practices increase the cost and complexity of their products. 
 
The Company is not aware of any new alternatives on the market.
 
Mobile Electric Power (MG30-MG200)

Management believes that the Company can compete in the mobile electric power market because there is a need for in-chassis generators, as opposed to trailer-mounted generators towed behind a vehicle. A primary benefit is that the in-chassis installation enables a truck to tow other trailers and equipment, however, we believe the greatest selling point is value. In comparison to the purchase price of a new Doosan towable generator, we can provide up to 200 kilowatts ("kW") of auxiliary mobile power to any location for less than half the production cost of a towable, trailer-mounted generator, which may weigh over 10,000 pounds. We deliver the same power at under 3,000 pounds. Our Mobile Generation system also offers the same features of a tow behind generator including single and three phase outputs as well as a full function generator panel with enhanced capabilities including a touchscreen, digital controls and optional telematics. 

7

 
We believe our competition in the mobile generator market will be from well-established companies such as Cummins, Caterpillar Inc. (“Caterpillar”), Doosan Group (“Doosan”), Wacker Neuson SE (“Wacker Neuson”), Multi Quip Inc. (“Multi Quip”) and Generac Power Systems (“Generac”). All of them offer towable, trailer-mounted generators. Only Cummins Onan offers an onboard generator and it is specifically engineered for mobile emergency vehicle use. 
 
Portable generators also address a need for mobile electric power in the commercial, leisure and residential markets. As outputs tend to range from 1 to 20 kilowatts, the competition they provide is only at the lowest end of our power output spectrum and only from the higher power, higher quality and higher price commercial level units. Onan, Honda and Kohler are among the well-established brand names in the market. 
 
A standard option that is usually ordered from the manufacturer when purchasing a truck is a power take-off or PTO. PTOs are mounted to a truck’s drivetrain and redirect engine power to operate onboard equipment. Integrated power systems use the PTO to run an alternating current generator. Cool Tech has the capability to power the generator directly from the drivetrain or from a PTO.
 
Real Power from Contour Hardening, Inc. offers one and three phase AC power systems driven by a PTO. According to their website, system voltages range from 10 to 200 kW. Systems under up to 30kW retrofit under the beds of class 3 to 5 diesel trucks. Systems larger than 100 kW require Class 6 diesel trucks and a side mount. An important difference between the Real Power and the MG systems is that MG can generate up to 125 kW on class 3 to 5 trucks and it does so independently from the transmission.
 
Modular integrated systems offer varying combinations of air compressors, welders, hydraulics and generators. Vanair Manufacturing, Inc’s Underdeck uses a PTO to power air compressors, hydraulics and either 6.6 or 9.6 kW generators, according to the Company’s website. A generator-only version outputs up to 25 kW of single-phase power. 
 
HIPPO Multipower packages hydraulic, air, electric and welding into a single unit. The Company website showcases two models, one which connects to a truck’s PTO. The other is powered by a separate diesel engine. Power exported ranges from 5.2 to 9 kW. 
 
The Miller Enpak from Miller Electric Manufacturing Company which is owned by Illinois Tool Works, Inc. offers the same package powered by a separate diesel engine that exports 6 kW of power, according to Miller’s website.
 
Many electric vehicles (“EV”) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (“PHEV”) can use excess battery capacity to provide exportable power with no idling. Most can be recharged from either the electrical grid or the vehicle’s engine. 
 
Via Motors’ website highlights sales of plug-in hybrid electric vans into hybrids. The optional power export module provides 14.4 kW at 60 amps through 120 and 240 volt outlets. The Company is also working on a utility-grade output module to deliver 50 kW. In January of 2018, Via announced it was partnering with China-based Zhejiang Geely New Energy Vehicle Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of Zhejiang Geely Commercial Vehicle Group, to co-develop a medium-duty extended range electric truck. 
 
Workhouse Group, Inc. has announced on their website plans to offer 7.2 Kilowatts of exportable power with an option for 14.4 kilowatts from their W-15 Plug-in Electric Pickup Truck. The Company is taking pre-orders. According to a May 2017 article on MotorTrend.com, the Workhorse W-15 will go into production in late 2018 at a price of $52,500, however, as of January 2019, the Workhouse website was still taking pre-orders.
 
Odyne Systems, LLC, is a manufacturer of hybrid systems for medium and heavy-duty work trucks over 14,000 pounds. According to their website, the systems are capable of exporting 6 to 18 kW of AC power.
 

8

 
Another way EV and PHEV can power onboard equipment is through an ePTO or electric power take-off which is essentially a battery-powered version of a PTO.
 
Terex’s Corporation’s hybrid-electric system, HyPower, targets the utility industry, specifically aerial lift, bucket truck and digger derrick applications. According to the Company’s website, it features a plug-in ePTO that harnesses stored energy from rechargeable batteries to power onboard equipment and export up to 3.8 kW of power for up to six hours before needing to be recharged. 
 
Efficient Drivetrains, Inc. (“EDI”) develops and markets a range of PHEV and EV drivetrain systems. The drivetrain integrates with light, medium, or heavy-duty vehicle designs. Their exportable power options provide 50 up to 160 kW of power for up to 12 hours. As noted in their website, the Company recently introduced a Class 6 plug-in hybrid electric truck that exports as much as 160 kW of power. On July 2, 2018, Cummins, Inc. announced that it had acquired Efficient Drivetrains. 
EDI is one of the few companies that offers an option to export synchronized power that enables the vehicle to connect directly to the utility power grid (V2G). 
 
Electric Vehicles International, a subsidiary of First Priority Greenfleet, replaces stock transmissions with a drive system that operates in hybrid or electric modes. According to the Company’s website, a V2G option exports up to a 120 kW of grid-synchronized power. 
 
Allison Transmission partnered with another company to offer a generator integrated with the transmission into a single casing. The TITAN On-Board Vehicle Power produces electrical power from 30 to 125 kW for medium tactical and combat vehicles which can weigh as much as 40,000 pounds.
 
While both the MG and the Titan are retrofittable, there are important differences. The Titan is limited to new vehicles that incorporate the Allison 3,000 Series Transmission and is not available as a retrofit. The MG can produce up to 125 kW on an 8,000 pound as opposed to a 40,000-pound vehicle. Also, the MG’s power is produced independently from the transmission, consequently, the truck can still operate if the generator stops working. 
 
Other companies use a vehicle's engine to charge on-board batteries, which then run the generator when the vehicle is stopped. While this eliminates idling, output tends to be less than 50 kilowatts (kW) and lithium-ion batteries typically power the system. The batteries have limited runtimes and a shorter lifespan than acid batteries. In addition, they must be cooled to operate properly. 
 
Altec Inc. JEMS (Jobsite Energy Management System) is an integrated plug-in system that uses stored electrical energy to power equipment and provide up to 4 kW of exportable power, according to the Company’s website.
 
Two companies dominate belt driven systems: Aura Systems, Inc. and Mobile Electric Power Solutions, Inc. ("MEPS"). Both systems use a vehicle's engine to power a generator and produce electricity whenever the engine is running. The interface to the vehicle is under the hood via a separate belt system. 
 
Aura Systems generates up to 20 kW whereas MEPS provides up to 15 kW. Both companies provide clean power to operate sophisticated electronic equipment. MEPS delivers alternating current ("AC") power, whereas Aura Systems outputs both AC and direct current ("DC").
 
A variety of MEPS engine or transmission-based electrical power take-off systems also provide exportable power. They tend to output small amounts in the range of 7 kW of 110/220 volt power. MEPS is able to align two generators to double the output to 15 kW. 
 
Our Mobile Generation system can also be used as a Level 2 charging unit for electric vehicles. ‘Levels’ indicate the charging power. The higher the level, the higher the power. More power equals shorter charging times. Level 2 is typically 240 volt AC current. It is compatible with most electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Depending on the battery technology, it takes about 4 to 6 hours to fully charge an electric vehicle. By utilizing the system’s telematics capability and its associated connection to the Internet, an MG retrofitted truck can be alerted by either the driver or the electric vehicle itself.

We currently intend to offer Level 3 charging which relies on 480 volt DC (direct current) power within a year. Most Level 3 chargers provide an 80% charge in 30 minutes. At that point, we believe that the system should become a viable and cost-effective substitute for a standard charging station.
 
The only competition for mobile electric vehicle charging of which we are aware is Real Power, a division of Contour Hardening, Inc. Their self-contained system allows for Level 3 DC fast charging of compatible electric vehicles and uses a PTO driven generator. As noted above, Real Power cannot output more than 30 kW on Class 3-5 trucks. To achieve Level 3 DC fast charging, their system requires a class 6 vehicle.
 
Mobi EV Charger offers a battery powered electric chargers that are essentially batteries on wheels with a built-in drive system operated by a joystick. It is designed for fixed locations such as parking lots and dealerships and, consequently, it is not street legal. The Level 3 fast charger is equipped with a 160-kilowatt-hour battery and will charge at around 50 kilowatts. The charger is due to enter beta trials in the second quarter of 2019.
 
Another variation on mobile charging relies on a self-contained unit that is dropped into place. EVgo launched Fast Start, which incorporates a pair of 50-kilowatt fast chargers on a metal sled. 
 
EV Safe Charge offers EV Charge Mobile, a temporary Level 2 and DC fast charging systems delivered to locations on demand Volkswagen intends to offer a similar system with up to 360 kWh charging capacity. According to a press release, the first charging stations will be set up in first half of 2019.
 
Both the battery-on-wheels and the delivery and drop-off systems aim to address the problems with permitting, construction and electrical infrastructure upgrades common to permanent charging installations.
 
Some of our potential competitors are significantly larger than we are, have been in business much longer than we have, and have significantly more resources at their disposal and may be able to respond more quickly and efficiently to changes in the marketplace, whether as a result of technological, economic or customer requirements or preferences. 
 
This also enhances their ability to obtain top engineering talent as well as sales representatives with strong industry ties. Plus, their greater market clout could effectively overwhelm our promotional and marketing efforts.
 
Equipment
 
As a company that intends to commercialize or license its proprietary technology for others to install, manufacture and/or distribute, our equipment needs are project specific and temporary. We do not intend to purchase any production equipment to implement our business operations, but instead we will rent, lease or outsource as needed.
Manufacturing
 
We do not plan to manufacture in-house. The Company works with Craftsmen Industries utilizing its assets and system integrators to up-fit our Mobile Generation technology. For our thermal technologies, the Company plans to rely on product development agreements with manufacturers who will then pay a license or royalty per unit. We anticipate that such agreements will delineate the respective intellectual property owned by both companies, describe the goal of the testing to verify the savings and value to a particular company, the equipment to be modified, the criteria that constitute successful testing, how and where the tests will be conducted and the next steps to be taken in the event of successful testing. 
Suppliers
 
For mobile power generation, the required software and its vehicle integration will be supplied by Czero, Inc. along with partner truck up-fitter, Craftsman Industries and others to be named later.

10

 
Production level quantities of system components will be handled by a variety of suppliers such as Panasonic, Nidec Motor Corporation and Woodward, an independent designer, manufacturer, and service provider of control solutions for the aerospace and industrial markets. 
 
Panasonic System Communications Company of North America supplies Panasonic Toughpad tablets, equipped with the CoolTech software to function as the Human Machine Interfaces. Field technicians control and calibrate the Mobile Generation systems through the touchscreens. The Toughpads are deployed in the trucks’ cabs. 
 
For the thermal technology applications in electric motors, Aavid Thermacore, a division of Boyd Corporation, will supply the heat pipes and mechanical structure, which combine to make the heat exchangers. We will coordinate with them to combine our thermal technology with Aavid Thermacore technology in the creation of heat exchangers. 
 
For dry pit submersibles (a type of submersible pump which can also operate in a dry environment), we intend to purchase the wound stator and the rotor-shaft from Nidec Motor Corporation or other partner sources such as Baldor Electric, Regal Beloit and others. We intend to purchase the fully-machined castings from the Quality Castings Company, located in Orville, Ohio. We intend that these components will then be assembled and tested by Consulting Point, Inc. located in Brownsville, Texas or another partner assembler in the USA. 
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Currently, we have no licenses or contractual rights in place to protect our technology and intellectual property, only patents or patents pending. 
 
As of April 1, 2019, we have seven US patents, one Mexican patent and five pending patent applications (2 in Canada, 1 in Brazil, 2 in US) covering composite heat structures, motors and related structures, heat pipe architecture, applications (commonly referred to as "thermal" or "heat dispersion technology") and a parallel vehicle platform system. We also have a Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) application pending that covers integrated electrical power generation methods and systems. In addition, we have applied for and received a trademark for an acronym for one of our technologies: "TEHPC"
 
Our success will likely depend upon our ability to preserve our proprietary technologies and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of other parties. However, we may also rely on certain proprietary technologies and know-how that are not patentable. 
 
We strive to protect such proprietary information, in part, by the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and contractors. The Company has a policy of not disclosing its patent applications in order to protect the underlying technology. 
 
The following table sets forth the patents we own or license which we believe support our technology.

Government and Industry Regulation
 
We intend to conduct business worldwide and, therefore, we must comply with local, state, federal, and international regulations, both in operations and for our products. 
 
As a company, we do not plan to manufacture any of our products. Therefore, the government regulations we will be subject to will be limited to storage and involve rotating the shafts of stored electric motors on a regular basis.
 
Applicable laws and regulations include those governing, among other things, the handling, storage and transportation of materials and products as well as noise and employee safety. 
 
In addition, some of our products are subject to various laws and regulations relating to, among other things, emissions and fuel requirements. 
 
Accordingly, we may be required or may voluntarily determine to obtain approval of our products from one or more of the organizations engaged in regulating product or environmental safety. These approvals could require significant time and resources from our technical staff and, if redesign were necessary, could result in a delay in the introduction of our products in various markets and applications.
 
Although we believe that our operations and products are in material compliance with current applicable regulations noted within this section, there can be no assurance that changes in such laws and regulations will not impose costly compliance requirements on us or otherwise subject us to future liabilities. New regulations could also require our licensees to redesign their products which could cause us to redesign our technologies which, consequently, could affect market growth for our products.
 
As our thermal technologies are incorporated in existing motors, generators and other manufactured products that are already subject to regulation. The regulatory burden will fall on the original equipment manufacturers that license our technology. 
 
The Company adds a mobile power generation system to Class 3-8 work trucks. In addition to an existing generator incorporating our thermal technology, the stand-alone version of our auxiliary mobile power system will include a specialized gearing package, which connects the drive train to a generator that will be added on-board. The vehicle and drive train operate normally in accordance with manufacturer's specifications. No regulations are violated or exceeded. Nonetheless, in some markets, the Company will have to certify that it meets federal, state or local noise and emission regulations. 
 
Our designs comply with current EPA emission standards and we believe they will comply with future requirements. 
 
No original vehicle parts will be significantly modified in the retrofitting process. There will be some additional parts (generator, gearing system, touchscreens, software, sensors and controls) added, but these parts will not change how the vehicle operates in any way. Although we will be adding a gearing package to connect the drive train to the generator, the rest of the drive train will operate according to the manufacturer's specifications. Therefore, we believe that the original warranty will remain in effect and we do not believe that the conversion will violate the Magnuson-Moss Act.
 
The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act is a federal law that protects consumers by barring a vehicle manufacturer from voiding the warranty on a vehicle due to an aftermarket part unless the manufacturer can prove that the aftermarket part caused or contributed to the failure in the vehicle. The Company will warranty the MG System with an industry standard warranty. All of our other components (generator, human machine interface, software, controller/sensors) will be warranted by their respective manufacturers.

The Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA") is charged with writing and enforcing safety and fuel economy standards for motor vehicles through their Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. These standards require manufacturers to design their electrically powered vehicles so that, in the event of a crash, the electrical energy storage, conversion, and traction systems are either electrically isolated from the vehicle's chassis or their voltage is below specified levels considered safe from electric shock hazards. Our planned no-idle version of our Mobile Generation system will be designed to meet or exceed these requirements. 
 
In addition, the total weight of the additional components should remain within the vehicle's gross vehicle weight rating. As a result, we believe that our retrofits will comply with federal and state transportation regulations.
 
While we do not create and market our products around government subsidies and tax incentives, an MG truck equipped with a charger can provide a Level II charge to one or more electric vehicles. Our 200 kVA truck will enable Level III DC fast charging capability. Assuming the MG truck qualifies as a charging station at least 27 states and a number of municipalities offer tax credits or rebates for electric vehicle charging stations.
 
If we fulfill all elements of our business plan, we will have to prepare for, understand and ultimately meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world. Our products will have to comply with the current emission standards that went into effect in the European Union in 2015, as well as the standards in other international markets, including Japan, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, Russia, India, and China that are becoming more stringent. 
 
Employees
 
As of April 1, 2019, we had three full time employees and no part time employees. We hope to hire additional employees, on an as-needed basis, subject to sufficient funding, as products and services are developed. 
Research and Development
 
During the years 2018 and 2017, we incurred research and development costs of $501,342 and $348,424, respectively. Such costs were not borne directly by customers.
