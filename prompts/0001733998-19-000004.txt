ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
On October 1, 2018, we completed a reorganization into a holding company structure. We believe that our holding company structure is an agile and efficient platform from which to pursue, finance, and oversee new opportunities, such as in the water sector, while also providing legal separation between regulated natural gas distribution operations and other businesses. In this reorganization, shareholders of NW Natural (the predecessor publicly held parent company) became shareholders of NW Holdings, on a one-for-one basis, with the same number of shares and same ownership percentage as they held in NW Natural immediately prior to the reorganization. NW Natural became a wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Holdings. Additionally, certain subsidiaries of NW Natural were transferred to NW Holdings. As required under accounting guidance, these subsidiaries are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated results of NW Natural within this report.
NW Holdings is a holding company headquartered in Portland, Oregon and owns NW Natural, NW Natural Water Company (NW Water), and other businesses and activities. NW Natural is NW Holdings’ largest subsidiary. 
NW Natural distributes natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers in Oregon and southwest Washington. NW Natural and its predecessors have supplied gas service to the public since 1859, was 


incorporated in Oregon in 1910, and began doing business as NW Natural in 1997. NW Natural's natural gas distribution activities are reported in the natural gas distribution (NGD) segment, formerly titled and reported as the utility segment. All other business activities, including certain gas storage activities, water businesses, and other investments and activities are aggregated and reported as "other" at their respective registrant.
In addition, NW Holdings has reported discontinued operations results related to the pending sale of Gill Ranch Storage, LLC (Gill Ranch). NW Natural Gas Storage, LLC (NWN Gas Storage), currently an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Holdings, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement during the second quarter of 2018 that provides for the sale of all membership interests in Gill Ranch. Gill Ranch owns a 75% interest in the natural gas storage facility located near Fresno, California known as the Gill Ranch Gas Storage Facility. Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) owns the remaining 25% interest in the Gill Ranch Gas Storage Facility.
NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION (NGD) SEGMENT
Both NW Holdings and NW Natural have one reportable segment, the NGD segment, which is conducted by NW Natural. The NGD business purchases and distributes natural gas through approximately 750,000 meters in Oregon and southwest Washington. Approximately 89% of customers are located in Oregon and 11% are located in southwest Washington. 
NW Natural has been allocated an exclusive service territory by the OPUC and WUTC, which includes the major population centers in western Oregon, including the Portland metropolitan area, most of the Willamette Valley, the Coastal area from Astoria to Coos Bay, and portions of Washington along the Columbia River. Portland serves as one of the largest ports on the West Coast and is a key distribution center. Major businesses located in NW Natural's service territory include retail, manufacturing, and high-technology industries. 
Customers
The NGD business serves residential, commercial, and industrial customers with no individual customer accounting for more than 10% of NW Natural or NW Holdings revenues. On an annual basis, residential and commercial customers typically account for approximately 60% of NGD volumes delivered and approximately 90% of margin. Industrial customers largely account for the remaining volumes and margin. 
The following table presents summary meter information for the NGD segment as of December 31, 2018:
 | Number of Meters | % of Volumes | | % of Margin (1)
Residential | 680,134 | | 37 | % | 65 | %
Commercial | 69,259 | | 22 | % | 27 | %
Industrial | 1,028 | | 41 | % | 8 | %
Other | N/A | | N/A | | — | %
Total | 750,421 | | 100 | % | 100 | %

(1) | NGD margin is also affected by other items, including miscellaneous services, gains or losses from our gas cost incentive sharing mechanism, and other service fees.

Generally, residential and commercial customers purchase both their natural gas commodity (gas sales) and natural gas delivery services (transportation services) from the NGD business. Industrial customers also purchase transportation services, but may buy the gas commodity either from NW Natural or directly from a third-party gas marketer or supplier. Gas commodity cost is primarily a pass-through cost to customers; therefore, profit margins are not materially affected by an industrial customer's decision to purchase gas from NW Natural or from third parties. Industrial and large commercial customers may also select between firm and interruptible service levels, with firm services generally providing higher profit margins compared to interruptible services.
To help manage gas supplies, industrial tariffs are designed to provide some certainty regarding industrial customers' volumes by requiring an annual service election, special charges for changes between elections, and in some cases, a minimum or maximum volume requirement before changing options. 
Customer growth rates for natural gas utilities in the Pacific Northwest historically have been among the highest in the nation due to lower market saturation as natural gas became widely available as a residential heating source after other fuel options. We estimate natural gas was in approximately 63% of single-family residential homes in NW Natural's service territory in 2018. Customer growth in our region comes mainly from the following sources: single-family housing, both new construction and conversions; multifamily housing new construction; and commercial buildings, both new construction and conversions. Single-family new construction has consistently been our strongest performing source of growth. Continued customer growth is closely tied to the comparative price of natural gas to electricity and fuel oil and the economic health of Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington. We believe there is potential for continued growth as natural gas is a preferred energy source due to its affordable, reliable, and clean qualities. 
Competitive Conditions
In its service areas, the NGD business has no direct competition from other natural gas distributors. However, it competes with other forms of energy in each customer class. This competition among energy suppliers is based on price, efficiency, reliability, performance, preference, market conditions, technology, federal, state, and local energy policy, and environmental impacts. 
For residential and small to mid-size commercial customers, the NGD business competes primarily with providers of electricity, fuel oil, and propane.
In the industrial and large commercial markets, the NGD business competes with all forms of energy, including competition from wholesale natural gas marketers. In addition, large industrial customers could bypass NW Natural's natural gas distribution system by installing their own direct pipeline connection to the interstate pipeline 


system. NW Natural has designed custom transportation service agreements with several large industrial customers to provide transportation service rates that are competitive with the customer’s costs of installing their own pipeline.
Seasonality of Business
The NGD business is seasonal in nature due to higher gas usage by residential and commercial customers during the cold winter heating months. Other categories of customers experience similar seasonality in their usage but to a lesser extent.
Regulation and Rates
The NGD business is subject to regulation by the OPUC and WUTC. These regulatory agencies authorize rates and allow recovery mechanisms to provide the opportunity to recover prudently incurred capital and operating costs from customers, while also earning a reasonable return on investment for investors. In addition, the OPUC and WUTC also regulate the system of accounts and issuance of securities by NW Natural.
NW Natural files general rate cases and rate tariff requests periodically with the OPUC and WUTC to establish approved rates, an authorized ROE, an overall rate of return on rate base (ROR), an authorized capital structure, and other revenue/cost deferral and recovery mechanisms. 
NW Natural is also regulated by the FERC. Under NW Natural's Mist interstate storage certificate with FERC, NW Natural is required to file either a petition for rate approval or a cost and revenue study every five years to change or justify maintaining the existing rates for the interstate storage service. 
For further discussion on our most recent general rate cases, see Part II, Item 7, "Results of Operations—Regulatory Matters—Regulation and Rates".
Gas Supply
NW Natural strives to secure sufficient, reliable supplies of natural gas to meet the needs of customers at the lowest reasonable cost, while maintaining price stability and managing gas purchase costs prudently. This is accomplished through a comprehensive strategy focused on the following items:

• | Reliability - ensuring gas resource portfolios are sufficient to satisfy customer requirements under extreme cold weather conditions;


• | Diverse Supply - providing diversity of supply sources;


• | Diverse Contracts - maintaining a variety of contract durations, types, and counterparties; and


• | Cost Management and Recovery - employing prudent gas cost management strategies.

Reliability
The effectiveness of the natural gas distribution system ultimately rests on whether reliable service is provided to NGD customers. To ensure effectiveness, the NGD business has developed a risk-based methodology in which it uses a planning standard to serve the highest firm sales demand day in any year with 99% certainty. 
The projected maximum design day firm NGD customer sendout is approximately 10.0 million therms. Of this total, 


9

the NGD business is currently capable of meeting about 56% of requirements with gas from storage located within or adjacent to the service territory, while the remaining supply requirements would come from gas purchases under firm gas purchase contracts and recall agreements. 
To supplement near-term natural gas supplies, NW Natural can segment transportation capacity, if needed. Pipeline segmentation is a natural gas transportation mechanism under which a shipper can leverage its firm pipeline transportation capacity by separating it into multiple segments with alternate delivery routes. The reliability of service on these alternate routes will vary depending on the constraints of the pipeline system. For those segments with acceptable reliability, segmentation provides a shipper with increased flexibility and potential cost savings compared to traditional pipeline service. Since 2014, the NGD business has relied on segmentation of firm pipeline transportation capacity that flows from Stanfield, Oregon to various points south of Molalla, Oregon. 
We believe gas supplies would be sufficient to meet existing NGD firm customer demand in the event of maximum design day weather conditions. 
The following table shows the sources of supply projected to be used to satisfy the design day sendout for the 2018-2019 winter heating season:

Therms in millions | Therms | Percent
Sources of NGD supply: | | 
Firm supply purchases | 3.4 | | 34 | %
Mist underground storage (NGD only) | 3.1 | | 31 | %
Company-owned LNG storage | 1.9 | | 19 | %
Off-system storage contract | 0.5 | | 5 | %
Pipeline segmentation capacity | 0.6 | | 6 | %
Recall agreements | 0.4 | | 4 | %
Peak day citygate deliveries | 0.1 | | 1 | %
Total | 10.0 | | 100 | %

The OPUC and WUTC have IRP processes in which utilities define different growth scenarios and corresponding resource acquisition strategies in an effort to evaluate supply and demand resource requirements, consider uncertainties in the planning process and the need for flexibility to respond to changes, and establish a plan for providing reliable service at the least cost.
NW Natural files a full IRP biennially for Oregon and Washington with the OPUC and the WUTC, respectively, and files updates between filings. The OPUC acknowledges NW Natural's action plan; whereas the WUTC provides notice that the IRP has met the requirements of the Washington Administrative Code. OPUC acknowledgment of the IRP does not constitute ratemaking approval of any specific resource acquisition strategy or expenditure. However, the Commissioners generally indicate that they would give considerable weight in prudence reviews to actions consistent with acknowledged plans. The WUTC has indicated the IRP process is one factor it will consider in a prudence review.  For additional information see Part II, Item 7, "Results of Operations—Regulatory Matters".


Diversity of Supply Sources
NW Natural purchases gas supplies primarily from the Alberta and British Columbia provinces of Canada and multiple receipt points in the U.S. Rocky Mountains to protect against regional supply disruptions and to take advantage of price differentials. For 2018, 61% of gas supply came from Canada, with the balance primarily coming from the U.S. Rocky Mountain region. We believe gas supplies available in the western United States and Canada are adequate to serve NGD customer requirements for the foreseeable future. NW Natural continues to evaluate the long-term supply mix based on projections of gas production and pricing in the U.S. Rocky Mountain region as well as other regions in North America. Additionally, the extraction of shale gas has increased the availability of gas supplies throughout North America for the foreseeable future.
NW Natural supplements firm gas supply purchases with gas withdrawals from gas storage facilities, including underground reservoirs and LNG storage facilities. Storage facilities are generally injected with natural gas during the off-peak months in the spring and summer, and the gas is withdrawn for use during peak demand months in the winter. 
The following table presents the storage facilities available for NGD business supply: 

 | Maximum Daily Deliverability (therms in millions) | Designed StorageCapacity (Bcf)
Gas Storage Facilities | | 
Owned Facility | | 
Mist, Oregon(1) | 3.1 | | 10.6
Contracted Facility | | 
Jackson Prairie, Washington(2) | 0.5 | | 1.1 
LNG Facilities | | 
Owned Facilities | | 
Newport, Oregon | 0.6 | | 1.0 
Portland, Oregon | 1.3 | | 0.6 
Total | 5.5 | | 13.3


(1) | The Mist gas storage facility has a total maximum daily deliverability of 5.4 million therms and a total designed storage capacity of about 16.0 Bcf, of which 3.1 million therms of daily deliverability and 10.6 Bcf of storage capacity are reserved for NGD business customers.


(2) | The storage facility is located near Chehalis, Washington and is contracted from Northwest Pipeline, a subsidiary of The Williams Companies.

The Mist facility serves NGD segment customers and is also used for non-NGD purposes, primarily for contracts with gas storage customers, including utilities and third-party marketers. Under regulatory agreements with the OPUC and WUTC, gas storage at Mist can be developed in advance of NGD customer needs but is subject to recall when needed to serve such customers as their demand increases. When storage capacity is recalled for NGD purposes it becomes part of the NGD segment. In 2018, the NGD business did not recall additional deliverability or associated storage capacity to serve customer needs.


10

In addition, pipeline capacity and supply resources from certain NW Natural customers may be recalled if needed to meet high demand requirements.
Diverse Contract Durations and Types
NW Natural has a diverse portfolio of short-, medium-, and long-term firm gas supply contracts and a variety of contract types including firm and interruptible supplies as well as supplemental supplies from gas storage facilities. 
The portfolio of firm gas supply contracts typically includes the following gas purchase contracts: year-round and winter-only baseload supplies; seasonal supply with an option to call on additional daily supplies during the winter heating season; and daily or monthly spot purchases.
During 2018, a total of 743 million therms were purchased under contracts with durations outlined in the chart below:

Contract Duration (primary term) | Percent of Purchases
Long-term (one year or longer) | 28 | %
Short-term (more than one month, less than one year) | 27 | 
Spot (one month or less) | 45 | 
Total | 100 | %

Gas supply contracts are renewed or replaced as they expire. During 2018, no individual supplier provided over 10% of the NGD business gas supply requirements. 
Gas Cost Management
The cost of gas sold to NGD customers primarily consists of the following items, which are included in annual PGA rates: gas purchases from suppliers; charges from pipeline companies to transport gas to our distribution system; gas storage costs; gas reserves contracts; and gas commodity derivative contracts.
The NGD business employs a number of strategies to mitigate the cost of gas sold to customers. The primary strategies for managing gas commodity price risk include:

• | negotiating fixed prices directly with gas suppliers;


• | negotiating financial derivative contracts that: (1) effectively convert floating index prices in physical gas supply contracts to fixed prices (referred to as commodity price swaps); or (2) effectively set a ceiling or floor price, or both, on floating index priced physical supply contracts (referred to as commodity price options such as calls, puts, and collars);


• | buying physical gas supplies at a set price and injecting the gas into storage for price stability and to minimize pipeline capacity demand costs; and


• | investing in gas reserves for longer term price stability. See Note 12 for additional information about our gas reserves.

NW Natural also contracts with an independent energy marketing company to capture opportunities regarding storage and pipeline capacity when those assets are not serving the needs of NGD business customers. Asset management activities provide opportunities for cost of gas savings for customers and incremental revenues for NW Natural through regulatory incentive-sharing mechanisms. 


These activities, net of the amount shared, are included in other for segment reporting purposes.
Gas Cost Recovery
Mechanisms for gas cost recovery are designed to be fair and reasonable, with an appropriate balance between the interests of customers and NW Natural. In general, natural gas distribution rates are designed to recover the costs of, but not to earn a return on, the gas commodity sold. Risks associated with gas cost recovery are minimized by resetting customer rates annually through the PGA and aligning customer and shareholder interests through the use of sharing, weather normalization, and conservation mechanisms in Oregon. See Part II, Item 7, "Results of Operations—Regulatory Matters" and "Results of Operations—Business Segments—Natural Gas Distribution Operations—Cost of Gas."
Transportation of Gas Supplies
NW Natural's gas distribution system is reliant on a single, bi-directional interstate transmission pipeline to bring gas supplies into the natural gas distribution system. Although dependent on a single pipeline, the pipeline’s gas flows into the Portland metropolitan market from two directions: (1) the north, which brings supplies from the British Columbia and Alberta supply basins; and (2) the east, which brings supplies from Alberta as well as the U.S. Rocky Mountain supply basins.
NW Natural incurs monthly demand charges related to firm pipeline transportation contracts. These contracts are multi-year contracts with expirations ranging from 2019 to 2060. The largest pipeline agreements are with Northwest Pipeline. NW Natural actively works with Northwest Pipeline and others to renew contracts in advance of expiration to ensure gas transportation capacity is sufficient to meet customer needs. 
Rates for interstate pipeline transportation services are established by FERC within the U.S. and by Canadian authorities for services on Canadian pipelines.
As mentioned above, the service territory is dependent on a single pipeline for its natural gas supply. In October 2018, a critical natural gas pipeline in western Canada experienced a rupture and gas supply to the Pacific Northwest was disrupted. NW Natural was able to serve firm NGD business customers during the incident with natural gas from the Mist storage facility and realignment of other supplies. Pipeline disruptions, replacement projects, and long-term projected natural gas demand in our region underscore the need for pipeline transportation diversity. In addition, there are potential industrial projects in the region, which could increase the demand for natural gas and the need for additional pipeline capacity and diversity. 
Currently, there are various interstate pipeline projects proposed, including the Trail West pipeline in which NW Holdings has an interest, that could meet the forecasted demand growth for NW Natural and the region. However, the location of any future pipeline project will likely depend on the location of committed industrial projects. NW Holdings and NW Natural will continue to evaluate and closely monitor the currently prospected projects to determine the best option for our customers. NW Holdings 


11

has an equity investment in Trail West Holdings, LLC (TWH), which is developing plans to build the Trail West pipeline. This pipeline would connect TransCanada Pipelines Limited’s (TransCanada) Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN) interstate transmission line to NW Natural's natural gas distribution system. If constructed, this pipeline would provide another transportation path for gas purchases from Alberta and the U.S. Rocky Mountains in addition to the one that currently moves gas through the Northwest Pipeline system. 
Gas Distribution
The primary goals of gas distribution operations are safety and reliability of the system, which entails building and maintaining a safe pipeline distribution system. 
Safety and the protection of employees, customers, and the public at large are, and will remain, top priorities. NW Natural constructs, operates, and maintains the pipeline distribution system and storage operations with the goal of ensuring natural gas is delivered and stored safely, reliably, and efficiently. 
NW Natural has one of the most modern distribution systems in the country with no identified cast iron pipe or bare steel main. The final known bare steel was removed from the system in 2015 and cast iron pipe removal was completed in 2000. Since the 1980s, NW Natural has taken a proactive approach to replacement programs and partnered with the OPUC and WUTC on progressive regulation to further safety and reliability efforts for the distribution system. In the past, NW Natural had a cost recovery program in Oregon that encompassed programs for bare steel replacement, transmission pipeline integrity management, and distribution pipeline integrity management as appropriate. For discussion on current regulatory programs, see Part II, Item 7, "Results of Operations—Regulatory Matters". 
Natural gas distribution businesses will continue to be subject to greater federal and state regulation in the future due to pipeline incidents involving other companies. 
Additional operating and safety regulations from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) are currently under development. In 2016, PHMSA issued proposed regulations to update safety requirements for natural gas transmission pipelines. Final regulations are anticipated to be issued in 2019. Current proposed regulations indicate a 15-year timeline for implementation of compliance requirements. NW Natural will continue to work diligently with industry associations as well as federal and state regulators to ensure the safety of the system and compliance with new laws and regulations. The costs associated with compliance with federal, state, and local rules are expected to be recovered in rates.
North Mist Gas Storage Expansion Project
In Oregon, there is a need to integrate intermittent resources, such as wind and solar, into the power system with policymakers committing to the elimination of coal-fired electric generation and moving toward a 50% renewable electricity standard by 2040. Flexible natural gas-fired electric generation facilities and associated gas storage are necessary to support the integration of renewable 


resources. In 2016, NW Natural began expanding its gas storage facility near Mist, Oregon to provide innovative long-term, no-notice underground gas storage service to support gas-fired electric generating facilities that are intended to facilitate the integration of more wind power into the region's electric generation mix. Natural gas storage enables generation to adjust quickly when renewable energy, such as wind and solar, rises and falls. 
This expansion project will be dedicated solely to Portland General Electric (Portland General), a local electric company, to support their gas-fired electric power generation facilities under an initial 30-year contract with options to extend, totaling up to an additional 50 years upon mutual agreement of the parties. 
The expansion project includes a new reservoir providing up to 2.5 Bcf of available storage, an additional compressor station with design capacity of 120,000 dekatherms of gas per day, no-notice service that can be drawn on rapidly, and a 13-mile pipeline to connect to Portland General's gas plants at Port Westward. The expansion project is considered part of the NGD segment and has an estimated cost of approximately $149 million, with a targeted in-service date during the spring of 2019. See additional discussion in Part II, Item 7 "Financial Condition—Cash Flows—Investing Activities". 
When the expansion is placed into service, the investment will be included in rate base under an established tariff schedule already approved by the OPUC, with revenues recognized consistent with the schedule. Billing rates will be updated annually to the current depreciable asset level and forecasted operating expenses. 
While there are additional expansion opportunities in the Mist storage field, further development is not contemplated at this time and any expansion would be based on market demand, project execution, cost effectiveness, available financing, receipt of future permits, and other rights.
OTHER
Certain businesses and activities of NW Holdings and NW Natural are aggregated and reported as other for segment reporting purposes. These include the following businesses and activities aggregated and reported as other under NW Holdings:

• | water businesses and water acquisition activities;


• | an equity method investment in TWH, a joint venture to build and operate a gas transmission pipeline in Oregon. TWH is owned 50% by NWN Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Holdings, and 50% by TransCanada American Investments Ltd., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of TransCanada Corporation;


• | a minority interest in the Kelso-Beaver Pipeline held by our wholly-owned subsidiary NNG Financial Corporation (NNG Financial); and


• | holding company and corporate activities as well as adjustments made in consolidation.

Additionally, the following businesses and activities are aggregated and reported as other under NW Natural, a wholly owned subsidiary of NW Holdings: 


12


• | 5.4 Bcf of the Mist gas storage facility contracted to utilities and third-party marketers;


• | natural gas asset management activities; and


• | appliance retail center operations.

WATER. During 2018, NW Water completed the purchase of four privately-owned regulated water utilities serving approximately 22,000 people through 7,400 connections in the Pacific Northwest. Several additional acquisition agreements for privately-owned water utilities have been signed, the largest of which is a water and wastewater business in Sunriver, Oregon serving 9,400 connections. These pending transactions are subject to public utility commission approvals and are expected to close during 2019.
MIST GAS STORAGE. The Mist gas storage facility began operations in 1989. It is a 16 Bcf facility with 10.6 Bcf used to provide gas storage for the NGD business. The remaining 5.4 Bcf of the facility is contracted with other utilities and third-party marketers with these results reported in other. 
The overall facility consists of seven depleted natural gas reservoirs, 22 injection and withdrawal wells, a compressor station, dehydration and control equipment, gathering lines, and other related facilities. The capacity at Mist serving other utilities and third-party marketers provides multi-cycle gas storage services to customers in the interstate and intrastate markets. The interstate storage services are offered under a limited jurisdiction blanket certificate issued by FERC. Under NW Natural's interstate storage certificate with FERC, NW Natural is required to file either a petition for rate approval or a cost and revenue study every five years to change or justify maintaining the existing rates for the interstate storage service. Intrastate firm storage services in Oregon are offered under an OPUC-approved rate schedule as an optional service to certain eligible customers. Gas storage revenues from the 5.4 Bcf are derived primarily from firm service customers who provide energy-related services, including natural gas distribution, electric generation, and energy marketing. The Mist facility benefits from limited competition as there are few storage facilities in the Pacific Northwest region. Therefore, NW Natural is able to acquire high value, multi-year contracts.
ASSET MANAGEMENT ACTIVITES. NW Natural contracts with an independent energy marketing company to provide asset management services, primarily through the use of natural gas commodity exchange agreements and natural gas pipeline capacity release transactions. The results of these activities are included in other, except for the asset management revenues allocated to NGD business customers pursuant to regulatory agreements, which are reported in the NGD segment. 


ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Properties and Facilities
NW Natural owns, or previously owned, properties and facilities that are currently being investigated that may require environmental remediation and are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to environmental matters. These laws and regulations may require expenditures over a long time frame to address certain environmental impacts. Estimates of liabilities for environmental costs are difficult to determine with precision because of the various factors that can affect their ultimate disposition. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | the complexity of the site;


• | changes in environmental laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local levels;


• | the number of regulatory agencies or other parties involved;


• | new technology that renders previous technology obsolete, or experience with existing technology that proves ineffective;


• | the ultimate selection of a particular technology;


• | the level of remediation required;


• | variations between the estimated and actual period of time that must be dedicated to respond to an environmentally-contaminated site; and


• | the application of environmental laws that impose joint and several liabilities on all potentially responsible parties.


NW Natural has received recovery of a portion of such environmental costs through insurance proceeds, seeks the remainder of such costs through customer rates, and believes recovery of these costs is probable. In Oregon, NW Natural has a mechanism to recover expenses, subject to an earnings test and allocation rules. See Part II, Item 7, "Results of Operations—Rate Matters—Rate Mechanisms—Environmental Costs", Note 2, and Note 17.
Greenhouse Gas Matters
We recognize our businesses are likely to be affected by requirements to address greenhouse gas emissions. Future federal, state or local requirements may seek to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, including both carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. These potential laws and regulations may require certain activities to reduce emissions and/or increase the price paid for energy based on its carbon content.
Current federal rules require the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. In September 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule requiring the annual reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain industries, specified large greenhouse gas emission sources, and facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2 equivalents per year. NW Natural began reporting emission information in 2011. Under this reporting rule, local natural gas distribution companies like NW Natural are required to report system throughput to the EPA on an annual basis. The EPA also has required additional greenhouse gas reporting regulations to which NW Natural is subject, requiring the annual reporting of fugitive emissions from operations.


13

The Oregon and Washington legislatures and governors continue to consider various greenhouse gas reduction proposals and initiatives. For example, the Oregon legislature will be considering a cap and trade bill during the 2019 legislative session that could create a declining cap on greenhouse gas emissions emitted by a wide variety of emission sources, including electric and natural gas utilities, and would require those entities with a compliance obligation to hold permits, or allowances, to emit greenhouse gas emissions on a per ton basis. While there is uncertainty regarding the extent of the legislation, potential compliance costs, and cost sharing impacts of these and other similar proposals, NW Natural currently expects to be able to recover compliance costs associated with this type of legislation in rates.
The state of Washington's Department of Ecology (DOE) enacted the Clean Air Rule (CAR) in 2016, which capped the maximum greenhouse gas emissions allowed from stationary sources, such as natural gas utilities. For gas distribution utilities, the production of emissions from usage by their customers was considered to be production of emissions attributable to the utility. In December 2017, a Washington State Court ruled that the DOE lacked legislative authority to regulate non-emitting sources, such as local distribution companies. The DOE has appealed the ruling and oral arguments for the appeal are expected to take place during 2019.
The outcome of these or any additional federal, state or local climate change policy developments cannot be determined at this time, but these initiatives could produce a number of results including new regulations, legal actions, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, or other regulatory actions. The adoption and implementation of any regulations limiting emissions of greenhouse gases could require NW Natural to incur compliance costs associated with our customers’ use, resulting in an increase in the prices charged to those customers and in a potential decline in the demand for natural gas over time. 
With environmental stewardship as one of our core values, we continue to take proactive steps to address greenhouse gas emissions in our region and the communities we serve. We believe NW Natural and its modern pipeline system has an important role to play in helping the Pacific Northwest move to a low-carbon, renewable-energy future. 
We intend to vigorously pursue our role in a low-carbon future, and believe we are positioned to do so. Currently, NW Natural delivers more energy in Oregon than any other utility, and use of natural gas by our Sales and Transportation customers’ accounts for approximately 8% of Oregon’s greenhouse gas emissions according to the State of Oregon Department of Environmental Quality In-Boundary GHG Inventory Preliminary 2015 Figures. Sales of natural gas to residential and commercial customers - customers NW Natural procures gas for - accounts for approximately 5% of the state’s emissions. Using this as a starting baseline, in 2017, NW Natural initiated a multi-pronged, multi-year core utility strategy to deliver greater emission reductions. Key components of this strategy include energy efficiency and the continued adoption of the company’s voluntary Smart Energy carbon offset program. NW Natural is also actively pursuing the potential to procure 


renewable natural gas for our customers, and is engaging in longer-term efforts to explore the development of renewable hydrogen through power to gas.
