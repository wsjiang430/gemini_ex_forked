Overview
 We are a medical device company focused on providing solutions for patients suffering from fluid overload. Our commercial product, the Aquadex FlexFlow® system, is indicated for temporary (up to eight hours) ultrafiltration treatment of patients with fluid overload who have failed diuretic therapy and extended (longer than 8 hours) ultrafiltration treatment of patients with fluid overload who have failed diuretic therapy and require hospitalization.
Fluid Overload
 Fluid overload, also known as hypervolemia, is a condition in which there is too much fluid in the blood and generally refers to the expansion of the extracellular fluid volume. Although the body does need some amount of fluid to remain healthy, too much can cause an imbalance and damage to an individuals health.
 The signs and symptoms of fluid overload are not always the same in each patient and may vary. However, possible signs and symptoms of fluid overload include: pitting edema, pulmonary edema/pleural effusion, jugular vein distention, dyspnea, or ascites. Medical conditions or diseases where excess fluid accumulates in the body are: heart failure, kidney failure, nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis, or burn injuries/trauma. Individuals may also suffer from temporary fluid overload following certain surgical procedures, such as cardiac surgery. The diagnosis of fluid overload can be made through a variety of tests/exams such as a physical exam (weight and edema), blood chemistry, ECG or EKG, GFR, liver enzymes, and urinalysis, or serum/urine sodium test. Fluid overload has a significant association with the combined events of death, infection, bleeding, arrhythmia, and pulmonary edema1 and is a leading cause of readmissions with patients suffering from heart failure and patients following cardiac surgery.
 The condition of fluid overload is often observed in patients with heart failure and secondary oliguric states.2 Most of the symptoms of congestive heart failure result from extracellular fluid volume. For this reason, diuretics have been the cornerstone of heart failure treatment for more than 50 years. Over the past 20 years, approaches to treatment have changed dramatically.3 These dramatic improvements include new medications and new technologies, such as ultrafiltration, to help treat fluid overload.

  Treatments for Fluid Overload 
 Diuretics
 Treatment for fluid overload has traditionally been achieved through use of loop diuretics which may be accompanied by use of other categories of medications, such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and inotropic drugs. Although diuretics are the mainstay of treatment for congestion or fluid overload, no randomized trials have shown the effects of diuretics on mortality in chronic heart failure patients. Furthermore, appropriate titration of diuretics, specifically in the heart failure population, is unclear. Increasing concern exists that diuretics, particularly at high doses, may be deleterious in the inpatient setting. In addition, patients with heart failure and cardiorenal syndrome have diminished response to loop diuretics, making these agents less effective at relieving congestion.4 Approximately 40% of heart failure patients have poor diuretic response.5 This poor response is possibly due to noncompliance or high intake of salt, poor drug absorption, insufficient kidney response to drug, and reduced diuretic secretion.6 Despite treatment with loop diuretics, patients are frequently hospitalized and treated for recurrent symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Among more than 50,000 patients enrolled in the ADHERE (Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry) study, only 33% lost ≥ 2.27 kg (5 lbs), and 16% gained weight during hospitalization.7
Nearly one-half of hospitalized patients with heart failure are discharged with residual fluid excess after receiving conventional diuretic therapies.8 Regardless of diuretic strategy, 42% of acutely decompensated heart failure subjects in the DOSE (Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation) trial reached the composite endpoint of death, rehospitalization, or emergency department visit at 60 days.9 There is an association of chronic loop diuretic therapy and greater resource utilization at hospitals.10 Therefore, an alternative therapy to help stabilize or improve patient care is needed.
 Ultrafiltration.
 Ultrafiltration, or aquapheresis, is an alternative therapy to diuretics for fluid removal in patients. Ultrafiltration has been a well-documented technique in the treatment of fluid overload in heart failure patients for 25-30 years.11 Ultrafiltration is a safe and effective alternative therapy to remove extra fluid and salt by gently filtering blood through an ultrafiltration system. With ultrafiltration, medical practitioners can specify and control the amount of fluid to be extracted at a safe, predictable, and effective rate. The use of ultrafiltration therapy in subgroups of patients, such as heart failure and post-cardiac surgery, has demonstrated clinical benefits in treating fluid overload signs and symptoms. In addition to the clinical benefits of ultrafiltration, the therapy provides economic advantages. A recent hospital cost analysis demonstrated a total cost savings of $3,975, or 14.4%, per patient when using ultrafiltration as compared to diuretic therapy over 90 days.12The Aquadex FlexFlow System
 The Aquadex FlexFlow system is designed and clinically proven to simply, safely, and precisely remove excess fluid (primarily excess salt and water) from patients suffering from fluid overload who have failed diuretic therapy. With the Aquadex FlexFlow system, medical practitioners can specify and control the amount of fluid to be extracted at a safe, predictable, and effective rate. The Aquadex FlexFlow system has been shown to have no

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Aquadex Flex Flow blood circuit set is proprietary and the Aquadex FlexFlow system can only be used with the Aquadex blood circuit set. The dual lumen extended length catheter (dELC) is designed for use with the Aquadex FlexFlow system, although it is one of many potential catheter options available to the healthcare provider.
 Our Market Opportunity
 The Aquadex FlexFlow system is indicated for the treatment of patients suffering from fluid overload who have failed diuretics. We are currently focusing our commercial activities in two primary clinical areas where fluid overload is prevalent: heart failure and post-cardiac surgery.
Heart Failure
 Heart failure is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and other developed countries. In fact, approximately 50% of patients who develop heart failure die within five years of diagnosis. Based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Center for Health Statistics from 2011 to 2014, the American Heart Association estimates

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  that 6.5 million people in the United States, age 20 and over, had heart failure18. Based on the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study from 2005 to 2013, conducted by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, there are an estimated 960,000 new heart failure cases annually19. Annual hospitalizations for heart failure exceed one million in both the United States and Europe, and more than 90% are due to symptoms and signs of fluid overload20. In addition, approximately 68% of patients are discharged with sub-optimal results.21 As such, there are over 600,000 heart failure patients in the United States who might benefit from new technologies to treat fluid overload.
 Heart failure is a progressive disease caused by impairment of the left side of hearts ability to pump blood to the various organs of the body. Patients with heart failure commonly experience shortness of breath, fatigue, difficulty exercising and swelling of the legs. The heart becomes weak or stiff and enlarges over time, making it harder for the heart to pump the blood needed for the body to function properly. The severity of heart failure depends on how well a persons heart pumps blood throughout the body.
 According to a nationwide study of over 140,000 patients suffering from acute decompensated heart failure, over 38% of patients discharged were still symptomatic and about half of the patients were discharged with less than five pounds lost.22 This clinical evidence from the ADHERE Registry clearly shows patients are discharged too early, while still showing evidence of fluid overload. 
 By not truly addressing the fluid overload problem, patients are being readmitted to the hospital too frequently, with 30-day readmissions of 22% and 6-month readmissions of 44%, while 78% of patients are admitted directly to the Emergency Department as the first point of care.23 24
 Heart failure often requires inpatient treatment and it carries a huge economic burden in the United States, costing the nation an estimated $60.2 billion each year with hospital costs accounting for 62% of the economic burden.25 As the population ages, healthcare expenditures are expected to increase substantially.26 Therefore, therapies aimed at treating congestion and fluid overload is essential from a patient care and health economic perspective.
 Patients suffering from heart failure may receive ultrafiltration therapy in two settings: (i) inpatient care: provided to a patient admitted to a hospital, extended care facility, nursing home or other longer-term care facility; and (ii) outpatient care: provided to a patient who is not admitted to a facility, but receives treatment at a doctors office, clinic, or hospital outpatient department.
 Hospitals in the United States also face potential penalties for heart failure readmissions. As part of the Affordable Care Act of 2012, Medicare instituted the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), which penalizes hospitals with high 30-day readmission rates for heart failure and other common diseases and procedures. This penalty can be as high as 3% of reimbursement for all Medicare admissions. Technologies that help reduce readmissions, such as the Aquadex FlexFlow system, can help hospitals mitigate these penalties.
 Post-Cardiovascular Surgery
 Cardiac surgeries are commonly performed throughout the world. According to the National Center for Health Sciences, over 7.3 million cardiovascular operations are performed each year in the United States, including an estimated 340,000 coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures27, 180,000 valve procedures28, and 3,000

  ventricular assist device (VAD) implants29. Cardiac surgery is associated with a degree of fluid overload due to cardio pulmonary bypass. Cardio pulmonary bypass often requires a physician to administer a high volume of pre- and post-operative fluids (e.g. cardio pulmonary bypass pumps prime fluid, fluid used for cardioplegia, other fluids administered to address hypotension or post-operative crystalloid). Fluid overload in post-cardiac surgery can readily occur because surgery can affect the pumping actions of the heart, leading to postoperative hemodynamic instability. The condition often remains symptomless for several days until clinical symptoms become apparent, when treatment is almost always too late and ineffective.30
The potential complications (e.g. renal failure, stroke, infection, arrhythmias, or prolonged intubation) are reported to be associated with high mortality, particularly when renal replacement therapy is required. Major complications after cardiac operations are associated with an increased risk for operative death, longer hospital length of stay, and higher rates of discharge to a location other than home.31 Readmissions are a common problem in cardiac surgery and remain high. Approximately 20% of patients who undergo cardiac operations require readmission, an outcome with significant health economic implications. Volume overload was among the top three most prevalent causes for first readmission within 30 days and beyond 30 days.32 It is estimated that 13.5% of post cardiac surgery patients are readmitted due to fluid overload within 30 days of discharge, which equates to an estimated 70,000 fluid overload-related readmissions for CABG, valve, and VAD procedures per year in the United States.33
In addition to reducing readmissions, we believe that managing the patients fluid shortly after cardiac surgery may lessen the time that a patient is in the intensive care unit, allowing the patient to transfer to a more comfortable and less expensive area of the hospital.
 Our Strategy
 Our mission is to predict, measure, and control patient fluid balance through science, collaboration, innovative medical technology, and education. We provide healthcare professionals with a sophisticated, yet easy to use, mechanical pump and filter system to remove excess fluid in fluid overloaded patients. We believe that our technology will provide a competitive advantage in the fluid management market by providing improved clinical benefits and reducing the cost of care relative to other treatment alternatives.
 Our strategic focus is to demonstrate a strong business model by driving revenue growth. Growing revenue is the key metric employees, shareholders and potential investors will use to judge our performance. Since the acquisition, we have focused our marketing efforts in heart failure patients suffering from fluid overload in the inpatient setting and for the last seven quarters have experienced double-digit year over year revenue growth. During this time, we expanded our field-based employees which includes both sales representatives and clinical specialists and currently have thirteen sales territories in the US, as well as distribution agreements in several countries in Europe and Asia. In 2019, we will continue to focus on heart failure patients in the inpatient setting while expanding to other clinical areas such as heart failure in the outpatient setting and addressing fluid overload in the post-cardiac surgery setting; and, if we receive clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, we intend to expand our commercialization efforts to treatments for pediatric patients.
 Heart Failure In-Patients: Heart failure patients suffering from fluid overload may be treated in an inpatient setting, such as a hospital, extended care facility or nursing home. Historically, our commercial efforts have been primarily focused on use of the Aquadex FlexFlow system in the inpatient setting in large hospital accounts. We intend to continue to focus our sales efforts on inpatient facilities, leveraging the clinical benefits and economic advantages of using the Aquadex FlexFlow system over diuretic therapy.
 Heart Failure Out-Patients: Further, we intend to expand the use of the Aquadex FlexFlow system with heart failure patients in the outpatient setting, such as a clinic or hospital outpatient department (e.g. observation unit). While currently not reimbursed by Medicare and private payors, outpatient clinics are still using the Aquadex

  FlexFlow system to treat patients suffering from fluid overload because it can be a financial benefit to use the Aquadex FlexFlow system without reimbursement rather than to incur Medicare penalties for readmission into the inpatient setting. We are supporting the development of new evidence regarding the economic impact of ultrafiltration in the outpatient setting, including a clinical study on outpatient use that is expected to be initiated by the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Tampa, Florida in the second quarter of 2019. We plan to use such new evidence to seek reimbursement and gain broader adoption of the Aquadex FlexFlow system in the outpatient market.
 Post Cardio Vascular Surgery: At the end of the third quarter of 2018, we launched a marketing campaign focused on the benefits of the Aquadex FlexFlow system in treating patients suffering from fluid overload following cardiac surgery procedures, such as CABG, valve repairs and replacements procedures, VAD implants and other cardiac surgical procedures. We plan to continue to focus our expanded efforts in this therapeutic area to grow revenue, leveraging the synergies between heart failure cardiologists and cardiovascular surgeons, traditional technology adoption rates of cardiac surgeons, and product purchase cycle of the cardiac surgical centers at large hospitals.
 Pediatrics: We intend to seek modification of the product label contained in the 510(k) clearance for our Aquadex FlexFlow system to allow commercial promotion in pediatric patients. Currently, our Aquadex FlexFlow system is not recommended for use in pediatric patients. Therefore, we do not devote commercialization resources toward, nor promote, the use of the Aquadex FlexFlow system in pediatric patients. However, based on their clinical expertise and medical judgement, physicians are permitted to prescribe the Aquadex FlexFlow system for use in pediatric patients. We believe that Aquadex FlexFlow system is currently being prescribed by physicians to treat various conditions in pediatric patients, including heart failure, cardiac surgery34, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy35, solid organ transplantation36, and kidney replacement therapy for neonatal patients. While incidence data is not readily available, it is estimated that there are approximately 10,000 to14,000 pediatric patients with heart failure37 and approximately 18,000 receiving cardiac surgery, ECMO therapy, and solid organ transplantation. 38, 39, 40 We plan to begin discussions with the FDA in the first half of 2019 regarding a modification to the product label and expect to submit for a modification to our 510(k) clearance by the end of the second quarter of 2019. If we submit for such modification by the end of the second quarter, we believe that we will receive 510(k) clearance from the FDA by the end of 2019. It is possible that the FDA requires additional testing prior to clearance of the modification to our indication for pediatric use or does not clear the modification at all. If we receive FDA clearance for an update to the product label, we intend to expand our commercialization efforts to include promotion to physicians and hospitals who treat this pediatric population.
 Outside of the United States, we plan to continue to establish partnerships for the distribution of the Aquadex FlexFlow system. We currently have distribution relationships in Brazil, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Singapore, Spain, Thailand and the United Kingdom.
 Besides driving near term revenue growth through sales of the Aquadex FlexFlow system, we intend to develop product enhancements to improve performance and customer satisfaction. We have projects designed to improve venous access for the Aquadex FlexFlow catheter and enhance the functionality of the hematocrit sensor that is part of the Aquadex FlexFlow console. We also are collaborating with partners to evaluate diagnostic tools for physicians to use during an aquapheresis therapy to more precisely determine the amount of excess fluid to be removed, the rate of ultrafiltration, and when to stop therapy as dry weight is approached.
 Sales and Marketing
 As of February 15, 2019, we had 24 full-time employees in sales and marketing. Our U.S. sales force includes therapy development managers as well as field clinical specialists who provide training, technical and other support services to our customers.

  Inc. (Baxter) in August 2016, our direct sales force was focused on re-engaging hospital accounts that ordered Aquadex FlexFlow blood sets in prior years, re-educating customers on the therapy, and assessing each hospitals use of the Aquadex FlexFlow system to gain additional opportunity for increased utilization. In 2018, we expanded our focus to engage customers who have not previously used the Aquadex FlexFlow system and to market our product for use in post-cardiac surgery. We have grown the sales and marketing organization as necessary to support this growth.
 In the United States, our target customers for the Aquadex FlexFlow system include health care systems and academic hospitals specializing in advanced treatment of chronic heart failure and/or cardiac surgery, other hospitals with heart failure related admissions and/or who perform cardiac surgery operations and clinical practices with heart failure or cardiac surgery programs. Our largest customer, Mount Sinai Hospital, represented 10.1% of our 2018 annual revenue. The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our revenue.
 Outside of the United States, our Aquadex FlexFlow system is sold by independent specialty distributors who in turn sell to hospitals and clinics in their geographic regions. We currently have distribution relationships in Brazil, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Singapore, Spain, Thailand and the United Kingdom. We intend to continue to establish distribution partners in additional countries outside of the United States.
 Clinical Experience
 Several large-scale, multi-center, randomized, controlled trials have evaluated the use of ultrafiltration using the Aquadex FlexFlow system patients in patients with acute decompensated heart failure compared to standard-of-care treatment with intravenous diuretics. These trials followed early-stage studies which primarily focused on safety of ultrafiltration treatment with the Aquadex FlexFlow system.
 The UNLOAD trial enrolled 200 patients and showed that average weight and fluid loss were greater in the ultrafiltration group 48 hours following randomization. No differences were noted in symptoms of dyspnea between the groups. In addition, through 90 days of follow-up, the ultrafiltration group experienced fewer re-hospitalizations for heart failure, while renal function assessed by serum creatinine level was not significantly different between the groups.
 The CARRESS trial studied 188 randomized acute decompensated heart failure patients over the course of 96 hours and found no difference in weight loss and an increase in creatinine level relative to the control group treated with intravenous diuretics. The creatinine increase was interpreted as a sign of potential worsening renal function in the ultrafiltration group. Results of CARRESS have been criticized on several grounds, particularly that trial results were impacted by centers unfamiliar with the use of ultrafiltration therapy and that the diuretic regimen employed was not representative of standard-of-care. In addition, a recent analysis of the DOSE trial to explore the putative link between short-term changes in creatinine level and outcome in acute decompensated heart failure has found that the intragroup difference observed in CARRESS does not fall into a range associated with adverse long-term outcomes including death, re-hospitalization or visits to the emergency department. Such events were examined in CARRESS over 60 days and no differences were detected between the groups.
 Disparate results between UNLOAD and CARRESS led to initiation of the AVOID-HF trial. AVOID-HF was designed to prospectively address the question of patient outcomes when treated with ultrafiltration versus intravenous diuretics for acute decompensated heart failure. Trial design assumptions indicated that 810 patients would need to be randomized to achieve adequate statistical power. However, the study was terminated at 224 patients for business reasons by Baxter. Despite being underpowered, the results of AVOID-HF indicated distinct trends toward reduced composite heart-failure events in the ultrafiltration group over 90 days. In addition, pre-specified secondary endpoints demonstrated significant reductions in heart failure re-hospitalization at 30 days. No significant differences were observed in creatinine level between the groups, although a trend toward increase may have been present at 48 hours. In totality, AVOID-HF recapitulated the results of both UNLOAD and CARRESS while providing evidence that had AVOID-HF been followed to completion it would likely have met its primary endpoint of improved outcome in acute decompensated heart failure patients.
 We anticipate conducting additional clinical studies to provide further evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the Aquadex FlexFlow system and to support obtaining a specific reimbursement code for aquapheresis therapy.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Other uses of ultrafiltration with the Aquadex FlexFlow system have not been studied extensively. Case studies and case series demonstrating the use of ultrafiltration in the maintenance of outpatient heart failure have been published, but there has been no prospective, systematic evaluation of ultrafiltration versus standard-of-care for this population. Other potential uses also largely remain to be formally evaluated.
Research and Development
 Research and development costs include activities related to research, development, design, and testing improvements to the Aquadex FlexFlow system and potential related products. The Aquadex FlexFlow system software will require periodic modifications for feature additions and performance improvements. We will make such design changes as needed based on pro-active and reactive mechanisms. Research and development costs also include expenses related to clinical research. Currently, we have projects designed to improve venous access for the Aquadex FlexFlow catheter and enhance the functionality of the hematocrit sensor that is part of the Aquadex FlexFlow console. We also are evaluating diagnostic tools for physicians to use during an aquapheresis therapy to more precisely determine the amount of excess fluid to be removed, the rate of ultrafiltration, and when to stop therapy as dry weight is approached. These diagnostic tools include the AcQtrac™ System, which we acquired in August 2018, and diagnostic tools marketed by Daxor Corporation (Daxor) and NI Medical, Inc. In the second half of 2019, we intend to conduct a clinical evaluation of Daxor's BVA-100 and the Aquadex FlexFlow system, and if successful, we may initiate a co-marketing arrangement with Daxor in the second half of 2019. In the future, we may sponsor or conduct additional clinical research related to the Aquadex FlexFlow system to enhance understanding of the product and its use.
Manufacturers and Suppliers
 In connection with the acquisition of the Aquadex FlexFlow business (herein referred to as the Aquadex Business), we entered into a commercial manufacturing and supply agreement with Baxter, which required Baxter to manufacture Aquadex FlexFlow blood circuit sets and Aquadex FlexFlow catheters for a period of 18 months following our acquisition of the Aquadex Business. In May 2017, we notified Baxter that we intended to have it cease the manufacturing Aquadex product effective as of June 30, 2017. We completed the transfer of manufacturing equipment for the Aquadex Business that we purchased from Baxter to our manufacturing facility in July 2017. We began manufacturing Aquadex FlexFlow consoles and blood circuits in-house in the fourth quarter of 2017 and Aquadex FlexFlow catheters in-house in the third quarter of 2018. With the initiation of internal catheter production, we have completed the transfer of all manufacturing activities of the Aquadex FlexFlow system from Baxter.
Intellectual Property
 We have established an intellectual property portfolio through which we seek to protect our system and technology. In connection with our acquisition of the Aquadex Business, we entered into a patent license agreement with Baxter pursuant to which we obtained, for no additional consideration, a world-wide license to 49 exclusively licensed and 9 non-exclusively licensed patents used in connection with the Aquadex FlexFlow system to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import, the Aquadex FlexFlow system in the field of use. The license is exclusive, with respect to some patents, and non-exclusive, with respect to other patents. Under the patent license agreement, Baxter has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to continue maintenance of seven required maintenance patents, and we have agreed to reimburse Baxter for all fees, costs, and expenses (internal or external) incurred by Baxter in connection with such continued maintenance. The rights granted to us under the patent license agreement will automatically revert to Baxter in the event we cease operation of the Aquadex Business or we file for, have filed against us, or otherwise undertake any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, or other similar proceeding. For two years following the closing, the patent license agreement is not assignable by us (including in connection with a change of control) without Baxters prior written consent. We estimate that the patents licensed from Baxter will expire between approximately 2020 and 2025. In December 2018, we filed two patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. One application is based on our design for a wearable device designed to assist in maintaining peripheral venous blood flow access in the arm during aquapheresis treatment with the Aquadex FlexFlow system. The second application includes multiple potential new features and improvements to the diagnostic capabilities of the Aquadex FlexFlow system, which, if incorporated into the product, would be designed to help patient fluid balance and to improve usability for healthcare providers.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  In addition, as of February 15, 2019, we owned 36 issued patents and two pending patent applications in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions related to our C-Pulse System and had one pending application for neuromodulation. We estimate that most of our currently issued U.S. patents will expire between approximately 2021 and 2027. Given the strategic refocus away from C-Pulse and towards the Aquadex FlexFlow system, we have chosen to limit the maintenance of issued C-Pulse related patents to those innovations that are of the highest value. Further, we have elected to emphasize a few of the most critical jurisdictions rather than maintain the earlier approach that involved multiple countries. Our pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that will provide us any financial return. Even if issued, existing or future patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to obtain commercial benefits from them.
 We have developed technical knowledge that, although non-patentable, we consider to be significant in enabling us to compete. It is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with each of our employees and consultants prohibiting the disclosure of any confidential information or trade secrets. In addition, these agreements provide that any inventions or discoveries by employees and consultants relating to our business will be assigned to us and become our sole property.
 Despite our patent rights and policies with regard to confidential information, trade secrets and inventions, we may be subject to challenges to the validity of our patents, claims that our system infringes the patent rights of others and the disclosure of our confidential information or trade secrets. These and other risks are described more fully under the heading Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Intellectual Property.
 At this time we are not a party to any material legal proceedings that relate to patents or proprietary rights.
 Competition
 Competition from medical device companies and medical device divisions of health care companies, pharmaceutical companies and gene- and cell-based therapies is intense and expected to increase. The vast majority of patients with fluid overload receive pharmacological treatment (diuretics) as a standard of care. There are no direct competitors for the Aquadex FlexFlow system in the U.S., other than diuretics. Other systems, such as Baxters Prismaflex, a filter-based device that is approved for continuous renal replacement therapy for patients weighing 20kg or more with acute renal failure and/or fluid overload, represent indirect competitors, as they can also be used to conduct ultrafiltration.
 Our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to demonstrate the advantages of ultrafiltration as compared to diuretics, a pharmacological treatment that is currently the standard of care. In addition, we need to distinguish Aquadex FlexFlow system from the indirect competition of other devices that can also be used to conduct ultrafiltration.
 Third-Party Reimbursement
 In the United States, the Aquadex FlexFlow products are purchased primarily by customers, such as hospitals or other health care providers. Customers bill various third-party payers for covered Aquadex FlexFlow services provided to patients. These payers, which include federal health care programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), state health care programs, private health insurance companies, and managed care organizations, then reimburse our customers based on established payment formulas that take into account part or all of the cost associated with these devices and the related procedures performed.
 While the agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has not issued a favorable national coverage determination under its Investigational Device Exception Studies Program for ultrafiltration using the Aquadex FlexFlow system, a number of private insurers have approved reimbursement for Aquadex FlexFlow products use for specific indications and points of service. In addition, patients and providers may seek insurance coverage on a case-by-case basis. We are exploring the ability to increase the range of coverage for uses of Aquadex FlexFlow therapies, such as use in the outpatient setting and other indicated uses under its approved labeling.
 Legislative proposals can substantially change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers and may negatively impact payment rates for our system. Also, from time to time, there are a number of legislative, regulatory and other proposals both at the federal and state levels that may impact payment rates for our system. It remains uncertain whether there will be any future changes that will be proposed or finalized and

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  what effect, if any, such legislation or regulations would have on our business. However, in the United States and international markets, we expect that both government and third-party payers will continue to attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care by challenging the prices charged, or deny coverage, for health care products and services.
Government Regulations
 Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and foreign countries is a significant factor in the manufacture and marketing of our current system and any future products and in our ongoing research and development activities. In particular, medical devices are subject to rigorous preclinical testing as a condition of approval by the FDA and by similar authorities in foreign countries. Any proposed products will require regulatory approval prior to commercialization.
United States
 The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act) and the FDAs implementing regulations govern medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post market surveillance. Medical devices and their manufacturers are also subject to inspection by the FDA. The FDC Act, supplemented by other federal and state laws, also provides civil and criminal penalties for violations of its provisions. We manufacture and market medical devices that are regulated by the FDA, comparable state agencies and regulatory bodies in other countries.
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization are premarket notification (also called 510(k) clearance) and premarket approval (PMA). The type of marketing authorization applicable to a device—510(k) clearance or PMA—is generally linked to classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the extent of control deemed necessary to ensure the devices safety and effectiveness. Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices are deemed to pose the least risk and are subject only to general controls applicable to all devices, such as requirements for device labeling and adherence to the FDAs current good manufacturing practice requirements, as reflected in its Quality System Regulation (QSR). Class II devices are intermediate risk devices that are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or post market surveillance. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls, and include life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, and devices not substantially equivalent to a device that is already legally marketed.
 Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior authorization from FDA. Class I and Class II devices that have not been exempted are eligible for marketing through the 510(k) clearance pathway. By contrast, devices placed in Class III generally require PMA prior to commercial marketing. The PMA process is generally more stringent, time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) clearance process.
 510(k) Clearance. To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device legally marketed in the United States. A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics or (ii) different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data. Generally, the 510(k) clearance process can exceed 90 days and may extend to a year or more.
 After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any modification to that device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or which results in major change to the intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA (if the device as modified is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate

  device). The determination as to whether new authorization is needed is initially left to the manufacturer; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
 The Aquadex FlexFlow system was granted FDA 510(k) clearance for commercial use on June 3, 2002. Additional 510(k) clearances have been received for the Aquadex FlexFlow system in subsequent years.
 Clinical Trials. To obtain FDA approval to market certain devices, clinical trials may be required to support a PMA application. We previously were conducting clinical trials for the C-Pulse System that were halted. We are currently not conducting any clinical trials; however, it is possible that we may need to conduct clinical trials in the future if we develop enhancements to, or expand the approved indication of, the Aquadex FlexFlow system or we acquire additional products that require a clinical trial. Clinical trials generally require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to the FDA prior to commencing the trial. FDA approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward, but does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the products safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
 All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with regulations and requirements collectively known as Good Clinical Practice. Good Clinical Practices include the FDAs IDE regulations, which describe the conduct of clinical trials with medical devices. They also prohibit promotion, test marketing or commercialization of an investigational device and any representation that such a device is safe or effective for the purposes being investigated. Good Clinical Practices also include the FDAs regulations for institutional review board approval and for protection of human subjects (such as informed consent), as well as disclosure of financial interests by clinical investigators. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA
 The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product. The commencement or completion of any clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application or clearance of a premarket notification for numerous reasons. 
 Continuing Regulation. After a device is cleared or approved for use and placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 
• | establishment registration and device listing upon the commencement of manufacturing;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during medical device design and manufacturing processes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or off-label uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and promotional activities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if malfunctions were to recur;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDC Act caused by the device that may present a risk to health.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the FDA may require a company to conduct post market surveillance studies or order it to establish and maintain a system for tracking its products through the chain of distribution to the patient level.
 Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those applicable to the conduct of clinical trials, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions:
 
• | warning letters or untitled letters;
--+-------------------------------------


• | fines, injunctions and civil penalties;
--+----------------------------------------


• | product recall or seizure;
--+---------------------------

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  
• | unanticipated expenditures;
--+----------------------------


• | delays in clearing or approving or refusal to clear or approve products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawal or suspension of FDA approval;
--+------------------------------------------


• | orders for physician notification or device repair, replacement or refund;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production or clinical trials; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

 We and our contract manufacturers and suppliers are also required to manufacture our products in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements set forth in the QSR. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing and record keeping. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors. If the FDA believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers is not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to clear or approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees. Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business.
 European Union
 In order to import and sell our products in member countries of the European Union, or EU, medical devices currently must comply with the essential requirements of the European Union Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC). Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the Conformité Européene, or CE, Mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in the EU. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the European Union Medical Devices Directive, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body, an organization accredited by a member state of the EU to conduct conformity assessments. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body would typically audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices. The Notified Body issues a certificate of conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the essential requirements. This certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE Mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity.
 Recently, the European Union replaced the Medical Devices Directive (93/42/EEC) (MDD) with the new European Medical Devices Regulation, or MDR. The MDR will apply after a transitional period of three years ending on May 26, 2020. Manufacturers have the duration of the transition period to update their technical documentation and processes to meet the new requirements in order to obtain a CE Mark or to issue a EC Declaration of Conformity. After May 26, 2020, medical devices can still be placed on the market under the provision of the MDD or the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive (AIMDD) 90/385/EEC (hereafter referred to together as MDD/AIMDD) until May 27, 2024; provided the CE Mark was issued prior to this date, the manufacturer continues to comply with either one of the directives, and that no significant changes are made in the design and intended purpose of the applicable medical device. By May 27, 2024, all medical devices entering the EU will need to have a new CE Mark under the MDR, even if they have been on the market previously under the MDD/AIMDD.
 The CE Mark for Aquadex FlexFlow system has expired and, therefore, we currently cannot import new units of the Aquadex FlexFlow system into the EU. We currently are seeking renewal of the CE Mark, which we expect to receive by the latter half of 2019. It is possible that the conformity assessment conducted by our notified body will be under the MDR. We believe that we will be able to meet the requirements of the MDR; however, it is 

 
 12


 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  possible that we may not be able to meet all of the requirements of this new regulation without additional testing. While we believe that we currently have sufficient product inventory already available for sale in the EU market and the timing of the receipt of the CE Mark will not have a material impact on our revenue, a delay in receipt of the CE Mark could cause a shortage in product availability in the EU.
Employees
 As of February 15, 2019, we had 55 full-time employees and no part-time employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider relations with our employees to be good.
Company History
 Prior to July 2016, we were focused on developing the C-Pulse Heart Assist System for treatment of Class III and ambulatory Class IV heart failure. In August 2016, we acquired the Aquadex Business from a subsidiary of Baxter. In September 2016, we announced a strategic refocus of our strategy that included halting all clinical evaluations of the C-Pulse related technology to fully focus our resources on our recently acquired Aquadex Business. On May 23, 2017, we announced that we were changing our name from Sunshine Heart, Inc. to CHF Solutions, Inc. to more appropriately reflect the direction of our business.
Corporate Information
 CHF Solutions, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on August 22, 2002. We began operating our business in November 1999 through Sunshine Heart Company Pty Limited, which currently is a wholly owned Australian subsidiary of CHF Solutions, Inc. Our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market (Nasdaq) on February 16, 2012.
