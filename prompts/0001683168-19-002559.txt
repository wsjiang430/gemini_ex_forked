ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
We are a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing and preparing to commercialize cellular therapies for cancer and diabetes based upon a proprietary cellulose-based live cell encapsulation technology known as “Cell-in-a-Box®.” The Cell-in-a-Box® technology is intended to be used as a platform upon which therapies for several types of cancer, including locally advanced, inoperable non-metastatic pancreatic cancer (“LAPC”) and Type 1 and insulin dependent Type 2 diabetes will be developed.
 
We are developing therapies for pancreatic and other solid cancerous tumors by using genetically engineered live human cells that are capable of converting a cancer prodrug into its cancer-killing form, encapsulating those cells using the Cell-in-a-Box® technology and placing those capsules in the body as close as possible to the tumor. In this way, when the cancer prodrug is administered to a patient with a particular type of cancer that may be affected by the prodrug, the killing of the patient’s tumor may be optimized.
 
We are also examining ways to exploit the benefits of the Cell-in-a-Box® technology to develop therapies for cancer that involve prodrugs based upon certain constituents of the Cannabis plant; these constituents are of the class of compounds known as “cannabinoids”.
 
In addition, we are involved in preclinical studies to determine if our cancer therapy can slow the production and/or accumulation of malignant ascites fluid in the abdomen that accompanies the growth of several types of abdominal cancers.
 
Finally, we are developing a therapy for Type 1 diabetes and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes based upon the encapsulation of a human liver cell line that has been genetically engineered to produce, store and secrete insulin at levels in proportion to the levels of blood sugar in the human body. We are also considering an alternative route to bringing a biological treatment for diabetes into human clinical trials. We are exploring the possibility of encapsulating human insulin-producing stem cells and islet cells and then transplanting them into a diabetic patient.
 
The encapsulation for each type of cell will be done using the Cell-in-a-Box® technology. Each approach is designed to function as a bio-artificial pancreas for the purpose of insulin production.
 
The Cell-in-a-Box® encapsulation technology potentially enables genetically engineered live human cells to be used as miniature factories. The technology results in the formation of pin-head sized cellulose-based porous capsules in which genetically modified live human cells can be encapsulated and maintained. In the laboratory setting, which involves the large-scale amplification and production of useful biotech products outside the body of a person or animal, the proprietary live cell encapsulation technology has been shown to create a micro-environment in which these encapsulated cells survive and flourish. They are protected from environmental challenges, such as the sheer forces associated with bioreactors, passage through catheters and needles, etc., enabling greater growth and production of the end-product. The capsules are largely composed of cellulose (cotton) and are bio-inert.
 
Cancer Therapy
 
Targeted Chemotherapy
 
Our live-cell encapsulation technology-based therapies consist of encapsulating different types of genetically modified living cells depending on the disease being treated. For our leading product candidate, a therapy for pancreatic cancer, approximately 20,000 genetically modified live cells that produce an enzyme (an isoform of cytochrome P450) which we believe will convert the chemotherapy prodrug ifosfamide into its cancer-killing form are encapsulated in porous, spherical, pinhead-sized capsules, composed largely of cellulose. Then approximately 300 of these capsules will be placed in the patients’ blood supply and guided into place using interventional radiography so that they finally reside as close to the tumor in the pancreas as possible. Low doses (one gram per square meter of body surface area of the patient) of the chemotherapy prodrug ifosfamide will then be given to the patient intravenously.

The prodrug ifosfamide is normally activated in the patient’s liver. By activating the prodrug near the tumor using the Cell-in-a-Box® capsules, our cellular therapy acts as a type of “bio-artificial liver.” Using this “targeted chemotherapy,” we are seeking to create an environment that enables optimal concentrations of the “cancer-killing” form of ifosfamide at the site of the tumor. Because the cancer-killing form of ifosfamide has a short biological half-life, we believe that this approach results in little to no collateral damage to other organs in the body. We also believe this treatment will significantly reduce tumor size with no treatment-related side effects.

This combination therapy will be the subject of a Phase 2b clinical trial we plan to conduct, subject to FDA approval. No regulatory authority has granted marketing approval for the Cell-in-a-Box® technology, the related encapsulated cells, or Cell-in-a-Box® and encapsulated cells plus low-dose ifosfamide combination.

Pancreatic Cancer Therapy
 
A critical unmet medical need exists for patients with LAPC whose pancreas tumor no longer responds after 4-6 months of treatment with either Abraxane® plus gemcitabine or the 4-drug combination known as FOLFIRINOX (both combinations are the current standards of care for pancreatic cancer). We believe that these patients have no effective treatment alternative once their tumors no longer respond to these therapies. Two of the most commonly used treatments for these patients are 5-fluorouiracil (“5-FU”) or capecitabine (a prodrug of 5-FU) plus radiation (chemoradiation therapy). We believe that both treatments are only marginally effective in treating the tumor and both result in serious side effects. More recently, radiation treatment alone is being used at some cancer centers in the United States (“U.S.”).
 
We believe that all of these treatments are only marginally effective in treating the tumor and all can result in serious side effects. Other treatments are being tried in an attempt to address this problem, but their success is far from certain. Therefore, we are developing a therapy comprised of Cell-in-a-Box® encapsulated live cells implanted near the pancreas tumor followed by the infusion of low doses of the cancer prodrug ifosfamide. We believe that our therapy can serve as a “consolidation therapy” that can be used with the current standards of care for LAPC and thus address this critical unmet medical need.
 
Subject to the FDA approval, we plan to commence a clinical trial involving patients with LAPC whose tumors have ceased to respond to either Abraxane® plus gemcitabine or FOLFIRINOX after 4-6 months. We had a Pre-Investigational New Drug Application meeting (“Pre-IND meeting”) with the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research of the FDA (“CBER”) in January 2017. At that Pre-IND meeting, the FDA communicated its agreement with certain aspects of our clinical development plan, charged us with completing numerous tasks and provided us with the guidance on the tasks we believe we need to complete for a successful IND, although no assurance could be given whether the FDA will approve our IND once it is submitted. The trial would initially take place in the U.S. with possible study sites in Europe at a later date.
 
Preparation of the Investigational New Drug Application
 
Before we can begin our clinical trial, we must submit an IND to the FDA. The IND consists of a submission of all available preclinical information (e.g. animal toxicity studies), Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”) information and other pre-clinical information about our product candidate to treat LAPC, as well as clinical information and other information and documentation required by the FDA. Facet Life Sciences (“Facet”) has been retained by us as our FDA regulatory affairs consultant and is leading the preparation of the IND.

During fiscal year 2019, we have focused our research and development (“R&D”) efforts at completing Cell-in-a-Box® encapsulation engineering runs and production runs successfully using cells from our Master Cell Bank (“MCB”) that contain the genetically transformed human cells that can activate the prodrug ifosfamide into its cancer killing form. The MCB encapsulated cells from the final manufacturing run will be used for our planned clinical trial in LAPC.  Several tests and experiments have been completed this past year to optimize the growth properties of the cells in the capsules. The data from these tests and experiments will be included in our IND.
 
In addition to the MCB work, we have completed a series of tests and studies on cells from the MCB and the capsules into which they will be placed. These tests and studies are required by the FDA. The data from these tests and studies will be included in our IND. The tests and studies consist of the following:
 
Completed Tests:
 
Polymerase Chain Reaction (“PCR”) Assay as Identity Test for Clinical Product: A PCR -based identity test as quality control of the 22P1G encapsulated cell product was developed by Austrianova. This assay was transferred from Austrianova to a certified service provider in Thailand who provided the assay to Austrianova Thailand.
Characterization Studies of the 22P1G Cell Line: These 22P1G studies consisted of pre-existing data and other data generated in experimental plans developed by Austrianova. These studies focused on: (i) the characterization of the 22P1G original cell line, including the subcloning, testing of PrestoBlue (cell viability) and resorufin (enzymatic) activities of the different clones and subclones, testing of PrestoBlue and resorufin activities of the different clones and subclones, southern blots and growth analysis of the subclones; (ii) adaption to serum free medium and testing of the best growth conditions prior to and after encapsulation; and (iii) genetic and phenotypic stability of the 22P1G cell line. The purpose of these studies is to document the key characteristics of the parental 22P1G cell line and the clones and subclones in order to demonstrate the stability of the 22P1G cell line before, during and after the encapsulation process. The data will be used in the IND submission to the FDA.
Cell Culture Medium Comparison Study: Due to availability concerns with the cell culture medium in which the 22P1G cells were developed, Austrianova undertook a cell culture medium comparison study. The study was undertaken in order to source and check a backup cell culture medium. The study concurrently tested a new serum free medium and the existing SFM4HEK293 (the medium in which the cell line was developed) in parallel under the same conditions to establish equivalency for supporting cell growth of the 22P1G cells in capsules.
 
Certificate of Analysis: The Certificate of Analysis (“COA”) for the preparation of the MCB from Eurofins Lancaster Laboratories, Inc. (“Eurofins”) has been accepted by Austrianova Singapore Pte Ltd (“Austrianova”), who will perform the Cell-in-a-Box® encapsulation in the manufacturing facility located Bangkok, Thailand and owned by Austrianova Thailand Pte Ltd (“Austrianova Thailand”). The COA was issued following a series of tests required before the cells could be accepted by Austrianova Thailand into its manufacturing facility.
 
Pig Study Report: This study report on the safety of instillation of the capsules in pigs has been completed and approved by Facet. The report is a summary of information and data from preclinical work completed by Dr. Matthias Löhr (“Dr. Löhr”) in preparation for the first clinical trial using our therapy for pancreatic cancer.
Site of Integration Study: This FDA required study characterized the site of integration and the structure of the integrated CMV CYP2B1 plasmid (hence CYP therapeutic transgene) into the genome of the 22P1G cell line being used for our planned clinical trial. The cell line is referred to as 22P1GSF because it can be grown in serum-free cell culture medium. The goal of the study was to show that the site of integration is not near to a cancer-causing gene as well as to identify and characterize PCR primers that could be used as an identity test for release of the product.
 
Next Generation Sequencing (“NGS”) followed by a robust and multi-faceted analysis of the data yielded could confirm that the cytochrome P450-2B1 transgene from the CMV-CYP plasmid transfection of HEK293 cells (to create the 22P1G cell line) resulted in the stable integration of plasmid sequences into a non-gene-coding region of human chromosome 9. Using the NGS sequence data, a Capture PCR protocol was tested in an attempt to fish-out products with identified chromosome 9 and plasmid sequences but this was not successful. Instead, a parallel strategy using PCR, designing of several rounds of primers and nested primers followed by primer walking sequencing was undertaken. After several progressive rounds of work, it was possible to obtain sequences confirming the integration site of the CMV-CYP plasmid in chromosome 9. The NGS data showed that all of the CMV-CYP plasmid sequences are present between positions 93,691,754 and 93,691,785 of chromosome 9 in the 22P1G genome but it was not possible to elucidate the entire structure (number and orientation of repeats) of the plasmid sequences in complete detail, most likely due to the plasmid being concatemerized in various orientations. Nevertheless, the CMV promotor region and the CYP2B1 gene was confirmed to be present at this location in chromosome 9 by the PCR work here and previous work by Austrianova with enzymatic assays and Southern blotting confirms this by also showing that the CYP gene is biologically functional.

Initial Two Testing of Alternative Methods and Reagents for Measuring Cell Numbers: This involved the required testing of various new assays, especially those directed at new DNA synthesis, to validate or modify Austrianova’s existing cell number metabolic activity assays. This testing was done at the request of the FDA to demonstrate cell numbers in the capsules and to determine cell viability. This testing program focused on developing several assays as appropriate and quantitative assays that are effective even at high cell densities.
Bench Thawing Study. The purpose of this study was to assess the stability of encapsulated 22P1G cells after hand thawing and subsequent exposure to room temperature. It involves testing the metabolic activity of the cells in the capsules after hand-unfreezing and placement at room temperature for varying lengths of time.
Capsule Cell Count Study:
 
This study is part of a larger objective (which also included a previous PrestoBlue study) aimed at testing alternative methods and reagents for measuring cell division and determining the numbers of cells in capsules. This involved the testing of various new assays, especially those aimed at new DNA synthesis, to validate or modify existing metabolic activity assays which indirectly determines cell number. This study is a consequence of the request of the FDA to demonstrate cell number in capsules as well as cell viability. The program focused on developing the Celltox Green and Decapsulation Cell Count assays as appropriate quantitative assays.
 
After extensive investigations it was concluded that the best method of estimating cell numbers inside the capsule is the Decapsulation Cell Count. Several issues remain unresolved with the Celltox Green assay, such as: (i) the disparity in peak cell numbers when compared with the Direct Cell count method; (ii) the plateauing of total cell numbers and drop in live cell numbers; (iii) the high standard error due to the low signal window required to keep within the linear range of the cell standard; and (iv) the large day-by-day fluctuation inherent in the method.
 
In contrast, the direct cell count method provided stable, consistent results with comparatively low standard errors and fluctuation. It also has the advantage of being a direct visualization method, which gives more confidence in the interpretation of the raw input data than either Celltox Green or Prestoblue assays. As a result of this project, not only the best method to be used was determined but also simultaneously allowed the creation of a final and robust standard operating procedure (“SOP”) which will now be transferred into an SOP for integration into the documentation system for use during the manufacturing procedure for quality control.
 
Final Testing of Alternative Methods and Reagents for Measuring Cell Numbers: A third testing alternative method and testing for reagents for measuring cell division were completed. This involved the testing of additional new assays directed at new DNA synthesis to validate or modify our existing cell number metabolic activity assays.
Manufacturing Process Testing: Following an initial manufacturing run, changes were made to parts of the manufacturing process being performed under current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) conditions at Austrianova’s manufacturing facility in Bangkok, Thailand. The data obtained from the encapsulation parameters of the manufacturing process itself indicated that the encapsulation portion of the process is fault-free and reproducible, which is a fundamental requirement of the FDA.
 
Experiments to Optimize the Growth of the Encapsulated Cells from the MCB: The cells from the MCB produced by Eurofins showed slightly different growth properties when compared to the cells from our Research Cell Bank (“RCB”) that were previously tested by Austrianova’s laboratories, a finding that is not unusual when a new cell bank is established. Although minor in nature, these different growth characteristics of the MCB cells initially affected many of the steps required for the overall production process of our clinical trial material called “CypCaps™,” necessitating counter-measures to re-align and restructure part of the production process. Several independent tests were conducted by Austrianova to test the effects of possible changes to the production process.
 
Experiments by Austrianova and Eurofins. Several experiments were conducted by Austrianova in its laboratory in Singapore. Based upon the results of those experiments, changes were incorporated into the manufacturing process at the manufacturing facility in Bangkok, Thailand. Those changes led to Austrianova’s successful encapsulation and growth of the live cells from the MCB which will be used in our therapy for pancreatic cancer. The growth components of the experiments that were done to see what changes should be made to the pre-encapsulation portion of the production process were conducted by Eurofins as well.

Completion of Technology Transfer: All of the manufacturing technology developed by Austrianova was documented according to cGMP standards and successfully transferred to Austrianova’s Thailand facility where the encapsulation of our clinical trial material will be done.
Encapsulation and Further Testing

We are in the process of conducting two additional and staggered manufacturing runs in order to maximize the chances for a successful IND submission, given the novelty and complexity of the manufacturing process. These runs are also required by cGMP Validation, Inc, the company who is taking responsibility for “releasing” the clinical trial material into the U.S.
 
Following the encapsulation process, numerous tests will be conducted by Austrianova to generate the data necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements for the IND. When Austrianova finishes its work, it will issue a COA for our encapsulated cell product that we believe will comply with the FDA requirements
 
Revised Trial Design
 
We have completed a redesign of our planned clinical trial from a registrational trial to a Phase 2b trial. To help with the redesign of our clinical trial in patients with LAPC we formed an Oncology Advisory Board (“Advisory Board”) with leading oncologists in the U.S. Members include Dr. James Abbruzzese (Duke University Medical Center), Dr. Alok Khorana (The Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine), Dr. Eileen O’Reilly (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center), Dr. Vincent Picozzi (Virginia Mason Medical Center), Dr. Margaret Tempero (University of California, San Francisco), Dr. Syma Iqbal (USC Keck School of Medicine, Norris Cancer Center) and Dr. Robert McWilliams (The May Clinic Rochester). Dr. Manuel Hidalgo (“Dr. Hidalgo”), the Principal Investigator for the LAPC trial and a consultant to our company, led these individuals in working with us to finalize the new trial design
Study Synopsis and Schedule of Assessments 
 
The Study Synopsis and Schedule of Assessments for the Phase 2b trial have been revised by our Clinical Trial Leadership Team (“CTLT”). The CTLT meets on a regular basis to advance our clinical development program for pancreatic cancer.
 
Members of the CTLT include Kenneth L. Waggoner (“Mr. Waggoner”), our Chief Executive Officer, President and General Counsel, Dr. Gerald W. Crabtree (‘Dr. Crabtree”), our Chief Operating Officer, Dr. Linda Sher (“Dr. Sher”), our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Löhr, the Chairman of our Medical and Scientific Advisory Board and a consultant to us, Dr. Hidalgo, a consultant to us and the Principal Investigator for the clinical trial in LAPC, Dr. Leonard Makowka, our Senior Strategic Advisor to the Chief Executive Officer and our Board of Directors (“Board”), Lisa Guttman of Practical Clinical (a company specializing in clinical trial planning and execution) who is our Director of Clinical Operations and Jason Mercer and then Maria Osaka, the Project Managers from Facet.
 
The purpose of the new study design is to investigate the efficacy and safety of CypCaps™ (genetically engineered human cells encapsulated using the Cell-in-a-Box® technology) in combination with low doses (1g/m2) ifosfamide as compared to chemoradiation therapy with capecitabine plus external beam radiation therapy (“EBRT”) or stereotactic body radiation therapy (“SBRT”) alone. The study population has been finalized and will consist of approximately 100 patients with LAPC.
 
CRO Selection Process Completed
 
The CTLT concluded its selection process for a Contract Research Organization (“CRO”) to conduct our clinical trial in LAPC. We selected Medpace, Inc. (“Medpace”) as our CRO. Medpace is an established and highly regarded full-service CRO with expertise in numerous therapeutic areas focused on supporting the biotech sector. It is a scientifically-driven organization with a dedicated in-house study team supported by outstanding experts to lead the way. Medpace has an extensive portfolio of successfully completed clinical trials, including those involving pancreatic cancer. In 2018, Medpace was ranked among the top 10 CROs in the world.

Cannabinoids to Treat Cancer
 
Numerous studies have demonstrated the anti-cancer effects of certain cannabinoids (constituents of Cannabis). Two of the most widely studied cannabinoids in this regard are tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) and cannabidiol (“CBD”). Cannabinoids are: (i) anti-proliferative (slow tumor growth); (ii) anti-metastatic (slow tumor spread); (iii) anti-angiogenic (slowing blood vessel development); and (iv) pro-apoptotic initiate programed cell death). In in vitro and in vivo models, the anti-cancer effects of cannabinoids are broad. They have been shown to apply to lung, brain, thyroid, lymphoma, liver, skin, pancreas, uterus breast and prostate cancers. In a review of 51 scientific studies, among other properties, it was observed that cannabinoids can regulate cellular signaling pathways critical for cell growth and survival. These properties indicate that cannabinoids could be useful in the treatment of cancer.
 
As of May 2019, 33 states and the District of Columbia have approved the use of Cannabis for medical purposes. A plethora of medical marijuana companies have emerged. Most of them are involved in the production and distribution of Cannabis in its various forms, such as liquid extracts and pills, and in Cannabis delivery systems, such as vapor pens. We believe we are one of the few companies that are focused on using cannabinoids for the treatment of specific diseases.
 
We have several competitors that are developing Cannabis-based treatments for cancer. GW Pharmaceuticals, PLC has an approved cannabinoid product for the treatment of multiple sclerosis spasticity and is developing a product portfolio to treat a variety of illnesses, including glioblastoma (brain cancer). Cannabis Science, Inc. is developing topical cannabinoid treatments for basal and squamous cell skin cancers and Kaposi’s sarcoma, and is exploring pre-clinical development of cannabinoid-based anti-cancer drugs in a collaborative agreement with the Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. OWC Pharmaceutical Research Corp. is developing Cannabis-based products targeting a variety of indications and has a collaborative agreement with an academic medical center in Israel to study the effects of cannabinoids on multiple myeloma (a cancer of plasma cells). Cannabis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing personalized anti-cancer and palliative Cannabis-based treatments aimed mainly at improving the cachexia, anorexia syndrome and quality-of-life issues that are often characteristic of patients with devastating diseases like cancer.
 
In contrast to the work being done by these companies, we plan to focus on developing specific therapies based on carefully chosen molecules rather than using complex Cannabis extracts. Our therapy will use the Cell-in-a-Box® technology in combination with genetically modified cell lines designed to activate cannabinoid molecules for the treatment of diseases and their related symptoms. Our initial target will be glioblastoma – a very difficult-to treat form of brain cancer.

In May 2014, we entered into a Research Agreement with the University of Northern Colorado (“UNC”). The goal of the ongoing research is to develop methods for the identification, separation and quantification of constituents of Cannabis, some of which are prodrugs, which may be used in combination with the Cell-in-a-Box® technology to treat cancer. Significant effort has been expended to establish accurate analytical methods to separate, identify and quantitate various cannabinoids; these methods have now been identified. Studies have also been undertaken using cannabinoids to identify the appropriate cell type that can best convert the selected cannabinoid prodrugs into metabolites with anticancer activity. Once identified, the genetically modified cells which are expected to produce the appropriate enzyme to convert that cannabinoid prodrug will be encapsulated using the Cell-in-a-Box® technology. The encapsulated cells and cannabinoid prodrugs identified by these studies will then be combined and used for future studies to evaluate their anticancer effectiveness.

In January 2017, we entered into a second Research Agreement with UNC. The goal of this ongoing research is to assess the synthesis of the patG gene and its incorporation into a vector, transfection of human embryonic kidney cells using this vector and assessment of cannabinoic acid decarboxylase activity.
 
During 2017, UNC identified an organism whose genome contains the genetic code for production of an enzyme capable of activating a cannabinoid prodrug into its active cancer-killing form. Our Cannabis Program now has two primary areas of focus. The first is confirming the anti-cancer activity of cannabinoids, such as THC and CBD, particularly in our main “target” tumor – glioblastoma. UNC’s research has confirmed that a purified cannabinoid showed a potent dose-dependent decrease in cell viability for various cancers, suggesting that this cannabinoid exhibits significant anti-proliferative effects (stops the growth of cancer cells). This activity has been demonstrated in brain (glioblastoma), pancreas, breast, lung, colon and melanoma cancer cells. The second area of focus is in finding an enzyme capable of converting an inactive, side-effect-free, cannabinoid prodrug into its active cancer-killing form. The research team at UNC has screened numerous cell lines and numerous enzymes. As result of this extensive work, an organism has been identified that has been confirmed to produce an enzyme capable of catalyzing the desired cannabinoid-prodrug-activating reaction.
 
The next step is to test the efficiency of the transfected cells in converting cannabinoid prodrugs into their active cancer-fighting forms. If the cells are suitably active, they would then be propagated to the point that they can be encapsulated using the Cell-in-a-Box® technology. Also, we will continue our analysis of other genes of interest that could be used in a similar way.
 
Clinically, targeted cannabinoid-based chemotherapy would be accomplished by implanting the encapsulated bio-engineered cells near the site of a tumor, along with administration of a cannabinoid prodrug which would become activated at the site of the tumor by an enzyme produced by the encapsulated cells. The end goal is better efficacy than existing therapies with few, if any, treatment related side effects.
 
Malignant Ascites Fluid Therapy
 
We are studying the development of a possible therapy to delay the production and accumulation of malignant ascites fluid that results from many types of abdominal tumors. Malignant ascites fluid is secreted by an abdominal tumor into the abdomen after the tumor reaches a certain stage of growth. This fluid contains cancer cells that can seed and form new tumors throughout the abdomen. As this ascites fluid accumulates in the abdominal cavity, it can cause gross swelling of the abdomen, severe breathing difficulties and extreme pain.
 
Once an abdominal tumor reaches a certain stage of development, it secretes malignant ascites fluid into the abdominal cavity. When that occurs, malignant ascites fluid must be removed by paracentesis on a periodic basis. This procedure is painful and costly. We know of no available therapy that prevents or delays the production and accumulation of malignant ascites fluid. We have been involved in eight preclinical studies conducted by Translational Drug Development (“TD2”), an early stage CRO specializing in oncology, to determine if the combination of Cell-in-a-Box® encapsulated cells plus low doses of ifosfamide can delay the production and accumulation of malignant ascites fluid. The data from these eight studies indicated that the treatment might play a role in malignant ascites fluid production and accumulation, but the conclusions were difficult to interpret with certainty. As a result, we plan to conduct another preclinical study in Germany to determine if our conclusions from the TD2 studies are valid. If the ninth study is successful, we plan to seek approval from the FDA to conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial in the U.S.
 
Diabetes Therapy
 
Diabetes
 
Diabetes is caused by insufficient availability of, or resistance to, insulin. Insulin is produced by the beta islet cells of the pancreas. Its function is to assist in the transport of sugar (glucose) in the blood to the inside of most types of cells in the body where it is used as a source of energy for those cells. In Type 1 diabetes, the islet cells of the pancreas have been destroyed, usually by an autoimmune reaction. Type 1 diabetics require daily insulin administration through injection or by use of an insulin pump. In Type 2 diabetes, the body does not use properly insulin that is produced by the pancreas. This means the body has become resistant to insulin produced by the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes can generally be controlled by diet and exercise in its early stages. But as time goes by, it may be necessary to use antidiabetic drugs to control the disease. However, over time these too may lose their effectiveness. Thus, even Type 2 diabetics may become insulin-dependent.

Diabetes Epidemic
 
Diabetes is one of the largest health problems in the world. In its 2016 Global Report on Diabetes, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) estimated that, by the end of 2014, 422 million people worldwide had the disease – 314 million more than in 1980. Approximately 8.5% of adults worldwide have diabetes. Approximately $825 billion is spent annually in the treatment of diabetes and related healthcare. Nearly 30 million people in the U.S. have diabetes. Diabetes and prediabetes cost the U.S. more than $32 billion per year. The worldwide market for diabetes treatment drugs alone is over $70 billion.
Efforts to Cure Diabetes
 
In an attempt to “cure” Type 1 diabetes, replacement of damaged pancreatic beta islet cells has been attempted. This involves transplantation of the entire pancreas or of its beta islet insulin-producing cells. In 2000, islet cells from human cadavers were transplanted into insulin-dependent diabetics in a clinical trial. In this clinical trial involving seven patients in Edmonton, Canada, each patient remained insulin-independent for one year. But high doses of immune-suppressive drugs were needed to accompany the transplantations to avoid rejection of the transplanted islet cells. Without immunosuppressive drugs, these patients would be at a high risk of infection by bacteria, viruses and fungi and open to the growth of cancerous tumors. Therefore, the administration of these immunosuppressive drugs was necessary throughout the remaining lifespan of the patients in the trial. Unfortunately, these drugs are not only expensive, but they are also associated with serious side effects that have required patients to cease long-term treatment with them. Worldwide, less than 1,000 people with Type 1 diabetes are known to have been transplanted with pancreatic islet cells from another human being.
 
To avoid the use of islet cells from human donors, encapsulated islet cells from pigs have been used. This type of interspecies transplantation is known as “xenotransplantation”. Drug regulatory authorities have been reluctant to approve the use of such interspecies transplantations. Also, other challenges with this approach include the potential for the body’s immune system to attack the transplanted cells. To protect the non-human cells from attack by the immune system of the human being, they have been encapsulated using forms of encapsulation technology that are different than the encapsulation technology we use. In those studies, the transplanted islet cells from pigs were surrounded by a porous capsule, typically made of alginate - a derivative of seaweed.
 
Efforts to translate this concept into a viable treatment for Type 1 diabetes have been plagued by poor survival of the transplanted islet cells. Furthermore, the integrity of capsules composed of alginate has been shown to degrade over time. This degradation allows for immune system cells to attack the transplanted pig islet cells and this, in turn, necessitates additional transplantations. Also, as the alginate “capsules” degrade, they themselves can elicit an immune response.
 
Different tubular and planar “chamber-type” immune-protective devices that contain islet cells are under development by several companies. Such devices are placed in the body where they can be retrieved and replaced if necessary. Tubular chambers have shown good biocompatibility, but they are subject to rupture, exposing the islets to immune system attack. They also require large numbers of islet cells. Planar chambers are more stable, but they can cause extensive foreign body reactions in the host resulting in fibrotic overgrowth of the chambers which can cause “death” of the encapsulated islet cells and thus overall transplant failure.
 
Among the most extensively researched immune-protective strategy is that which employs micro-capsules. They are relatively simple to manufacture, can be implanted into the body without major surgery and, depending on the nature of the encapsulation material, micro-encapsulated cells can be cryopreserved. Micro-encapsulated islet cells first appeared in 1994 when a diabetic patient, already receiving immunosuppressive drugs, was transplanted with these cells encapsulated in alginate and remained insulin-independent for nine months. However, 23 years and numerous clinical trials later, there are still no publicly reported cases of long-term insulin-independence in non-immune-suppressed diabetic patients receiving encapsulated pancreatic islet transplants.
 
A Bio-Artificial Pancreas for Diabetes
 
We are developing a therapy for Type 1 diabetes and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes based upon the encapsulation of a human liver cell line genetically engineered to produce, store and secrete insulin at levels in proportion to the levels of blood sugar in the human body. We are also considering an alternative route to bringing a biological treatment for diabetes into the clinic. We are exploring the possibility of encapsulating human insulin-producing stem cells and islet cells and then transplanting them into a diabetic patient.

All three types of cells will be encapsulated using the Cell-in-a-Box® encapsulation technology. After appropriate animal testing has been completed successfully, we will seek the FDA’s approval to transplant encapsulated insulin-producing cells into diabetic patients. The goal for these approaches is to develop a bio-artificial pancreas for purposes of insulin production for diabetics who are insulin-dependent.
 
Austrianova has already successfully encapsulated live pig pancreas islet insulin-producing cells using the Cell-in-a-Box® technology. We understand that the encapsulated cells were then given to the University of Graz and implanted into diabetic rats. In this one-time experiment, it was reported in a poster presentation that the rats’ blood glucose levels normalized by day seven and remained normal throughout the study period of approximately 150 days. However, when attempts were made at the University of Graz to repeat this study on its own (including the encapsulation process), those at the University of Graz were unsuccessful. It is believed that this lack of reproducibility was due to a lack of knowledge of Austrianova’s encapsulation technology and trade secrets that reside with the Cell-in-a-Box® encapsulation technology.
 
We believe that encapsulating genetically engineered human cells, genetically engineered stem cells and beta islet cells using the Cell-in-a-Box® cellulose-based encapsulation technology has numerous advantages over encapsulation of cells with other materials, such as alginate. The Cell-in-a-Box® capsules are composed largely of cellulose, which is a bio-inert material in the human body. Also, these capsules are robust and do not trigger any sort of immune or inflammatory response from the body. This allows the capsules to remain intact for long periods of time in the body, all the while protecting the living cells inside them from immune system attack. In earlier clinical studies, these capsules and the cells inside them have not caused any immune or inflammatory responses like those seen with alginate-encapsulated cells, and any fibrotic overgrowth that occurs with the Cell-in-a-Box® capsules is minimal to none.
 
Our Diabetes Program began with two of the most critical components of a biological diabetes therapy - a line of human cells which release insulin in response to the blood glucose level in their environment and a technology to protect the cells from an attack by the immune system once they are transplanted into a patient’s body to replace his or her own destroyed insulin-producing cells. This technology is the Cell-in-a-Box® encapsulation technology. The cells used are called Melligen cells. They are patent-protected and have been licensed to us by the University of Technology, Sydney (“UTS”).
 
Melligen cells are no ordinary insulin-producing cells. They stand out from the array of cells used and newly created cells to serve as a replacement for insulin-producing cells in diabetics. We believe Melligen cells are much more robust than intrinsic insulin-producing cells and withstand an attack by cell-toxic molecules that typically lead to the destruction of insulin-producing cells.
 
Regulations for the use of living cells as a medical product require that the potential of the cells to grow and form a tumor in a patient be assessed. This so-called “tumorigenicity study” has been completed successfully by our International Diabetes Consortium. Melligen cells showed very low tumorigenicity – the level one would expect to pass regulatory scrutiny.
 
Putting Melligen cells and the Cell-in-a-Box® technology together, we conducted the first functional study in diabetic mice. The results did not meet our expectations. We discovered that, contrary to what we had expected and what we had read in published scientific papers on the Melligen cells published by UTS, the cells are not stable. With extensive testing and experiments, we discovered that the Melligen cells lose some of their specific beneficial properties over time.
 
Because of the advantages we felt the Melligen cells have over other competing therapies for diabetes, we made the decision to recreate the Melligen cells and to include a few needed improvements. To minimize the delay in the development of our Diabetes Program caused by the challenges encountered from the Melligen cells, we opened an additional, alternative route to bring a biological treatment for diabetes into the clinic. Concurrently with the recreation of functioning Melligen cells, we are exploring the possibility of encapsulating genetically modified stem cells and human insulin-producing pancreatic beta islet cells and then transplanting them into diabetic patients.
 
The first step in examining the feasibility of such an approach is an animal experiment using insulin-producing islet cells from one animal -- encapsulating them -- and then transplanting them into another animal. We plan to conduct preclinical studies at the University of Veterinary Medicine (“VetMed”), Vienna, Austria where Dr. Günzburg is a Professor. An encapsulation machine has been put into place at the VetMed, and the first live-cell encapsulation at the site was conducted successfully.
 
Recently we reached an agreement with UTS to enter into a new research agreement to create an advanced version of the Melligen cells for the treatment of diabetes. Under the new research agreement, which is in the process of being prepared, improvements will be made to the Melligen cells that we expect will increase their stability, increase their insulin production and increase the bioactivity of the produced insulin.

Prof. Ann Simpson, who created the Melligen cells, and her team of research scientists at UTS will be conducting this new research project. Dr. Eva Marie Brandtner (“Dr. Brandtner”), our Director of Diabetes Program Development, will also be involved in the research project.
 
International Diabetes Consortium
 
We have established an international Diabetes Consortium (“Consortium”). The Consortium consists of world-renowned physicians and scientists from several countries around the globe, all of whom share the same goal of developing a therapy for Type 1 and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes.
 
In addition to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Officer, the Consortium is made up of well-known physicians and scientists from leading Universities in Munich, Germany, Mannheim, Germany, Vienna, Austria, Barcelona, Spain, Copenhagen, Denmark and Sydney, Australia. It also includes members from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, the Vorarlberg Institute for Vascular Investigation and Treatment (“VIVIT”) in Feldkirch, Austria and Austrianova in Singapore.
 
Dr. Brandtner, Head of the Bioencapsulation Unit at VIVIT, leads the Consortium and is our Director of Diabetes Program Development. Dr. Brandtner previously served as the Chief Scientist with Austrianova and is an expert in the use of the Cell-in-a-Box® encapsulation technology.
 `
 Relationship between PharmaCyte, S.G. Austria and Austrianova
 
The principal developers of the Cell-in-a-Box® technology are Prof. Dr. Walter H. Günzburg (“Prof. Günzburg”) and Dr. Brian Salmons (“Dr. Salmons”). Both are officers of SG Austria Pte. Ltd. (“SG Austria”) and its wholly-owned subsidiary Austrianova. The success of SG Austria and Austrianova, on the one hand, and our success, on the other hand, are co-dependent in almost every respect. SG Austria and Austrianova benefit from our success. If we sublicense our encapsulation technology for the development of therapies for cancer and diabetes, payments are owed by us to SG Austria or Austrianova. In turn, we are dependent upon SG Austria and Austrianova because of the knowledge and expertise of Prof. Günzburg and Dr. Salmons concerning the Cell-in-a-Box® technology and the actual process of cell encapsulation. This technology serves as the basis for all our efforts in developing treatments for both cancer and diabetes. In addition, we own a 14.5% equity interest in SG Austria and have contractual relationships, including license agreements, with SG Austria and Austrianova.
 
Key Consultants
 
Prof. Günzburg and Dr. Salmons are involved in numerous aspects of the scientific endeavors relating to our Cancer and Diabetes Programs, having initially commenced work for us as consultants at the beginning of 2014 under an oral agreement. They provide services to us as consultants through their consulting company, Vin-de-Bona Trading Company Pte Ltd (“Vin-de-Bona”). This arrangement was formalized in writing as of April 1, 2014, when we entered a Consulting Agreement with Vin-de-Bona (“Vin-de-Bona Consulting Agreement”). The Vin-de-Bona Consulting Agreement had an initial term of 12 months, with additional terms of 12 months automatically renewing unless either party terminates an additional term upon 30 days’ prior written notice. The professional services rendered to us by Prof. Günzburg and Dr. Salmons are charged at a negotiated and confidential hourly rate.
 
The Vin-de-Bona Consulting Agreement requires that Prof. Günzburg and Dr. Salmons not disclose or use our confidential information for any purpose, other than performing services under the Consulting Agreement, without our prior written consent. Also, during the term of the Vin-de-Bona Consulting Agreement and for a period of twelve months after termination or expiration of the agreement, Dr. Günzburg and Dr. Salmons are prohibited from soliciting any of our customers, employees, suppliers or other persons with whom they had dealings during the tenure of their consultancy for us.
 
In September 2014, Dr. Günzburg was appointed as our Chief Scientific Officer. Dr. Günzburg is compensated for being our Chief Scientific Officer by us issuing Vin-de-Bona 500,000 restricted shares of our common stock. Dr. Günzburg is compensated in the same way and in the same amount for each succeeding year during which he serves as our Chief Scientific Officer.
 
Dr. Löhr, a noted European oncologist and gastroenterologist, also participates in the development of our Cancer Program. Dr. Löhr, currently with the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, served as Principal Investigator of the earlier Phase 1/2 and Phase 2 clinical trials (discussed below) of the combination of CapCell®  with low-dose ifosfamide in patients with advanced, inoperable pancreatic cancer. CapCell®  is now known as and hereinafter referred to as CypCaps™ denoting encapsulated cells using the Cell-in-a-Box® technology that will be used in our LAPC trial. Like Dr. Günzburg and Dr. Salmons, Dr. Löhr is involved in planning and overseeing much of our planned clinical trial in LAPC. Dr. Löhr is the Chairman of our Medical and Scientific Advisory Board and a consultant to us. Dr. Löhr received 500,000 shares of our restricted common stock to serve as the Chairman of our Medical and Scientific Advisory Board. Since April 15, 2014, Dr. Löhr also receives fees to provide professional consulting services to us through his consulting company based upon a confidential hourly rate.

History of the Business
 
We were incorporated in 1996. In 2013, we restructured our operations to focus on biotechnology, having been a nutraceutical products company before then. The restructuring occurred so we could develop a unique, effective and safe way to treat cancer and diabetes. On January 6, 2015, we changed our name from “Nuvilex, Inc.” to “PharmaCyte Biotech, Inc.” to reflect the nature of our business.
 
As mentioned above, we are now a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing and preparing to commercialize cellular therapies for cancer and diabetes using our live cell encapsulation technology. This resulted from entering into the following agreements.
 
On May 26, 2011, we entered an Asset Purchase Agreement with SG Austria (“SG Austria APA”) to purchase 100% of the assets and liabilities of SG Austria. Under the SG Austria APA, Austrianova and Bio Blue Bird AG ("Bio Blue Bird"), then wholly-owned subsidiaries of SG Austria, were to become wholly-owned subsidiaries of ours on the condition that we pay SG Austria $2.5 million and 100,000,000 shares of our common stock. We were to receive 100,000 shares of common stock of Austrianova and nine bearer shares of Bio Blue Bird representing 100% of the ownership of Bio Blue Bird.
 
Through two addenda to the SG Austria APA, the closing date of the SG Austria APA was extended twice by agreement between the parties.
 
In June 2013, we and SG Austria entered a Third Addendum to the SG Austria APA (“Third Addendum”). The Third Addendum materially changed the transaction contemplated by the SG Austria APA. Under the Third Addendum, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Bio Blue Bird and received a 14.5% equity interest in SG Austria. We paid: (i) $500,000 to retire all outstanding debt of Bio Blue Bird; and (ii) $1.0 million to SG Austria. We also paid SG Austria $1,572,193 in exchange for the 14.5% equity interest of SG Austria. The transaction required SG Austria to return to us the 100,000,000 shares of our common stock held by SG Austria and for us to return to SG Austria the 100,000 shares of common stock of Austrianova we held.
 
Effective as of the same date we entered the Third Addendum, we and SG Austria also entered a Clarification Agreement to the Third Addendum (“Clarification Agreement”) to clarify and include certain language that was inadvertently left out of the Third Addendum. Among other things, the Clarification Agreement confirmed that the Third Addendum granted us an exclusive, worldwide license to use, with a right to sublicense, the Cell-in-a-Box® technology and trademark for the development of therapies for cancer.
 
With respect to Bio Blue Bird, Bavarian Nordic A/S (“Bavarian Nordic”) and GSF-Forschungszentrum für Umwelt u. Gesundheit GmbH (collectively, “Bavarian Nordic/GSF”) and Bio Blue Bird entered into a non-exclusive License Agreement (“Bavarian Nordic/GSF License Agreement”) in July 2005, whereby Bio Blue Bird was granted a non-exclusive license to further develop, make, have made (including services under contract for Bio Blue Bird or a sub-licensee, by Contract Manufacturing Organizations, Contract Research Organizations, Consultants, Logistics Companies or others), obtain marketing approval, sell and offer for sale the clinical data generated from the pancreatic cancer clinical trials that used the cells and capsules developed by Bavarian Nordic/GSF (then known as “CapCells”) or otherwise use the licensed patent rights related thereto in the countries in which patents had been granted. Bio Blue Bird was required to pay Bavarian Nordic a royalty of 3% of the net sales value of each licensed product sold by Bio Blue Bird and/or its Affiliates and/or its sub-licensees to a buyer. The term of the Bavarian Nordic/GSF License Agreement continued on a country by country basis until the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights.
 
Bavarian Nordic/GSF and Bio Blue Bird amended the Bavarian Nordic License Agreement in December 2006 (“First Amendment to Bavarian Nordic/GSF License Agreement”) to reflect that: (i) the license granted was exclusive; (ii) a royalty rate increased from 3% to 4.5%; (iii) Bio Blue Bird assumed the patent prosecution expenses for the existing patents; and (iv) to make clear that the license will survive as a license granted by one of the licensors if the other licensor rejects performance under the Bavarian Nordic License Agreement due to any actions or declarations of insolvency.
 
In June 2013, we acquired from Austrianova an exclusive, worldwide license to use the Cell-in-a-Box® technology and trademark for the development of a therapy for Type 1 and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes (“Diabetes Licensing Agreement”). This allows us to develop a therapy to treat diabetes through encapsulation of a human cell line that has been genetically modified to produce, store and release insulin in response to the levels of blood sugar in the human body.

In October 2014, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with the UTS (“Melligen Cell License Agreement”) in Australia to use insulin-producing genetically engineered human liver cells developed by UTS to treat Type 1 diabetes and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes. These cells, named “Melligen”, were tested by UTS in mice and shown to produce insulin in direct proportion to the amount of glucose in their surroundings. In those studies, when Melligen cells were transplanted into immunosuppressed diabetic mice, the blood glucose levels of the mice became normal. In other words, the Melligen cells reportedly reversed the diabetic condition.
 
In December 2014, we acquired from Austrianova an exclusive, worldwide license to use the Cell-in-a-Box® technology and trademark in combination with genetically modified non-stem cell lines which are designed to activate cannabinoid prodrug molecules for development of therapies for diseases and their related symptoms using of the Cell-in-a-Box® technology and trademark (“Cannabis Licensing Agreement”). This allows us to develop a therapy to treat cancer and other diseases and symptoms through encapsulation of genetically modified cells designed to convert cannabinoids to their active form using the Cell-in-a-Box® technology and trademark.
 
In July 2016, we entered into a Binding Memorandum of Understanding with Austrianova (“Austrianova MOU”). Pursuant to the Austrianova MOU, Austrianova will actively work with us to seek an investment partner or partners who will finance clinical trials and further develop products for our therapy for cancer, in exchange for which we, Austrianova and any future investment partner will each receive a portion of the net revenue from the sale of cancer products.
 
In October 2016, Bavarian Nordic/GSF and Bio Blue Bird further amended the Bavarian Nordic License Agreement (“Second Amendment to Bavarian Nordic/GSF License Agreement”) in order to: (i) include the right to import in the scope of the license; (ii) reflect ownership and notification of improvements; (iii) clarify which provisions survive expiration or termination of the Bavarian Nordic License Agreement; (iv) provide rights to Bio Blue Bird to the clinical data after the expiration of the licensed patent rights; and (v) change the notice address and recipients of Bio Blue Bird.
 
In August 2017, we entered into a Binding Term Sheet (“Binding Term Sheet”) with SG Austria and Austrianova pursuant to which the parties reached an agreement to amend certain provisions in the SG Austria APA, the Diabetes Licensing Agreement, the Cannabis Licensing Agreement and the Vin-de-Bona Consulting Agreement.
 
In May 2018, the Company entered into the amendments contemplated by the Binding Term Sheet (“Binding Term Sheet Amendments”). The Binding Term Sheet Amendments provide that our obligation to make milestone payments to Austrianova is eliminated in their entirety under the: (i) Cannabis License Agreement; and (ii) the Diabetes License Agreement, as amended. The Binding Term Sheet Amendments also provide that our obligation to make milestone payments to SG Austria pursuant to the SG Austria APA, as amended and clarified, is eliminated in their entirety. One of the Binding Term Sheet Amendments also provides that the scope of the Diabetes License Agreement is expanded to include all cell types and cell lines of any kind or description now or later identified, including, but not limited to, primary cells, mortal cells, immortal cells and stem cells at all stages of differentiation and from any source specifically designed to produce insulin for the treatment of diabetes.
 
In addition, one of the Binding Term Sheet Amendments provides that we will have a 5-year right of first refusal from August 30, 2017 in the event that Austrianova chooses to sell, transfer or assign at any time during this period the Cell-in-a-Box® technology, tradename and Associated Technologies (defined below), intellectual property, trade secrets and know-how, which includes the right to purchase any manufacturing facility used for the Cell-in-a-Box® encapsulation process and a non-exclusive license to use the special cellulose sulfate utilized with the Cell-in-a-Box® encapsulation process (collectively, “Associated Technologies”); provided, however, that the Associated Technologies subject to the right of first refusal do not include Bac-in-a-Box®. Additionally, for a period of one year from August 30, 2017 one of the Binding Term Sheet Amendments provides that Austrianova will not solicit, negotiate or entertain any inquiry regarding the potential acquisition of the Cell-in-a-Box® and its Associated Technologies.
 
The Binding Term Sheet Amendments further provide that: (i) the royalty payments on gross sales as specified in the SG Austria APA, the Cannabis License Agreement and the Diabetes License Agreement are changed to 4%; and (ii) the royalty payments on amounts received by us from sublicensees on sublicensees’ gross sales under the same agreements are changed to 20% of the amount received us from our sublicensees, provided, however, that in the event the amounts received by us from sublicensees is 4% or less of sublicensees’ gross sales, Austrianova will receive 50% of what we receive (up to 2%) and then additionally 20% of any amount we receive over that 4%.

One of the Binding Term Sheet Amendments requires that we pay $900,000 to Austrianova ratably over a nine-month period in the amount of two $50,000 payments each month during the nine-month period on the days of the month to be agreed upon between the parties, with a cure period of 20 calendar days after receipt by us of written notice from Austrianova that we have failed to pay timely a monthly payment. As of April 30, 2019, the $900,000 amount has been paid in full.
 
The Binding Term Sheet Amendments also provide that Austrianova receives 50% of any other financial and non-financial consideration received from our sublicensees of the Cell-in-a-Box® technology.
 
Finally, one of the Binding Term Sheet Amendments provides that Dr. Günzburg will not receive any cash compensation from us for services rendered as our Chief Scientific Officer under the Vin-de-Bona Consulting Agreement for a period of six months beginning September 1, 2017.
 
Goal and Strategies to Implement
 
Our goal is to become an industry-leading biotechnology company using the Cell-in-a-Box® technology as a platform upon which therapies for cancer and diabetes are developed and obtain marketing approval for these therapies from regulatory agencies in the U.S., the European Union (“E.U.”), Australia and Canada.
 
Our strategies to implement our goal consist of the following:
 

• | Submission of our IND to the FDA and for the FDA to allow us to commence a clinical trial for LAPC;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials that demonstrate the effectiveness of our cancer therapy in reducing the production and accumulation of malignant ascites fluid in the abdomen that is characteristic of pancreas and other abdominal cancers;

Cell Therapy Product Development
 
In our efforts to bring potential treatments to bear on pancreatic and other solid tumor cancers, we acquired Bio Blue Bird. This subsidiary holds our exclusive license, as amended, to a certain type of genetically modified cell line we use with the Cell-in-a-Box® live cell encapsulation technology for use in oncology. We have also entered into license agreements (discussed above and below) to use Cell-in-a-Box® technology to develop a therapy for Type 1 and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes, as well as cancer therapies where the Cell-in-a-Box® technology is combined with certain cannabinoids.
 
Our focus is currently placed on the preparations for our planned Phase 2b clinical trial in LAPC. These preparations include the live cell encapsulation of cancer prodrug-activating cells – the cells that convert the prodrug ifosfamide into its cancer-killing form. For our trial, as in the earlier Phase 1/2 and Phase 2 clinical trials that were done using live cell encapsulation plus ifosfamide, live cells expressing a cytochrome P450 isozyme will be encapsulated using the Cell-in-a-Box® technology. These capsulated cells will be implanted as close to the patient’s tumor as possible. Once implanted, ifosfamide, a chemotherapy drug that is normally activated in the liver, will be given intravenously at approximately one-third (1 g/m2) of the normal dose. The ifosfamide will be carried by the circulatory system to where the encapsulated cells have been implanted. When the ifosfamide flows through the porous capsules with the live cells inside, they act as a “bio-artificial liver” and convert the inactive form of the chemotherapy prodrug ifosfamide to its active form at or near the cancerous tumor. The results of this “targeted chemotherapy” are discussed in more detail above and below.
 
The Cell-in-a-Box® encapsulation technology potentially enables genetically engineered live human cells to be used as miniature factories. The technology results in the formation of pin-head sized cellulose-based porous capsules in which genetically modified live human cells can be encapsulated and maintained. In the laboratory setting, which involves the large-scale amplification and production of useful biotech products outside the body of a person or animal, the proprietary live cell encapsulation technology has been shown to create a micro-environment in which these encapsulated cells survive and flourish. They are protected from environmental challenges, such as the sheer forces associated with bioreactors, passage through catheters and needles, etc., enabling greater growth and production of the end-product. The capsules are largely composed of cellulose (cotton) and are bio-inert.

Our encapsulation technology has the potential to enable live cells to survive in the human host and function like any other living cell in the body. The capsules contain small pores. The pores are big enough to allow nutrients in and waste products out of the capsules and small enough to keep the cells inside. Small molecules (such as ifosfamide, nutrients, oxygen and waste products) can pass through the pores of the capsules easily. The cells of the human’s immune system cannot. The live cells inside the capsules do not protrude through the pores of the capsules, for if they did so, they would be subject to immune system attack. The encapsulated cells live in the body and behave like a miniature organ of the body without any inflammatory response or rejection. Furthermore, the cellulose-based capsules do not appear to irritate or inflame nearby tissues. Nor do they cause fibrous overgrowth in the area where the capsules are implanted.
 
Market Opportunity and the Competitive Landscape
 
The two areas we are currently developing for live cell encapsulation-based therapies are cancer and diabetes.
 
The Cell-in-a-Box® capsules are comprised of cotton’s natural component - cellulose. Other materials used by competitors include alginate, collagen, chitosan, gelatin and agarose. Alginate appears to be the most widely used of these. We believe the inherent strength and durability of our cellulose-based capsules provides us with advantages over the competition. For example, the Cell-in-a-Box® capsules have remained intact for approximately two years in humans and for several months in animals during clinical trials and preclinical studies, respectively. They do so with no evidence of rupture, damage, degradation, fibrous overgrowth or immune system response. The cells within the capsules also remained alive and functioning during these studies. Other encapsulating materials degrade in the human body over time, leaving the encapsulated cells open to immune system attack. Damage to surrounding tissues has also been reported to occur over time when other types of encapsulation materials begin to degrade
 
Studies have also shown that cells encapsulated using the Cell-in-a-Box® technology can be frozen for extended periods of time. When thawed, the cells are recovered with approximately 90% viability. We are unaware of any other cell encapsulation material that is capable of protecting their encapsulated cells to this degree. The implications of this property of the Cell-in-a-Box® technology are obvious - long-term storage of encapsulated cells and shipment of encapsulated cells over long distances.
 
We believe our live cell encapsulation technology may have significant new advantages and opportunities for us in numerous and developing ways. For example: 
 
• | Cancerous diseases may be treated by placing encapsulated drug-converting cells that convert a chemotherapy prodrug near the cancerous tumor;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Confinement and maintenance of therapeutic cells that activate a chemotherapy prodrug may be placed at the site of implantation in a blood vessel near the cancerous tumor results in “targeted chemotherapy;”
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased efficacy of a chemotherapy prodrug may allow for lower doses of the drug to be given to a patient, significantly reducing or even eliminating side effects from the chemotherapy;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Encapsulating genetically modified live cells has the potential for the treatment of systemic diseases of various types, including diabetes;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Multi-layered patent and trade secret protection and marketing exclusivity for our technology exists and is being expanded;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cell-in-a-Box® capsules can prevent immune system attack of functional cells inside them without the need for immunosuppressive drug therapy; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety and effectiveness of the Cell-in-a-Box® technology and the cells used with our technology have already been shown in both human clinical trials and animal studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The field of diabetes cell therapy development is competitive. There are numerous companies developing cell-based therapies for diabetes. These competitors include companies such as Viacyte, Inc. (“Viacyte”) in collaboration with Gore, Semma Therapeutics, Inc. in collaboration with Defymed, SAS, Diabetes Research Institute Foundation, Beta-O2 Technologies Ltd., Diatranz Otsuka Ltd., Sernova Corp. and BetaCell NV. All these entities are developing some form of encapsulation-based disease therapies. Although such competition exists, we believe these other companies are developing encapsulation-based therapies using encapsulation materials and methodologies that produce capsules or devices that are far less robust than ours or that are associated with other problems, such as extremely short shelf-life of the product and/or fibrotic overgrowth of their encapsulation products when implanted in the body. These properties are not characteristic of the Cell-in-a-Box® capsules.

Pancreatic cancer is increasing in most industrialized countries. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2019 there will be 56,770 people in the U.S. diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. It estimates 45,750 patients with pancreatic cancer will die in 2019.
 
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (“IARC”) released new global cancer statistics in September 2018. Of the 18 million cancer diagnoses predicted worldwide in 2018, nearly half 500,000 will be pancreatic cancer. The World Pancreatic Cancer Coalition (“WPCC”) predicts that more than 430,000 pancreatic cancer deaths worldwide will occur in 2018. A diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is associated with poor prognosis due to early micrometastatic spread. The five-year survival rate for metastatic pancreatic cancer is approximately 7% according to the American Cancer Society.
 
Even with the best available therapy, patients with advanced pancreatic cancer can only expect median survival times of about 8.5 months. The percentage of one-year survivors is in the order of approximately 20%. The disease is operable in about only 10% of patients after being diagnosed. This is largely because pancreatic cancer shows no symptoms until it is at an advanced stage (stage 3 or 4) of development. However, over the past few years, radiologic techniques have advanced to the point where some pancreatic cancers may be detectable somewhat sooner. A new definition of “borderline operable” has been coined, and a greater number of pancreatic cancers are now being detected when they are “locally advanced” rather than after they have metastasized and spread to other organs in the body.
 
Our goal is to satisfy a clear unmet medical need for patients with LAPC whose tumors no longer respond after 4-6 months of treatment with the chemotherapy combination of Abraxane® plus gemcitabine or FOLFIRINOX. For these patients, there is currently no effective therapy. We believe there will be no therapy comparable to our Cell-in-a-Box® plus low dose of ifosfamide combination therapy when it is used in these patients.
 
We face intense competition in the field of treating pancreatic cancer. In addition to commercial entities such as Halozyme, Inc., OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Boston Biomedical, Inc., to name a few of the smaller companies, several academic institutions and cancer centers are trying to improve the outcome for pancreatic cancer patients. There are several drugs already available and in the pipelines of pharmaceutical companies worldwide, not the least of which is the combination of the drugs of Abraxane® and gemcitabine. This is the primary FDA-approved combination of drugs for treating advanced pancreatic cancer. In Europe, and more recently in the U.S., the 4-drug combination known as FOLFIRINOX has also found use as a first-line treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer. Some of our competitive strengths include the Orphan Drug Designation we have been granted by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for our pancreatic cancer therapy, our trade secrets, the patents we are seeking and the licensing agreements we have that are described in this Report. Yet many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and marketing resources than we do. They also have stronger name recognition, better brand loyalty and long-standing relationships with customers and suppliers. Our future success will be dependent upon our ability to compete.
 
We believe our therapy for pancreatic cancer has already shown promise through the completion of a Phase 1/2 and a Phase 2 clinical trial in advanced, inoperable pancreatic cancer. Our therapy for diabetes has also shown promise. Completed research studies have resulted in positive responses in animal models using the Melligen cells. We believe we are in a strong competitive position considering our unique encapsulation technology and the genetically modified cells that we have the exclusive worldwide license to use in most industrialized countries.
 
As discussed above in the section on cannabinoids, PharmaCyte has several major competitors developing Cannabis-based therapies for cancer.
 
Previous Clinical Trials Using Our Encapsulation Technology
 
Two previous clinical trials using what is now our encapsulation technology were carried out in Europe in 1998-1999 and 2000, respectively. Both employed the combination of the cellulose-based live cell encapsulation technology with low doses of the anticancer drug ifosfamide. The results of the two clinical trials have appeared in the peer-reviewed scientific literature and are summarized as follows:
Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial
 
Dates of Trial and Location: This clinical trial was opened on July 28, 1998 and closed on September 20, 1999. It was carried out at the Division of Gastroenterology, University of Rostock, Germany.
 
Identity of Trial Sponsors: The clinical trial was sponsored by Bavarian Nordic.

Trial Design: The clinical trial was an open-label, prospective, single-arm and single center trial.
 
Patient Information: A total of 17 patients were enrolled in the clinical trial (51 were screened). A total of 14 patients were treated because two of the original 17 patients developed severe infections before the start of the clinical trial and had to be treated by other means. For the other patient, angiography was not successful, causing the patient to be disqualified from participating in the clinical trial.
Trial Criteria: Criteria for enrolling in the clinical trial included inoperable pancreatic adenocarcinoma Stage 3-4 (according to IUCC criteria) as determined by histology and measured by computerized tomography (“CT”) scan and the patients must not have had any prior chemotherapy for their disease.
Duration of Treatment and Dosage Information: On day 0, celiac angiography was performed and 300 (in 13 patients, 250 in one) of the capsules containing the ifosfamide-activating cells were placed by supraselective catheterization of an artery leading to the tumor. Each capsule (~0.7 mm in diameter) contained about 20,000 cells. The cells overexpressed CYP2B1 (a cytochrome P450 isoform), which catalyzed the conversion of the anticancer prodrug ifosfamide into its “cancer-killing” form.
 
On day 1, patients were monitored for evidence of any clinically relevant adverse reactions, e.g. allergy and/or pancreatitis. On days 2-4, each patient received low-dose (1 g/m2 body surface area) ifosfamide in 250 ml of normal saline administered systemically as a 1-hour infusion. This was accompanied by a 60% dose equivalent of the uroprotective drug Mesna, which is used to reduce the side effects of ifosfamide chemotherapy, given as three intravenous injections. This regimen was repeated on days 23-25 for all but two patients who received only one round of ifosfamide. A total of only two cycles of ifosfamide were given to the remainder of the patients.
 
Specific Clinical Endpoints: Median survival time from the time of diagnosis, the percentage of patients who survived one year or more and the quality of life of each patient were examined in the clinical trial.
Observational Metrics Utilized and Actual Results Observed: Standard National Cancer Institute (“NCI”) criteria for evaluating tumor growth were used to assess results:
 

• | stable disease (tumors 50-125% of initial size) (“SD”);
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | partial remission (more than 50% reduction in tumor volume) (“PR”); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | minor response (tumor reduction of between 25% and 50%) (“MR”).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
Effects of the treatment on tumor size were measured by CT scans. Control CT scans were scheduled for weeks 10 and 20, respectively. During the final visit a control angiography was performed. On the initial CT scan, the scan demonstrating the largest diameter of the primary tumor was identified and the area measured. Using appropriate landmarks, an identical scan was used for comparison. CT scans were evaluated by two unrelated radiologists, one of whom was not involved in the clinical trial. After formally finishing the clinical trial, patients were followed on an ambulatory basis with visits once every three months.
 
Toxicity was measured based on WHO/NCI guidelines on common toxicity criteria. The WHO and the NCI use standardized classifications of the adverse events associated with the use of cancer drugs. In cancer clinical trials, these are used to determine if a drug or treatment causes unwanted side effects (“Adverse Events”) when used under specific conditions. For example, the most commonly used classification is known as the “Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events” developed by the NCI in the U.S. Most clinical trials carried out in the U.S. and the United Kingdom code their Adverse Event. This system consists of five grades. These are: 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe; 4 = life-threatening; 5 = death. In the studies reported for Cell-in-a-Box® plus low-dose ifosfamide combination in pancreatic cancer patients, the study investigators noted 11 Serious Adverse Events (“SAEs”) in 7 patients, none of which were believed to be treatment-related.
 
Each patient’s need for pain medication and the quality of life (“QOL”) was monitored using a questionnaire established for diseases of the pancreas. A QOL questionnaire for cancer patients, QLQ-C30, had been validated in several languages, but the module for pancreatic cancer per se was still under development at the time of the study with respect to reliability, sensibility against changes and multicultural validation. Accordingly, a version of the core questionnaire and a German QOL scale (published in 1995) for pancreatic cancer patients was used. QOL data were documented independently from safety and efficacy data by having patients complete an independent questionnaire. Assessment of QOL data did not interfere with routine documentation of Adverse Events reported by the patients. QOL questionnaires were analyzed according to the criteria developed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (“EORTC”). As used in the description of the QOL results discussed in the published report of the Phase 1/2 trial of the Cell-in-a-Box® plus low-dose ifosfamide combination in pancreatic cancer patients, the questionnaire was used to assess the QOL of patients undergoing treatment. The QOL was analyzed in a similar manner to the way that a QOL questionnaire developed by the EORTC is usually analyzed. This latter questionnaire is known as EORTC QLQ-C30. QOL data were available from the baseline evaluation for 14 patients and for analysis of change for 8 patients.

A clinical benefit score based on variables, including the “Karnofsky Score” and body weight, was determined. Pain and analgesic consumption were calculated from the QOL questionnaires. The Karnofsky Score is a scale that is used to attempt to quantify a cancer patient’s general well-being and activities of daily life. It is often used to judge the suitability of patients for inclusion into clinical trials. As a clinical trial progresses, a patient’s Karnofsky Score can change. It is also used to assess a patient’s QOL as a clinical trial progresses. The scale starts at 100 (normal, no complaints, no evidence of disease) and decreases in decrements of 10 down through 50 (requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care) all the way to 10 (moribund, fatal processes progressing rapidly) and finally to 0 (deceased). Pain intensity was measured on a visual analog scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (the most intensive pain imaginable) in increments of 10. Analgesic consumption was assessed using a separate scale in which 0 indicated no regular consumption of analgesics and 25, 50 and 100 indicated administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opiates several times per year, per month or per week, respectively.
 
The primary tumor did not grow in any of the 14 patients. Two patients had a PR; 12 patients exhibited SD; and two patients showed an MR.
 
Median survival time of patients in this clinical trial was 39 weeks. The one-year survival rate was 36%.
 
Within the 20-week study period, three patients died from disease progression (on days 9, 85 and 132). Upon postmortem examination, the patient who died on day 9 from recurrent pulmonary embolism was found to have extensive tumor necrosis.
 
The chemotherapy regimen was well tolerated. No toxicity beyond Grade 2 (moderate adverse effect) was detected in any of the 14 patients.
 
Eleven SAEs were seen in 7 patients during the study period. None of them were treatment-related (due to capsule implantation or ifosfamide administration). These SAEs were attributed to underlying disease and/or the effects associated with the disease.
 
Implanting the capsules did not result in any obvious allergic or inflammatory response, and no patients developed pancreatitis during the trial. Some patients exhibited elevated amylase levels, presumably due to tumor infiltration of the pancreas and limited obstructive chronic pancreatitis. However, no further increase in amylase levels was seen after angiography and capsule implantation.
 
In accordance with the report of the study, only one Adverse Event (increased lipase activity on day 15 after installation of the capsules), which was a Grade 1 Adverse Event, “may” have been linked to implanting the capsules.
 
Ten of 14 patients experienced a “clinical benefit” which means either no increase or a decrease in pain intensity. For 7 of the patients, this was confirmed by their analgesic consumption. None of these “benefited” patients registered an increased analgesic usage either in terms of dosage or WHO levels.
 
None of the patients showed an increased Karnofsky Score after treatment. However, 7 of the 14 patients had stable Karnofsky Scores at the week 10 assessment. For 4 of these patients, their indices were still stable at the week 20 assessment.
 
One patient’s body weight increased at both weeks 10 and 20 and another patient showed increased weight at week 10 (this patient withdrew from the clinical trial and no week 20 weight was obtained). Two patients showed stable body weights at week 10, one of whom dropped out of the clinical trial and the other showed weight loss at week 20.
 
Two scenarios were used to establish the overall integrative clinical benefit response, where each patient was given a +2 score for an improved value, a +1 score for a stable value and a -1 score for a worsened value for each of four criteria (pain, analgesic consumption, Karnofsky Score and body weight) as compared to the relevant week 0 values.
 
The “worst case scenario” required a pain relief score of 20 points or more to be judged an improvement and a decrease in the Karnofsky Score of 10 points or more to indicate worsening. Using this scenario, 50% or 7 of the treated patients experienced clinical benefit; 21.4% or 3 patients were neutral (benefits were offset by impairments); and 28.6% or 4 patients had no clinical benefit. The latter included those passing away before the median survival time.
 
In the “best case scenario,” a pain relief score of 10 points or more was an improvement. A decrease in Karnofsky Score of 20 points or more was considered a worsening. In this scenario, 71.4% or 10 patients had clinical benefit, 14.2% of patients showed neither benefit nor deterioration and 14.3% patients had no benefit.

Standard of Care: At the time this clinical trial was conducted, only one FDA-approved treatment for advanced, inoperable pancreatic cancer was available. That was the drug gemcitabine, first approved by the FDA in 1996.
 
An examination of the prescribing information for gemcitabine reflects that the median survival seen in the Phase 3 pancreatic cancer clinical trial for gemcitabine was approximately 23 weeks (5.7 months). The percentage of one-year survivors was approximately 18%. In a Phase 3 clinical trial of Celgene’s Abraxane® plus gemcitabine combination that was approved by the FDA in September 2013, the median survival time for patients was about 8.5 months and the percentage of one-year survivors was approximately 35%.
 
The treatment with gemcitabine of patients with pancreatic cancer is often associated with severe side effects. According to the prescribing information for gemcitabine, for use to treat pancreatic cancer the recommended dose is 1000 mg/m2 given intravenously over 30 minutes. The schedule of administration is: weeks 1-8, weekly dosing for 7 weeks followed by one-week rest and then after week 8, weekly dosing on days 1, 8 and 15 of 28-day cycles.
 
Reductions in the doses of gemcitabine are necessitated by the occurrence of myelosuppression. Permanent discontinuation of gemcitabine is necessary for any of the following:
 

• | unexplained dyspnea or other evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | severe hepatotoxicity;
--+-----------------------


• | hemolytic-uremic syndrome;
--+---------------------------


• | capillary leak syndrome; and
--+-----------------------------


• | posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.
--+----------------------------------------------

 
Gemcitabine should be withheld, or its dose reduced by 50% for other severe (Grade 3 or 4) non-hematologic toxicity until that toxicity is resolved.
 
Conclusions: In the opinion of the trial’s investigators, in this Phase 1/2 clinical trial the use of the combination of Cell-in-a-Box® capsules plus low-dose ifosfamide was both safe and effective. This assessment was not based on the opinion of any drug regulatory authority and does not guarantee that that this assessment will be maintained in any late-phase clinical trial or that any drug regulatory authority will ultimately determine that the Cell-in-a-Box® plus low-dose ifosfamide combination is safe and effective for the purposes of granting marketing approval.
 
In the Phase 1/2 clinical trial only a small number of patients were evaluated. Statistical parameters were not used in the published reports of the Phase 1/2 trial to validate the anticancer efficacy of the Cell-in-a-Box® plus low-dose ifosfamide combination in patients with advanced, inoperable pancreatic cancer. In the opinion of the investigators, the results indicate a trend towards efficacy; accordingly, the results should not be viewed as absolute numbers. It should be noted, however, that because the results were not statistically significant, any observations of efficacy must be weighed against the possibility that the results were due to chance alone. The purpose of the clinical trial was not to obtain data so that marketing approval could be obtained from regulatory authorities. Rather, the clinical trial allowed the investigators to determine whether the Cell-in-a- Box® capsules plus low-dose ifosfamide combination holds promise as a therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer. In the cancer arena, Phase 1/2 clinical trials are used to: (i) establish the safety of the drug or treatment being investigated; and (ii) determine if a trend towards efficacy exists. In accordance with FDA guidance, as well as similar guidance from other regulatory authorities in countries other than the U.S., we realize that a large, multicenter, randomized, comparative study needs to be conducted and the results from such a trial would have to confirm the results from this previous Phase 1/2 trial before an application for marketing approval could be filed with the FDA or EMA. We are currently engaged in preparing an IND for submission to the FDA to conduct a new clinical trial.
 
If our cancer therapy is approved by the regulatory agencies, we believe it could provide a significant benefit to those with this devastating and deadly disease, not only in terms of life-span but also in terms of increased quality of life. Also, we believe that success of the live cell encapsulation technology in the pancreatic cancer setting may lead to its successful use in developing therapies for other forms of solid cancerous tumors after preclinical studies and clinical trials have been completed.

Phase 2 Clinical Trial
 
Location of Trial: The clinical trial was opened on November 16, 1999 and closed on December 1, 2000. This clinical trial was carried out at four centers in two countries in Europe. These were in Berne, Switzerland, and in Rostock, Munich and Berlin, Germany.
Trial Sponsor: The clinical trial was sponsored by Bavarian Nordic.
 
Trial Design: This was an open-label, prospective, single-arm multi-site study.
 
Patient Information: All 13 patients enrolled in the trial were treated. Twelve patients exhibited Stage 4 disease. The remaining patient had Stage 3 disease. Ten of the 13 patients exhibited metastases.
 
Duration of Treatment and Dosage Information: The number of capsules implanted varied from 221 to 300 with a mean of 244. On day 1, patients were monitored for any allergic reactions to capsule implantation and/or pancreatitis. The administration schedule of the treatment was the same as in the earlier Phase 1/2 trial, except that in this Phase 2 trial the dose of ifosfamide was doubled to 2 g/m2. In the Phase1/2 trial, it was 1g/m2. On days 2-4, patients received 2 g/m2 in normal saline as a one-hour infusion. The urinary tract protector Mesna was also given as 3 intravenous injections. This regimen was repeated on days 23-25.
 
Specific Clinical Endpoints: The primary endpoint of the trial was to determine response rate as defined by SD, PR and MR as well as the clinical benefit (Karnofsky score) of the treatment. The timing of the tumor size measurements and determination of tumor sizes by CT scans were done by independent radiologists. A secondary endpoint was to determine time to progression, tumor response, duration of partial or complete remission, length of symptom-free survival, survival time and quality of life. Another secondary endpoint was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the treatment regimen, with attention being paid to the appearance of pancreatitis or immediate allergic reactions.
 
Safety Analysis of Angiography, Capsule Implantation and Chemotherapy: On average, angiography took approximately 40 minutes. For 5 of the patients in this clinical trial, more than one blood vessel had to be used for placement of the capsules. The administration of the capsules was well tolerated. There were no signs of allergic reactions or hemorrhagic cystitis after implantation of the capsules. Two patients had increased levels of serum lipase at baseline. After additional measurements, these were not considered to be clinically relevant. The dose of ifosfamide (2 g/m2) used was found to be toxic in most patients. This resulted in one patient having to reduce the ifosfamide dose in the second of the two cycles of treatment with the drug. The most common toxic effects were nausea, vomiting, malaise, anorexia and mild hematuria.
 
Serious Adverse Events: A total of 16 SAEs were documented in eight patients, including 3 SAEs leading to death. None of these SAEs were attributed to placement of the encapsulated cells. One patient experienced neurological impairment (drowsiness, nocturnal enuresis, mild somnolence) which was attributed to treatment with the 2 g/m2 dose of ifosfamide. All patients experienced between 5 and 19 SAEs. Six SAEs were rated as life-threatening; 10.2% were rated as severe; 28.7% were rated as moderate; and 53.7% were rated as mild. None of the SAEs was thought to be related to placement of the encapsulated cells, but 44% were related to the administration of ifosfamide at the elevated dose given. Most frequent SAEs were alopecia, anemia, leucopenia, nausea and vomiting or encephalopathy. Other SAEs were new or worse symptoms of the patients’ underlying disease. A total of 65 events met the NCI’s common toxicity criteria. Of these, 46.2% had Grade 1, 40% had Grade 2, 9.2% had Grade 3 and 4.6% had Grade 4 toxicities.
 
Tumor Reductions and Patient Survival Results: The size of the primary tumor was measured before starting the live cell encapsulation plus ifosfamide therapy and at weeks 10 and 20 post-treatment. No PRs were observed, but 4 patients exhibited tumor size reductions, 4 patients showed tumor growth and the remaining 5 patients had SD over the “follow-up” period after chemotherapy.
 
The median survival of patients was 40 weeks. Most the survival benefit was shown early during the entire observation period. However, as time progressed, these patients succumbed at the same rate as historical controls. This observation suggested to the investigators that prolongation of the survival benefit might be achieved if additional courses of ifosfamide chemotherapy were given. The one-year survival rate was 23%. It was thought that this may be attributable to the higher dose of ifosfamide used in this clinical trial.

Quality of Life: An assessment of the quality of life of the patients was performed in this clinical trial. Quality of life data were available for all the patients. According to this quality of life assessment, although pain during the night decreased, patients felt themselves to be less attractive and lost interest in sex. No additional improvements in patients’ quality of life were observed.
 
Conclusions: The opinions of the investigators were as follows: (i) the lack of “problems” associated with the implanted encapsulated cells was noted as in the Phase 1/2 trial; (ii) administering more than two courses of treatment with ifosfamide might have beneficial effects on survival; and (iii) since doubling the dose of ifosfamide from that used in the Phase 1/2 trial had no beneficial antitumor or survival effect but was associated with increased side effects from the treatment, the dose of ifosfamide to be used in combination with the encapsulated cells for all future trials should be 1 g/m2.
 
Manufacturing
 
We are outsourcing all cell growth, processing and encapsulation services needed for our future clinical trials of the encapsulated cell-based cancer and diabetes therapies. The Cell-in-a-Box® encapsulation will be done by Austrianova at its cGMP-compliant manufacturing facility in Bangkok, Thailand.
 
We initially engaged ViruSure GmbH (“ViruSure”), a professional cell growing and adventitious agent testing company that has had extensive experience with the CYP2B1-expressing cancer prodrug-activating cells that will be needed for our pancreatic cancer therapy. We did so to recover them from frozen stocks of similar cells developed by Bavarian Nordic and regenerate new stocks for use by us in our preclinical studies and clinical trials. ViruSure cloned new cells from one selected clone. We planned to use the clones to populate a Master Cell Bank (“MCB”) and a Working Cell Bank (“WCB”) for our future clinical trials.
 
In March 2014, we entered a Manufacturing Framework Agreement with Austrianova (“Manufacturing Framework Agreement”) pursuant to which Austrianova will encapsulate the genetically engineered live cells that will be used for our cancer therapy. We have also contracted with Austrianova to provide encapsulated insulin-producing cells for our preclinical studies in diabetes. At the appropriate time, we intend to enter into a similar manufacturing framework agreement with Austrianova for the encapsulated cells we will need for our diabetes therapy.
 
In April 2014, we entered an agreement with ViruSure pursuant to which ViruSure agreed to clone cells from the 22P1G cell line (the cells that express the CYP2B1 isoform of cytochrome P450 that converts ifosfamide into its cancer-killing form). In August 2014, we entered into a revised proposal with ViruSure pursuant to which ViruSure modified certain testing recommendations and cell banking procedures. ViruSure was engaged in the process of cloning cells for some time and conducted various tests of the cells it had grown for us.
 
In June 2017, we entered into an agreement with Eurofins for the preparation and characterization of a cGMP quality MCB for use in our therapy for pancreatic cancer. The agreement includes pre-bank testing, MCB preparation, MCB characterization, Working Cell Bank (“WCB”) preparation, WCB characterization, end of production characterization and related analyses, as well as optional testing. The MCB was initially planned to be used as a “safe” repository of the cloned cells that we would use in our cancer therapy. The WCB was planned to be used to supply the large numbers of cells needed for our preclinical studies, clinical trials and other purposes related to the development of our therapy for LAPC and other forms of solid tumor cancers.
 
In January 2018, we modified our agreement with Eurofins to exclude the WCB preparation and characterization, as well as the end of production characterization and related analysis. We did so to expedite the availability of the cells needed for encapsulation by Austrianova to conduct our planned clinical trial in LAPC and to save the costs.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Austrianova MOU, Austrianova and we have agreed to negotiate a new Manufacturing Framework Agreement pursuant to which Austrianova will provide us with Phase 3 clinical material utilizing the genetically engineered cells designed to activate ifosfamide that have been encapsulated using the Cell-in-a-Box® technology to conduct a late phase clinical trial in the U.S. with possible study sites in Europe.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
As a development stage biotechnology company that operates in the U.S., we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the research, testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our product candidates. Although the discussion below focuses on regulation in the U.S., we anticipate seeking approval for, and marketing of, our product candidates in other countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will also be the subject of extensive regulation, although there can be important differences with the U.S. The process of obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations will require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and may not be successful.

Regulatory approval, when obtained, may be limited in scope which may significantly limit the uses for which a product may be placed into the market. Further, approved drugs or biologic products, as well as their manufacturers, are subject to ongoing post-marketing review, inspection and discovery of previously unknown problems with such products or the manufacturing or quality control procedures used in their production. These may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use or in their withdrawal from the market. Any failure or delay by us, our suppliers of manufactured drug product, collaborators or licensees in obtaining regulatory approvals could adversely affect the marketing of our product candidates and our ability to receive product revenue, license revenue or profit-sharing payments. For more information, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
 
U.S. Government Regulation
 
The FDA is the main regulatory body that controls pharmaceuticals and biologics in the U.S. Its regulatory authority is based in the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”). Pharmaceutical products and biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes. A failure to comply explicitly with any requirements during the product development, approval, or post-approval periods, may lead to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the imposition by the FDA or by an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) of a hold on clinical trials, refusal to approve pending marketing applications or supplements, withdrawal of approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
 
The steps required before a new drug or biologic may be marketed in the U.S. generally include:
 

• | completion of preclinical studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”) protocols and regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the investigational product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and proof that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND to support human clinical testing in the U.S.;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an IRB at each clinical site before a trial may be initiated at that site;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with federal regulations and with Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”) standards to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product candidate for each target indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for a drug or Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for a biologic such as the therapies we are developing;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
 
Clinical Development
 
Before a drug or biologic product may be given to humans, it must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of a product candidate’s chemical and biological activities and animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy in humans. The results of these studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND which must be reviewed by the FDA for safety and other considerations before even an initial (Phase 1) clinical trial in humans can begin.
 
An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product candidate to humans. This authorization is required before interstate shipping and administration can commence of any new drug or biologic product destined for use in humans in the U.S.  A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required before commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period after submission of the IND, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. A clinical trial involves the administration of the investigational product candidate to patients under the supervision of qualified investigators following GCP standards. These international standards are meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors. A clinical trial is conducted under protocols that detail the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.

We devote significant resources to research and development programs to discover and develop potential future product candidates. The product candidates in our pipeline are at various stages of preclinical and clinical development. The path to regulatory approval includes three phases of clinical trials in which we collect data to support an application to regulatory agencies to allow us to ultimately market a product for treatment of a specified disease. There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in research and development of new products, and these can conceivably result in a high rate of failure. To bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval, and ultimately to market, takes years and the costs to do so are significant. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after the product is approved, based on post-marketing factors. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, reimbursement challenges, difficulty or excessive costs of manufacture, alternative therapies or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Uncertainties in the approval process of the regulatory agencies can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunities. Consequently, it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be submitted for approval, which have the highest likelihood of obtaining approval and which will be commercially viable and generate profits. Successful results in preclinical or clinical studies may not be an accurate predictor of the ultimate safety or effectiveness of a product candidate.
 
Phase 1 Clinical Trial: A Phase 1 clinical trial begins when a regulatory agency, such as the FDA, allows initiation of the clinical investigation of a new product candidate. The clinical trial studies a product candidate’s safety profile and may include a preliminary determination of a product candidate’s safe dosage range. The Phase 1 clinical trial can also determine how a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and excreted by the body and, therefore, the potential duration of its action.
Phase 2 Clinical Trial: A Phase 2 clinical trial is conducted on a limited number of patients; these patients can have a specific targeted disease. An initial evaluation of the product candidate’s effectiveness on patients is performed. Additional information on the product candidate’s safety and dosage range is obtained. For many diseases, a Phase 2 clinical trial can include up to several hundred patients.
Phase 3 Clinical Trial: A Phase 3 clinical trial is typically rigorously controlled, conducted in multiple centers and involves a larger target patient population that can consist of from several hundred to thousands of patients (depending on the disease being studied) to ensure that study results are statistically significant. During a Phase 3 clinical trial, physicians monitor patients to determine efficacy and to gather further information on safety. A Phase 3 clinical trial is designed to generate all the clinical data necessary to apply for marketing approval to a regulatory agency.
 
The decision to terminate development of an investigational product candidate may be made by either a health authority body, such as the FDA, by IRB/ethics committees, or by a company for various reasons. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the patients enrolled in the trial. In some cases, a clinical trial is overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, or the clinical monitoring board. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints. These decisions are based on the limited access to data from the ongoing trial. The suspension or termination of development can occur during any phase of a clinical trial if it is determined that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. There are also requirements for the registration of an ongoing clinical trial of a product candidate on public registries and the disclosure of certain information pertaining to the trial, as well as clinical trial results after completion.
 
A sponsor may be able to request a special protocol assessment (“SPA”), the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. A sponsor meeting the regulatory criteria may make a specific request for a SPA and provide information regarding the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. A SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins. All open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the record. The agreement will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins, except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the product candidate was identified after the testing began. A SPA is not binding if new circumstances arise, and there is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the study is subject to a SPA. Having a SPA does not guarantee that a product candidate will receive FDA approval.
 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational product candidate information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA to request regulatory approval for the product in the specified indications.

New Drug Applications and Biologic Licensing Applications
 
To obtain approval to market a drug or biologic in the U.S., a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the proposed indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing and controls, as well as the proposed labeling for the product, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a product, or from several alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 
In most cases, the NDA, in the case of a drug, or BLA, in the case of a biologic, must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. There may be some instances in which the user fee is waived. The FDA will initially review the NDA or BLA for completeness before it accepts the application for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. After the NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs and BLAs. During a normal review cycle, a product is given an FDA action or Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) date within 12 months of the submission, if the submission is accepted. The FDA can extend this review by three months to consider certain late-submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also issue a complete response, which may delay approval for several months or even years. The FDA reviews the NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP standards. The FDA may refer applications for novel product candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee. This is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
Before approving a NDA or a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities follow cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Also, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGMP standards. Manufacturers of human cellular or tissue-based biologics also must comply with the FDA’s Good Tissue Practices (“GTPs”), as applicable, and with the general biological product standards. After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the sponsor company’s manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (“REMS”) to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA/BLA or a NDA/BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA or BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data like that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA or BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs or BLAs.
 
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 
A sponsor of a clinical trial of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs and biologics, is required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public website. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigator involved, and other aspects of the clinical trial are made public as part of the registration. A sponsor is also obligated to disclose the results of a clinical trial after completion. Disclosure of the results can be delayed until the product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly-available information to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs.

Advertising and Promotion
 
The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs or biologics for “off-label” uses (uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the drug’s labeling) because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. Broadly speaking, a manufacturer may not promote a product for off-label use, but may engage in non-promotional, balanced communication regarding off-label use under specified conditions. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the Office of the Inspector General of Health & Human Services (“HHS”) and state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and/or agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products.
Post Approval Regulations
 
After regulatory approval of a drug or biologic is obtained, a company is required to comply with certain post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including a Phase 4 clinical trial and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization has begun. Also, as a holder of an approved NDA or BLA, a company is required to: (i) report adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA; (ii) provide updated safety and efficacy information; and (iii) comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of its products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP standards after approval to assure and preserve the long-term stability of the drug or biological product. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP standards, which imposes extensive procedural and substantive record keeping requirements. Also, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. In addition, FDA regulations require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP standards and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon a company and any third-party manufacturers that a company may decide to use. Manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP standards and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
U.S. Patent Extension and Marketing Exclusivity
 
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (“BPCIA”) amended the PHSA to authorize the FDA to approve similar versions of innovative biologics, commonly known as biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to establish its product as highly like an approved innovator biologic, among other requirements. The BPCIA bars the FDA from approving biosimilar applications for 12 years after an innovator biological product receives initial marketing approval.
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents, if granted, may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (“Hatch-Waxman Act”). The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent extension term of up to five years, as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug, biologic or medical device is under regulatory review. It is calculated as half of the testing phase (the time between the IND submission becoming effective and the NDA, BLA or premarket approval (“PMA”) submission) and all the review phase (the time between NDA, BLA or PMA submission and approval) up to a maximum extension of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug, biologic or medical device. In the future, if any of our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extension on patents covering those products that may be eligible for such patent term restoration.

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring such companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
European and Other International Government Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Some countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process to that of the FDA in that such countries require the submission of a clinical trial application (“CTA”) much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and an IRB. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, a clinical trial may proceed in that particular country.
 
To obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a new drug or biologic under the E.U. regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application (“MAA”) with the EMA, the E.U.’s counterpart to the U.S. FDA. It is like the NDA or the BLA, except for, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
 
Outside of the E.U. the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Internationally, clinical trials are generally required to be conducted in accordance with cGMP standards - applicable regulatory requirements of each jurisdiction and the medical ethics principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 
Regulatory Review
 
If a product candidate successfully completes a Phase 3 clinical trial and is submitted to regulatory agencies, such as the FDA in the U.S. and the EMA in Europe, the time to final marketing approval can vary from months to years, depending on several variables. These variables can include such things as the disease type, the strength and complexity of the data presented, the novelty of the target or compound, risk-management approval and whether multiple rounds of review are required for the agency to evaluate the submission. There is no guarantee that a potential treatment will receive marketing approval or that decisions on marketing approvals or treatment indications will be consistent across geographic areas. In some cases, further studies beyond the three-phase clinical trial process described above are required as a condition for approval of a NDA, a MAA or a BLA. Each country-specific regulatory agency requires monitoring of all aspects of a clinical trial and reporting all adverse events in the trial. A regulatory agency may also require the conduct of pediatric studies for the product and indication either before or after submission of a NDA or a BLA.
Approval by Regulatory Agencies
 
The results of the preclinical testing, production parameters and a clinical trial are submitted to the regulatory agency as part of a NDA, a MAA or a BLA for evaluation to determine if there is substantial evidence that the product is sufficiently safe and effective to warrant approval. In responding to a NDA, a MAA or a BLA, the regulatory agency may grant market approval, deny approval or request additional information.
Compliance
 
During all phases of development (pre- and post-marketing), failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s imposition of a clinical hold on a trial, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.

Special Regulatory Procedures
 
The FDA has developed distinct approaches to make new drugs and biologics available as rapidly as possible in cases where there is no available treatment or there are advantages over existing treatments. For example, the FDA may grant “Accelerated Approval” to products that have been studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments. For Accelerated Approval, the product must influence a surrogate endpoint or an intermediate clinical endpoint that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a product candidate, such as an effect on irreversible morbidity and mortality. When approval is based on surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints, other than survival or morbidity, the sponsor will be required to conduct additional post-approval clinical studies to verify and describe clinical benefit. These studies are known in as confirmatory trials. Accelerated Approval of a product may be withdrawn, or the labeled indication of the drug changed if these trials fail to verify clinical benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the product candidate.
 
The FDA may grant “Fast Track” status to products that treat serious diseases or conditions and fill an unmet medical need. Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of such products by providing, among other things, more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the product’s development plan, more frequent written correspondence from the FDA about trial design, eligibility for Accelerated Approval if relevant criteria are met and rolling review, which allows submission of individually completed sections of a NDA or a BLA for regulatory agency review before the entire submission is completed. Fast Track status does not ensure that a product will be developed more quickly or receive regulatory agency approval.
 
The FDA’s “Breakthrough Therapy” designation for a product candidate is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs and biologics that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies in terms of a clinically significant endpoint. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as Breakthrough Therapies, robust FDA-sponsor interaction and communication can help to identify the most efficient and expeditious path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective “control” regimens.
 
The FDA may grant “Priority Review” status to product candidates that, if approved, would provide significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. Priority Review is intended to reduce the time it takes for the FDA to review a NDA or a BLA, with the goal to act on the application within six months.
 
Orphan Drug Status
 
In accordance with laws and regulations pertaining to regulatory agencies, a sponsor may request that the regulatory agencies designate a drug or biologic intended to treat a “Rare Disease or Condition” as an “Orphan Drug.” For example, in the U.S., a “Rare Disease or Condition” is defined as one which affects less than 200,000 people in the U.S., or which affects more than 200,000 people but for which the cost of developing and making available the product is not expected to be recovered from sales of the product in the U.S. Upon the approval of the first NDA or BLA for a drug or biologic designated as an Orphan Drug for a specified indication, the sponsor of that NDA or BLA is entitled to 7 years of exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. for the drug or biologic for the particular indication unless the sponsor cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities to meet the needs of persons with the disease. In Europe, this exclusivity is 10 years. However, Orphan Drug status for an approved indication does not prevent another company from seeking approval of a drug that has other labeled indications that are not under orphan or other exclusivities. An Orphan Drug may also be eligible for federal income tax credits for costs associated with the disease state, the strength and complexity of the data presented, the novelty of the target or compound, the risk-management approval and whether multiple rounds of review are required for the agency to evaluate the submission. There is no guarantee that a potential treatment will receive marketing approval or that decisions on marketing approvals or treatment indications will be consistent across geographic areas.
Priority Review and Accelerated Review
 
Based on results of a Phase 3 clinical trial submitted in a NDA or a BLA, upon the request of an applicant, a priority review designation may be granted to a product by the FDA, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months from the FDA’s decision on priority review application, or eight months from the NDA filing. Priority review is given where preliminary estimates indicate that a product, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists, or a significant improvement compared to marketed products is possible. If criteria are not met for priority review, the standard FDA review period is ten months from the FDA’s decision on priority review application, or 12 months from the NDA or BLA filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.

Under a centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA is 210 days (excluding “clock stops,” when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”)). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, for example, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, which takes into consideration: (i) the seriousness of the disease (e.g., heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases) to be treated; (ii) the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and (iii) anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
 
Healthcare Reform
 
In March 2010, former President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, “Affordable Care Act”). The Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare will be delivered and financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. The Affordable Care Act is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the Affordable Care Act’s provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:

• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any covered entity engaged in manufacturing or importing certain branded prescription drugs and biological products, apportioned among such entities in accordance with their respective market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, to 23.1% and 13.0% of the Average Manufacturer Price (“AMP”), for most branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the scope of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, or Medicare Part D, coverage gap discount program in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50.0% point of sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133.0% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requirements to report annually specified financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, including reporting any “payments or transfers of value” made or distributed to prescribers, teaching hospitals, and other healthcare providers and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year, with data collection required beginning August 1, 2013 and reporting to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) required beginning March 31, 2014 and by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a mandatory nondeductible payment for employers with 50 or more full time employees (or equivalents) who fail to provide certain minimum health insurance coverage for such employees and their dependents, beginning in 2015 (pursuant to relief enacted by the Treasury Department).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Affordable Care Act also established an Independent Payment Advisory Board (“IPAB”) to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending. Beginning in 2014, the IPAB was mandated to propose changes in Medicare payments if it determines that the rate of growth of Medicare expenditures exceeds target growth rates. The IPAB has broad discretion to propose policies to reduce expenditures that may have a negative impact on payment rates for pharmaceutical and biologic products. A proposal made by the IPAB is required to be implemented by the CMS unless Congress adopts a proposal with savings greater than those proposed by the IPAB. The IPAB has not yet been called upon to act as the annual determinations by the CMS Office of the Actuary have not identified a savings target for implementation.

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (“Joint Select Committee”) to recommend proposals for spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. In January 2013, former President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our future customers, patients and third-party payors and, accordingly, our financial operations.
 
In January 2016, the CMS issued a final rule regarding the Medicaid drug rebate program. The final rule, effective April 1, 2016, among other things, revises the way the “average manufacturer price” is to be calculated by manufacturers participating in the program and implements certain amendments to the Medicaid rebate statute created under the Affordable Care Act. Also, there has been significant negative publicity and increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. It is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, products financial condition and results of operations.
 
We anticipate that the Affordable Care Act and other legislative reforms will result in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, if covered, and could seriously harm our business, though we are still unsure what its full impact will be. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect such challenges and amendments to continue in the future. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.
 
Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may compromise our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. At the same time, there have been significant ongoing efforts to modify or eliminate the Affordable Care Act. For example, the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (“Tax Act”), enacted on December 22, 2017, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code, commonly referred to as the individual mandate, beginning in 2019.
 
The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the repeal will result in over 13 million Americans losing their health insurance coverage over the next ten years and is likely to lead to increases in insurance premiums. Further legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act remain possible. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law proposed to replace the Affordable Care Act would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. Newly enacted FDA regulations may require us to expend additional resources to obtain or maintain regulatory approval. For example, in August 2017 President Trump signed into law the Food & Drug Administration Reauthorization Act (“FDARA”). This legislation imposes significant new requirements for clinical trial sponsors which will affect, among other things, the development of drugs and biological products for pediatric use. This legislation may result in new regulations, which may affect future options or timelines for regulatory approval.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all the FDA-approved drugs for a certain indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates, if approved, may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

Existing federal law requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates to state governments, based on a statutory formula, on covered outpatient drugs reimbursed by the Medicaid program as a condition of having their drugs paid for by AMP. AMP is determined by a statutory formula that is based on prices defined in the statute. AMP must be calculated for all products that are covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid program and be the “best price.” Best price must be calculated only for those covered outpatient drugs that are a single source drug or innovator multiple source drug, such as biologic products. Manufacturers are required to report AMP and best price for each of their covered outpatient drugs to the government on a regular basis. Additionally, some state Medicaid programs have imposed a requirement for supplemental rebates over and above the formula set forth in federal law as a condition for coverage. In addition to the Medicaid rebate program, federal law also requires that if a pharmaceutical manufacturer wishes to have its outpatient drugs covered under Medicaid as well as under Medicare Part B, it must sign a “Master Agreement” obligating it to provide a formulaic discount of approximately 24%, known as the federal ceiling price for drugs sold to the U.S. Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, the Public Health Service and the Coast Guard, and also provide discounts through a drug pricing agreement meeting the requirements of Section 340B of the PHSA for outpatient drugs sold to certain specified eligible healthcare organizations. The formula for determining the discounted purchase price under the 340B drug pricing program is defined by statute and is based on the AMP and rebate amount for a product as calculated under the Medicaid drug rebate program discussed above.
 
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the E.U. governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become more intense.
 
Thus, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. The E.U. provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. We may face competition for our product candidates from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 
The marketability of any product for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. Also, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time.
 
Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
In the U.S., our activities are potentially subject to additional regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the CMS, other divisions of the HHS and its Office of Inspector General, the Office for Civil Rights that has jurisdiction over matters relating to individuals’ privacy and protected health information, the DOJ, individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ and state and local governments.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare program. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted broadly to proscribe arrangements and conduct where only one purpose of the remuneration between the parties was to induce or reward referrals. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are several statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability. Failure to meet all the requirements of an applicable safe harbor or statutory exemption, however, does not make the arrangement or conduct per se unlawful under the Anti-Kickback Statute; instead, in such cases, the legality of the arrangement would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a consideration of all the facts and circumstances to ascertain the parties’ intent.

Moreover, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act, as discussed below.
 
The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. Through a modification made to the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved—and thus non-reimbursable—uses. The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Also, many states have additional similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the type of payor.
 
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” such as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons. It also gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing these actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect - thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act under the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations also require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals. It also requires reporting annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and payments or other “transfers of value” made to such physician owners. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”. Manufacturers were required to begin collecting data on August 1, 2013 and submit reports on aggregate payment data to the government for the first reporting period of August 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013, by March 31, 2014. They are also required to report detailed payment data for the first reporting period and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data by June 30, 2014. Thereafter, manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. The CMS made all reported data publicly available starting on September 30, 2014. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose additional restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices and/ or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare providers and entities.
 
To distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in some states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing products as they move through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives. They also prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing specified physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit other specified sales and marketing practices. All our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties. These include criminal and civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter supply contracts and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any of these could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 
Controlled Substances Regulation
 
Our product candidates involving Cannabis contain controlled substances, as defined in the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (“CSA”). The CSA and its implementing regulations establish a “closed system” of regulations for controlled substances. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements under the oversight of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”). The DEA is the federal agency responsible for regulating controlled substances. It requires those individuals or entities that manufacture, import, export, distribute, research, or dispense controlled substances to comply with the regulatory requirements to prevent the diversion of controlled substances to illicit channels of commerce.
 
The DEA categorizes controlled substances into one of five schedules—Schedule I, II, III, IV or V—with varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. Schedule I substances have a high potential for abuse, have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the U.S. and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision. They may be used only in federally approved research programs and may not be marketed or sold for dispensing to patients in the U.S. Pharmaceutical products having a currently accepted medical use that are otherwise approved for marketing may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule I substances presenting the highest potential for abuse and physical or psychological dependence. Schedule V substances present the lowest relative potential for abuse and dependence. The regulatory requirements are more restrictive for Schedule II substances than Schedule III substances. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist in most situations and cannot be refilled.
 
Following NDA approval of a drug containing a Schedule I controlled substance, that substance must be rescheduled as a Schedule II, III, IV or V substance before it can be marketed. On November 17, 2015, H.R. 639, Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act, passed through both houses of Congress. On November 25, 2015, the bill was signed into law. The law removes uncertainty associated with timing of the DEA rescheduling process after NDA approval. Specifically, it requires DEA to issue an “interim final rule,” pursuant to which a manufacturer may market its product within 90 days of FDA approval. The law also preserves the period of orphan marketing exclusivity for the full seven years such that this period only begins after DEA scheduling. This contrasts with the previous situation whereby the orphan “clock” began to tick upon FDA approval, even though the product could not be marketed until DEA scheduling was complete.
 
Facilities that manufacture, distribute, import or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA registration is specific to the location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are required for importation and manufacturing activities, and each registration authorizes which schedules of controlled substances the registrant may handle. However, certain coincident activities are permitted without obtaining a separate DEA registration, such as distribution of controlled substances by the manufacturer that produces them.
 
The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, recordkeeping, reporting and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration. The specific security requirements vary by the type of business activity and the schedule and quantity of controlled substances handled. The most stringent requirements apply to manufacturers of Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures commonly include background checks on employees and physical control of controlled substances through storage in approved vaults, safes and cages, and through use of alarm systems and surveillance cameras. An application for a manufacturing registration as a bulk manufacturer for a Schedule I or II substance must be published in the Federal Register and is open for 30 days to permit interested persons to submit comments, objections or requests for a hearing. A copy of the notice of the Federal Register publication is forwarded by DEA to all those registered, or applicants for registration, as bulk manufacturers of that substance. Once registered, manufacturing facilities must maintain records documenting the manufacture, receipt and distribution of all controlled substances. Manufacturers must submit periodic reports to the DEA of the distribution of Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III narcotic substances and other designated substances. Registrants must also report any controlled substance thefts or significant losses and must obtain authorization to destroy or dispose of controlled substances. As with applications for registration as a bulk manufacturer, an application for an importer registration for a Schedule I or II substance must also be published in the Federal Register, which remains open for 30 days for comments. Imports of Schedule I and II controlled substances for commercial purposes are generally restricted to substances not already available from domestic supplier or where there is not adequate competition among domestic suppliers. In addition to an importer or exporter registration, importers and exporters must obtain a permit for every import or export of a Schedule I and II substance or Schedule III, IV and V narcotic, and submit import or export declarations for Schedule III, IV and V non-narcotics. In some cases, Schedule III non-narcotic substances may be subject to the import/export permit requirement, if necessary, to ensure that the U.S. complies with its obligations under international drug control treaties.

For drugs manufactured in the U.S., the DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for substances within Schedules I and II that may be manufactured or produced in the U.S. based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate medical, scientific research and industrial needs. This limited aggregate amount of Cannabis that the DEA allows to be produced in the U.S. each year is allocated among individual companies, which, in turn, must annually apply to the DEA for individual manufacturing and procurement quotas. The quotas apply equally to the manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and production of dosage forms. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas a few times per year and individual manufacturing or procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether to make such adjustments for individual companies.
 
The states also maintain separate controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution and dispensing requirements. State authorities, including boards of pharmacy, regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution.
 
Patents, Intellectual Property and Trade Secrets
 
Intellectual property (“IP”) and patent protection are of paramount importance to our business, as are the trade secrets and other strategies we have employed with Austrianova to protect the proprietary Cell-in-a-Box® technology. Although we believe we take reasonable measures to protect our IP and trade secrets and those of Austrianova, we cannot guarantee we will be able to protect and enforce our IP or obtain international patent protection for our product candidates as needed. We license technology and trademarks relating to three areas: (i) live cell encapsulation with cells that express cytochrome P450 where the capsule is permeable to prodrug molecules and the cells are retained within the capsules; (ii) treatment of solid cancerous tumors and (ii) encapsulation of cells for producing retroviral particles for gene therapy. We also have exclusive worldwide licensing rights to patents, trademarks and know-how using Cell-in-a-Box® technology in the diabetes field and in the treatment of diseases and related conditions using cannabinoids.
 
Litigation may be required to protect our product candidates, IP rights and trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Maintenance of our IP utilizes financial and operational resources. In addition, the possibility exists that our IP could be discovered to be owned by others, be invalid or be unenforceable - potentially bringing unforeseen challenges to us.

We entered into the amendments contemplated by the Binding Term Sheet (“Binding Term Sheet Amendments”). The Binding Term Sheet Amendments provide that our obligation to make milestone payments to Austrianova will be eliminated in their entirety under the: (i) Cannabis License Agreement; and (ii) the Diabetes License Agreement, as amended. The Binding Term Sheet Amendments also provides that our obligation to make milestone payments to SG Austria pursuant to the SG Austria APA, as amended and clarified, is eliminated in their entirety. One of the Binding Term Sheet Amendments also provides that the scope of the Diabetes License Agreement is expanded to include all cell types and cell lines of any kind or description now or later identified, including, but not limited to, primary cells, mortal cells, immortal cells and stem cells at all stages of differentiation and from any source specifically designed to produce insulin for the treatment of diabetes.
 
In addition, one of the Binding Term Sheet Amendments provides that we have a 5-year right of first refusal from August 30, 2017 in the event that Austrianova chooses to sell, transfer or assign at any time during this period the Cell-in-a-Box® technology, tradename and Associated Technologies; provided, however, that the Associated Technologies subject to the right of first refusal do not include Bac-in-a-Box
 
The Binding Term Sheet Amendments further provide that: (i) the royalty payments on gross sales as specified in the SG Austria APA, the Cannabis License Agreement and the Diabetes License Agreement are changed to 4%; and (ii) the royalty payments on amounts received by us from sublicensees on sublicensees’ gross sales under the same agreements are changed to 20% of the amount received by us from our sublicensees, provided, however, that in the event the amounts received by us from sublicensees is 4% or less of sublicensees’ gross sales, Austrianova will receive 50% of what we receive (up to 2%) and then additionally 20% of any amount we receive over that 4%.
 
The Binding Term Sheet Amendments also provide that Austrianova will receive 50% of any other financial and non-financial consideration received from our sublicensees of the Cell-in-a-Box® technology.
 
The Melligen Cell License Agreement provides us with an exclusive worldwide license, with a right to sublicense, to use genetically modified human cells that have been modified to comprise pancreas islet cell glucokinase for use in developing a therapy for diabetes.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
The entire encapsulation process relating to the encapsulation of the cells for the oncology and diabetes-based therapies we are developing is to be carried out by Austrianova. Austrianova is responsible for acquiring all of the necessary raw materials used in this process, including the cellulose sulfate necessary for encapsulating the live cells. As mentioned above, we engaged ViruSure to clone new cells from a selected clone. Those cells have been grown by Eurofins to populate a MCB for our future clinical trials. See also “—Manufacturing” in this Item 1. “Business.”
