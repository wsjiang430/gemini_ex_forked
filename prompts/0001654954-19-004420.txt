ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
 Corporate History
  
 We were originally incorporated under the name Plae, Inc., in the State of Arizona on August 20, 1999. At the time we operated under the name Plae, Inc., no business was conducted. No books or records were maintained and no meetings were held. In essence, nothing was done after incorporation until Glenn E. Martin took possession of Plae, Inc. in January 2005. On February 18, 2005, the corporate name was changed to King Mines, Inc. and then subsequently changed to its current name, United Mines, Inc., on March 30, 2005. No shares were issued until the Company became United Mines, Inc. From 2005 until 2015, we were an exploration stage mineral exploration company that owned a number of unpatented BLM mining claims and Arizona State Land Department exploration leases.
  
 On November 26, 2014, our Board of Directors approved the redomestication of our company from Arizona to Nevada (the “Articles of Domestication”), and approved Articles of Incorporation in Nevada, which differed from then-Articles of Incorporation in Arizona, primarily by (a) changing our name from United Mines, Inc. to WEED, Inc., (b) authorizing Twenty Million (20,000,000) shares of preferred stock, with blank check rights granted to our Board of Directors, and (c) authorizing Two Hundred Million (200,000,000) shares of common stock (the “Nevada Articles of Incorporation”). On December 19, 2014, the holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock approved the Articles of Domestication and the Nevada Articles of Incorporation at a Special Meeting of Shareholders. On January 16, 2015, the Articles of Domestication and the Nevada Articles of Incorporation went effective with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. On February 2, 2015, our name change to WEED, Inc., and a corresponding ticker symbol change to “BUDZ” went effective with FINRA and was reflected on the quotation of our common stock on OTC Markets.
  
 These changes were effected in order to make our corporate name and ticker symbol better align with our short-term and long-term business focus, which in the short-term is to conduct a Cannabis Genomic Study over the next 5 years, process those results, and in the long-term to be an international cannabis research and product development company, with a globally-recognized brand focusing on building and purchasing labs, land and building commercial grade “Cultivation Centers” to consult, assist, manage & lease to universities, state governments, licensed dispensary owners and worldwide organic grow operators on a contract basis, with a concentration on the legal and medical Cannabis sector. These operations are being conducted through our primary wholly-owned subsidiary, Sangre AT, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (“Sangre”). Our long-term plan is to become a True “Seed-to-Sale” global holding company providing infrastructure, financial solutions, product development and real estate options in this new emerging market. Our long term plans may also include acquisitions of synergistic businesses, such as distilleries to make infused beverages and/or super oxygenated water with CBD and THC.

  ITEM 1 – BUSINESS (CONTINUED)
  
 As of December 31, 2018, in addition to Sangre, we had two other wholly-owned subsidiaries, namely WEED Australia Ltd., an Australian corporation, and WEED Israel Cannabis Ltd., an Israeli corporation. WEED Australia is registered as an unlisted public company in Australia. Both subsidiaries were formed to address future anticipated global demand and to take advantage of countries that have more developed laws related to cannabis.
  
 Our corporate offices are located at 4920 N. Post Trail, Tucson, AZ 85750, telephone number (520) 818-8582.
  
  Business Overview
  
  General
  
 We are an early stage holding company currently focused on the development and application of cannabis-derived compounds for the treatment of human disease. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Sangre, has begun a planned five-year Cannabis Genomic Study, to complete a genetic blueprint of the Cannabis plant genus, by creating a global genomic classification of the entire plant. By targeting cannabis-derived molecules that stimulate the endocannabinoid system, Sangre’s research team plans to develop scientifically-valid and evidence-based cannabis strains for the production of disease-specific medicines. The goal of the research is to identify, collect, patent, and archive a collection of highly-active medicinal strains. We plan to conduct this study only in states where cannabis has been legalized for medicinal purposes.
  
 Using annotated genomic data and newly generated phenotypic data, Sangre plans to identify and isolate regions of the plant genome which are related to growth, synthesis of desired molecules, and drought and pest resistance. This complex data set would then be utilized in a breeding program to generate and establish new hybrid cultivars which exemplify the traits that are desired by the medical and patient community. This breeding program would produce new seed stocks and clones, which we plan on patenting. If successful this intellectual property should generate immense value for the Company. After developing a comprehensive understanding of the annotated genome of a variety of cannabis strains, and obtaining intellectual property protection over the most promising strains, we plan to move forward either independently or with strategic partners to develop medicinal products for the treatment of a multitude of human diseases.
  Our current, short-term goals relate to the Cannabis Genomic Study and the resulting development of a variety of new cannabis strains, and, over the next 5 years, we plan to process those results in order to become an international cannabis research and product development company, with a globally-recognized brand focusing on building and purchasing labs, land and building commercial grade “Cultivation Centers” to consult, assist, manage & lease to universities, state governments, licensed dispensary owners and organic grow operators on a contract basis with a concentration on the legal and medical cannabis sector.
  
 Our long-term plan is to become a true “Seed-to-Sale” global holding company providing infrastructure, financial solutions, product development, and real estate options in this new emerging market. Our long term growth may also come from the acquisition of synergistic businesses, such as distilleries, to make anything from infused beverages to super oxygenated water with CBD and THC. Currently, WEED, Inc. has formed WEED Australia Ltd., registered as an unlisted public company in Australia to address this global demand. We have also formed WEED Israel Cannabis Ltd., an Israeli corporation, to address future global demand, and in March 2019, WEED Israel Cannabis Ltd. was involved in the transaction with Yissum discussed herein. In 2018, we formed a non-profit company in Australia called Cannabis Institute of Australia Limited. To date this company has been dormant.
  
 As of December 31, 2018, the original Sangre’s research team is no longer with the Company, and the new research team consists of individuals who reside throughout the country. The property manager is the only individual who is currently located at the site in La Veta.

  Cannabis Genomic Study
  
 After more than 40 years of illicit, underground breeding programs, the genetic integrity of Cannabis has been significantly degraded.  Our subsidiary, Sangre AT, LLC (“Sangre”) plans to use a gene-based breeding program to root out inferior cultivars and replace them with fully-validated and patentable cultivars which produce consistent plant products for the medicinal markets. We believe our unique gene-based breeding program will improve cultivars and introduce integrity, stability, and quality to the market in the following ways:
  
 ● Accelerated and optimized growth rates; modern genomic resources will enhance traditional breeding methods
  
 ● Generation of new cultivars, accelerating and perfecting the art of selective breeding
  
 ● Provide the ability to assay for specific genes within the crop, which is critical to strain tracking and market quality assurance
  
 ● Improve disease and drought resistance
  
 We believe our gene-based breeding program will facilitate and accelerate:
  
 ● Improved therapeutic properties
  
 ● New therapies for migraines/chronic pain, epilepsy, cancer, PTSD, chronic head injury, and others
  
 ● Enhanced opportunities for new drug discovery through collaborations with national medical research and treatment centers and Bio-pharma companies
  
 ● Development and protection of intellectual property
  
  The Research Plan
  
 In order to achieve the desired results outlined above, Sangre has developed a research plan entitled the “Cannabis Genomic Study.” The goal of the study is to complete a global genomic classification of the Cannabis plant genus. Once the classification is complete, the research team plans to develop new cannabis strains that show the highest likelihood of being successful in the treatment of a variety of human diseases, test those strains and then work to produce those strains in a medicinal form for the treatment of disease. The research plan will be conducted using the following steps: Extraction, Purification, Sequencing. Annotation, and Cloning (micro-propagation).
  
 Extraction: The extraction of genomic DNA from cannabis is a complex process of cell lysis and DNA recovery. Sangre has evaluated, updated, and validated new methods for DNA recovery.
  
 Purification: Using next generation purification chemistries, the DNA is cleaned and concentrated for downstream applications.
  
 Sequencing: The Cannabis DNA is sequenced using both the Illumina MiSeq and MinIon instruments.
  
 Annotation: The genomic data is assembled and annotated using proprietary bioinformatic systems and the data provided to the Sangre AgroTech genetic breeders and cellular cloners.
  
 Cloning: Through this process, new, high-value cannabis strains are developed.

  ITEM 1 – BUSINESS (CONTINUED)
 
 The objectives of the research plan are as follows:
  
 Technical Objective 1: Using two next generation sequencing platforms and proprietary bioinformatics programs, we will sequence five cultivars of Cannabis, and generate fully annotated genomic data.
  
 Technical Objective 2: Using the selected cultivars, backcross and forward hybridization studies will be performed to produce a new generation of stock. The progeny of these crosses will be grown, genetically finger-printed, and introduced to the market under patent protection. Up-selection and cultivation of cultivars for quality assurance.
  
 Technical Objective 3: Genotypic and phenotypic measurements of the offspring will be performed using Next Generation Sequence Analysis, Genotyping, and Phenotyping analysis. Product focus groups will evaluate new cultivars. Patent protection will be initiated for new cultivars which meet product development criteria.
  
 Technical Objective 4: Utilize gene-driven breeding of up-selected cultivars to initiate the generation of “designer” cultivars for clinical research.
  
 Technical Objective 5: Market placement of selected, genetically enhanced cultivars for the medicinal and bio-pharma markets.
  
  Where We Are in the Research Plan
  
 As noted above, phase one of our planned five year “Cannabis Genomic Study” is “extraction”. On April 20, 2017, Sangre initiated the genomic study by extracting DNA from seven cannabis strains in Tucson, Arizona. Sangre followed the initial extraction with a second round of extractions in July 2017. The extracted DNA is currently being sequenced by the Sangre team using a binary sequencing approach based on the use of two distinct sequencing technologies and a proprietary bioinformatics database. Following the generation of genomic data, the sequences will be annotated (compared) against over 300,000 plant genes to elucidate specific de novo pathways responsible for the synthesis of specific compounds and classes of compounds.
  
 As noted herein, on July 26, 2017, we acquired property located in La Veta, Colorado in order for Sangre to complete its 5-Year, $15+ million Cannabis Genomic Study. The acquisition of this property was not essential for the Sangre team to begin the extraction and sequencing phases, however, once completed, the property will allow Sangre to expand the genomic study. The facility is currently under re-design and renovation to convert the existing structures into a world-class genetics research center. Additionally, under the genome project directives, additional strains are slated for sequencing and annotation as part of the overall expansion of this research project. An integral part of this expansion is the acquisition of additional DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing technologies. The expansion also includes the installation of high-level IT networks for data acquisition, analysis, and storage. The La Veta property, when completed will allow us to expand the scope of the study, as well as, complete the future steps in the study. Once completed, the La Veta facility will also contain laboratories for cellular cloning, in vitro protoplast fusions, and plant developmental studies.
  
 Competitive Advantages
  
 Sangre’s research and development team works with next generation sequencing (NGS) and emerging third generation instruments, and has developed the most advanced proprietary bioinformatics data systems available. Sangre uses a unique two sequencing approach. One system provides DNA reads of up to 300,000 base pair reads and an NGS system which provides highly accurate short reads. This allows the genomic data to be assembled in a scaffold construct; the long reads forming the scaffold and the short reads providing highly accurate verification and quality assurance of the genomic data. This approach, together with the bioinformatics program, facilitates a highly accurate construct of the Cannabis genome which can be annotated and facilitate gene discovery and gene location. Sangre combination of personnel, skill-sets, and data analytics capabilities will allow us to accomplish our goals in months, rather than years.

  ITEM 1 – BUSINESS (CONTINUED)
 
 Using annotated genomic data and newly generated phenotypic data, we plan to identify and isolate regions of the genome which are related to growth, synthesis of desired molecules, and environmental compatibility. This complex data set will be utilized in a breeding program to generate and establish new hybrid cultivars which exemplify the traits that are desired by the medical community. This breeding program will produce new seed stocks, clones, cultivars, and intellectual property which will generate value for the business organization.
  
 Sangre will develop a translational breeding program to establish a new collection of Cannabis cultivars for the national market. Using genetic screening technology and micro-propagation, cultivars can be up-selected for specific traits and grown to address the needs of consumers in the medicinal and drug discovery markets. The combination of next generation genomics, selective hybridization, and In Vitro cloning provide us with the tools to enhance new cultivars of patentable Cannabis.
  
  Marketing
  
 We have not developed a marketing plan and do not intend to until we are in the latter stages of the Cannabis Genomic Study and believe we have strains that are marketable for the treatment of disease. At that time we plan to develop a marketing plan for our newly-developed strains of Cannabis. We believe that if we are successful in developing strains of Cannabis that effectively treat human diseases then the market for our products will be a vibrant market.
 Manufacturing
  
 We are not currently manufacturing any products and do not intend to do so until we are in the latter stages of the Cannabis Genomic Study and believe we have strains that are marketable for the treatment of disease such that we could begin the manufacturing of such products, either in-house or through relationships with third party companies. We do not currently have any relationships with third party companies for the manufacturing of any products.
 Competition
  
 The cannabis industry, taken as a whole, is an emerging industry with many new entrants, with some of them focused on research, some on medicinal cannabis and others focused on cannabis for legal, adult use, i.e. “recreational” use. We are focused solely on the research and medicinal cannabis part of the industry. Additionally, many cannabis companies are international companies due to the restrictions on the cannabis industry in the U.S.
  
 At this point in our development, we believe our competitors are those companies that are attempting study and sequence cannabis DNA with the goal of creating medicines from that research. We do not view ourselves in competition with those companies currently growing and/or selling cannabis for medicinal or recreational use since we are a research company. We are aware of companies that supply synthetic cannabinoids and cannabis extracts to researchers for pre-clinical and clinical investigation. We are also aware of various companies that cultivate cannabis plants with a view to supplying herbal cannabis or non-pharmaceutical cannabis-based formulations to patients. These activities have not been approved by the FDA.

  ITEM 1 – BUSINESS (CONTINUED)

 We have never endorsed or supported the idea of distributing or legalizing crude herbal cannabis, or preparations derived from crude herbal cannabis for medical use and do not believe our research to hopefully create prescription cannabinoids are the same, and therefore competitive, with crude herbal cannabis. We believe that only a cannabinoid medication, one that is standardized in composition, formulation and dose, administered by means of an appropriate delivery system, and tested in properly controlled pre-clinical and clinical studies, can meet the standards of regulatory authorities around the world, including those of the FDA. We believe that any cannabinoid medication must be subjected to, and satisfy, such rigorous scrutiny through proper accredited education and federal regulations.
  
 As Cannabis has moved through the legalization process in North America, research groups in Canada and the Unites States have initiated work on understanding the Cannabis genome.
  
 The methods of competition for companies in the cannabis research market segment revolve around a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, experience of the company’s research team, the facilities used by the company to conduct research, the instrumentation used to sequence DNA, the company’s internal research protocols, and the company’s relationship with those in the scientific community.
  
 Applying those competitive factors to WEED, Inc.: our research team averages over 15 years of experience (including peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations), we have dedicated over 14,000 square feet of research space to the resolution of cannabis genomics and the development of new strains, our instrumentation is designed to sequence large pieces of DNA (>25,000 bp - 10 times larger than our typical competitors), and we use custom bioinformatics (DNA sequence analysis software) not available to any other competitor in the industry. We believe these factors, along with our strong relationships in the industry and our unique validation protocols, will allow us to measure up favorably when compared to our competition.
  
  Next Generation Sequencing
  
 Next-generation sequencing (NGS), introduced nearly ten years ago, is the catch-all term used to describe several sequencing technologies including:
  
 ● Illumina (Solexa) sequencing
  
 ● Roche 454 sequencing
  
 ● Ion torrent: Proton / PGM sequencing
  
 ● SOLiD sequencing
  
 These recent sequencing technologies allow scientists to sequence DNA and RNA much more quickly and cheaply than the previously used Sanger sequencing, and as such, have greatly expanded the study of genomics and molecular biology. Numerous laboratories within the Cannabis community are currently employing this technology.
 Colorado State University – Boulder
  
 To the best of our knowledge, Colorado State University – Boulder is conducting a Cannabis Genomic Research Initiative, which is currently seeking to describe the Cannabis genome. The data generated through this effort is provided through the public domain to growers in an effort to stimulate the production of new, high-value stains of Cannabis.
 Anandia Labs
  
 Anandia Labs is conducting work in the area of Cannabis genomics based on sequence work which was completed in 2011. The sequencing work conducted was based on “next generation sequencing” technology and resulted in the generation of tens-of-thousands of DNA segments that have yet to be completely and correctly reassembled. Much of the sequence data that was generated through their sequencing efforts has been placed into the public domain and shared with other laboratories. In some instances, the data has been found to be less than accurate.

  ITEM 1 – BUSINESS (CONTINUED)
 
  Phylos Biosciences
  
 Phylos Biosciences is currently using DNA-based genetic fingerprinting to establish relationships between strains and to assist in the development of phenotypic databases to accelerate traditional breeding programs. Phylos Biosciences has a primary goal of bringing clarity to the Cannabis market and promote the generation of IP held by individual growers. To the best of our knowledge, Phylos Biosciences is not engaged in whole genome sequencing and is not engaged in any genetic enhancements of the Cannabis strains. They simply supply genetic data to their customer base to more effectively drive the traditional breeding process.
 New West Genetics
  
 New West Genetics aims to improve and develop industrial hemp as a viable crop for the United States. New West Genetics seeks to exploit the diverse end uses of hemp and optimize the genetics of hemp to create a lucrative crop to add to the rotation of US farmers. Industrial hemp’s uses and potential are as great as many major crops, if not more. We believe NWG is utilizing modern sequencing technology and statistical genomics approaches to understand these factors as they apply to hemp production in states where it is legal to grow. Understanding the genotype to phenotype map will be increasingly useful for expanding production of hemp.
  
 While we do not believe any of the above companies or universities are direct competitors of ours based on what we believe about their work in the industry, they could be competitors for research funding dollars. We are not aware of the financial situation of many of the above companies and universities, but we will need to raise substantial additional capital in order to fully-fund the five year genomic study and the facilities to complete the study. Most of the above companies and universities are likely better financed than we are and we will need to raise substantial funds in order to compete in the cannabis research industry.
  
  Intellectual Property
  
 On March 1, 2019, we entered into an Exclusive License and Assignment Agreement (the “Technology Agreement”) with Yissum Research Development Company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalam, Ltd., an entity organized in Israel (“Yissum”). Under the terms of the Technology Agreement, Yissum agreed to grant an exclusive license, and eventually assign, to us certain platform technologies relating to different formulations for administration and delivery of lipophilic compositions, (including cannabinoids) (collectively, the “Technology”) invented and/or developed by Prof. Elka Touitou at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which technologies are more fully described in the patent applications and/or patents listed in Appendix A to the Technology Agreement.
  
 Under the Agreement, in exchange for an exclusive license to use the Existing Technologies, we will pay Yissum a total of USD$1,000,000 as follows: (i) $100,000 within three (3) business days of signing the Technology Agreement (which amount has been paid), (ii) $400,000 on or before May 1, 2019, and (iii) $500,000 on or before December 31, 2019 (together, the “License Payments”). The grant of the exclusive license and the transfer to us of the responsibility for the administration and control of patent activities and patent expenses related to the Existing Technologies occurs after the USD$400,000 payment due May 1, 2019.
  
 The intent of the parties is that we will have the exclusive license until such time as the Existing Technologies are assigned to WEED, Inc.. In order to receive the assignments and own the five (5) patents and the Technologies, in addition to the License Payments we must pay Yissum a total of USD$1,000,000, with $300,000 due on or before June 1, 2020 and $700,000 on or before September 1, 2020. Additionally, we will owe Yissum an additional USD$1,500,000 upon the earlier of the following events: (i) the first commercial sale of a pharmaceutical product based on the Technology, or (ii) the later of: (a) the first commercial sale of any product based on the Technology, and (b) when we receive an aggregate of USD$1,500,000 in gross revenue from all sales of products based on the Technology.

  ITEM 1 – BUSINESS (CONTINUED)
 
 The description of the Technology Agreement set forth in this report is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of that document, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on March 7, 2019 and is incorporated herein by reference.
  
 Additionally, we consider certain elements of our Cannabis Genomic Study to be trade secrets and we protect it as our intellectual property. In the future, if we are successful in identifying certain Cannabis strains as promising for the treatment of diseases we will seek to patent those strains.
  
  Government Regulation
  
 As of the end of February 2017, 28 states and the District of Columbia allow its citizens to use medical marijuana. Voters in the states of Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon and the District of Columbia have approved ballot measures to legalize cannabis for adult use. The state laws are in conflict with the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. The prior administration (President Obama) effectively stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct law federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana. However, the Trump administration has indicated the potential for stricter enforcement of the marijuana industry at the federal level, but to date there has been very little in terms of action. There is no guarantee that the Trump administration or future administrations will maintain the low-priority enforcement of federal laws in the marijuana industry that was adopted by the Obama administration. The Trump administration or any new administration that follows could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws strongly. Any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to our business and our shareholders.
  
 Further, and while we do not intend to harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, if we conduct research with the cannabis plant or lease buildings to growers of marijuana, etc., we could be deemed to be participating in marijuana cultivation, which remains illegal under federal law, and exposes us to potential criminal liability, with the additional risk that our properties could be subject to civil forfeiture proceedings.
  
 Currently, there are no approvals needed in order to sequence the cannabis genome, which is what is currently being conducted by Sangre. However, prior to doing any research into the medical applications of the cannabis plant once the study is completed, we will need to obtain medicinal cannabis and hemp research licenses from the State of Colorado. Additionally, if we ever cultivate and process cannabis plants, we will need cultivation and processing licenses from the State of Colorado, which covers cannabis and hemp. These licenses will cost approximately $1,000 to $5,000 per license, and likely take approximately six months to obtain.
  
  Sangre Agreement
  
 On April 20, 2017, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Sangre AT, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company, under which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company membership units of Sangre in exchange for Five Hundred Thousand (500,000) shares of our common stock, restricted in accordance with Rule 144. As a result of this agreement, Sangre is a wholly-owned subsidiary of WEED, Inc.
 Employees
  
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed two people on a full time basis, namely Glenn E. Martin and Nicole M. Breen. We also contract with John Irvin, Thomas Perry, Andrew Defries, Jerrell Shaw, and Tom Pool on a full-time basis who work with Sangre. As of December 31, 2018, WEED Israel Cannabis Ltd. had one consultant. As of December 31, 2018, WEED Australia Ltd. had two consultants.

  Le Veta, Colorado Properties
  
 On July 26, 2017, we acquired property located in La Veta, Colorado in order for Sangre to complete its 5-Year, $15+ million Cannabis Genomic Study. The site includes a 10,000+ sq. ft. building that will house Sangre’s genomic research facility, a 4,000+ square foot building for plant product analytics and plant product extraction, a 3,500 sq. ft. corporate office center, and 25 RV slots with full water and electric, which we plan to convert into a series of small research pods. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we paid $525,000 down, including 25,000 shares of our common stock, and Sangre took immediate possession of the property. Under the terms of the purchase we were obligated to pay an additional $400,000 in cash and issue an additional 75,000 shares of our common stock over the next two years in order to pay the entire purchase price. On January 12, 2018, we entered into an Amendment No. 1 to the $475,000 principal amount promissory note issued by us to the seller of the property, under which both parties agreed to amend the purchase and the promissory note to allow us to payoff the note in full if we paid $100,000 in cash on or before January 15, 2018 and issued the seller 125,000 shares of common stock, restricted in accordance with Rule 144, on before January 20, 2018. Through an escrow process, we paid the seller $100,000 in cash and issued him 125,000 shares of common stock in accordance with the Amendment No. 1, in exchange for a full release of the deed of trust that was securing the promissory note, on January 17, 2018. As a result, the $475,000 principal promissory note issued to the seller is deemed paid-in-full and fully satisfied and we own the property without encumbrances. To date we have spent $354,000 renovating the property and an additional $400,000 on extraction and analytical lab equipment. We plan to complete the property renovations by Q3 of 2019, at an estimated cost of $300,000. We will need additional extraction equipment and analytical lab equipment, totaling approximately $700,000. We will need to raise additional funds in order to complete the planned renovations and pay the purchase price for the equipment.
  
 On January 3, 2018, Sangre closed on the purchase of a condominium in La Veta, Colorado. Sangre paid $140,000 in cash for the condominium which is a three story condominium, with three bedrooms and three bathrooms and is approximately 1,854 square feet. In February 2018, we closed on the purchase of property, consisting of a home in La Veta, Colorado to house company personnel and consultants for total consideration approximating $1,200,000. The home has 5 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we paid $150,000 down, entered into a note payable in the amount of approximately $1,041,000. We secured a below-market interest rate of 1.81% based on the short-term nature of the term. This note was repaid on October 5, 2018. Sangre took immediate possession of the property. We acquired these properties for the purpose of housing personnel we believe are vital to the 5-year Cannabis Genomic Study. La Veta, Colorado is a small town without many rentals, so it became necessary to find more permanent housing in La Veta, Colorado for those that will be working with Sangre on the study.
  
  New York Property
  
 On October 24, 2017, we entered into an amended Purchase and Sale Agreement with Greg DiPaolo’s Pro Am Golf, LLC (“DiPaolo”), under which we agreed to purchase certain improved property located in Westfield, New York from DiPaolo for a total purchase price of Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars ($800,000). Under the terms of the agreement, we paid a Ten Thousand Dollar ($10,000) deposit on October 26, 2017, with the remaining purchase price to be paid on or before the date closing date, which was originally scheduled for February 1, 2018. On February 19, 2018, we entered into a Second Addendum to the Purchase and Sale Agreement extending the closing date to May 1, 2018 in exchange for payment of $8,750. On May 1, 2018, we entered into a Fourth Addendum and a Fifth Addendum to agreement amending the “Closing Date” under the Agreement to August 1, 2018, in exchange for our payment of $50,000 as a non-refundable deposit to be applied against the purchase price when the property sale is completed and $10,000 for maintenance, tree removal and other grounds keeping in order to prepare the golf course for the 2018 season. The property is approximately 43 acres and has unlimited water extraction rights from the State of New York. We plan to use this property as our inroads to the New York hemp and infused beverage markets in the future. There are no current plans or budget to proceed with operations in New York, and there will not be until proper funding is secured after acquiring this property. The acquisition of this property has been delayed by extensions granted to certain parties by the Bankruptcy Court, which is governing the disposition of this property. Currently, there will be an open bid for the property, and there is no guarantee the Company will win the bid or ever complete the acquisition. As a result, the $110,000 non-refundable deposit was recorded as a loss on deposit at the end of December 31, 2018.
