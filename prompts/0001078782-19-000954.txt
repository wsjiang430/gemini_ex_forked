Item 1. Business
Background
 
We are a start-up company, engaged in the exploration, mining, extraction and recycling of battery metals. We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 6, 2011 for the purpose of acquiring rights to mineral properties with the eventual objective of being a producing mineral company, if and when it ever occurs. We have limited operating history and have not yet generated or realized any revenues from our activities. Our principal executive offices are located at 930 Tahoe Blvd., Suite 802-16, Incline Village, NV 89451.
 
We are actively exploring and drilling for lithium-rich brines and deposits from the Company’s claims covering 30,000 acres in Railroad Valley, Nevada. 
 
In our laboratory located in Silver Springs, Nevada, we have started developing a proprietary extraction technology to harvest lithium from brine for refinement into battery-grade lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide. 
 
In an incubator space provided by BASF Corporation and located in Greentown, Massachusetts, we began, in the first quarter of the 2020 fiscal year, to develop a closed-loop battery recycling process that separates and recovers each individual elemental metal from end-of-life batteries, as well as from defects and waste from battery manufacturing facilities. These recovered metals will be refined up to battery-grade specifications and then sold.
 
Currently, the Board of Directors (consisting of Mr. Douglas Cole, Mr. Douglas MacLellan and Mr. William Hunter) are involved in guiding the Company’s goals and objectives to solely focus on the exploration, extraction and recycling of Lithium (Li) and other battery metal deposits in the State of Nevada, primarily through new capital commitments which Mr. Cole is actively seeking.
 
On August 8, 2016, the Company formed Lithortech Resources Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company to serve as its operating subsidiary for lithium resource exploration and development. On June 29, 2018, the Company changed the name of Lithortech Resources to LithiumOre Corp. (“LithiumOre”). 
 
On May 3, 2019, the Company changed its name to American Battery Metals Corporation (“ABMC”) and reorganized into three divisions; Battery Metals Mining, Battery Metals Extraction and Battery Metals Recycling. ABMC currently has 1,300 mining claims on 30,000 acres in the area known as the Western Nevada Basin, situated in Railroad Valley in Nye County, Nevada (the “WNB Claim”). In the second half of 2017, we engaged experts to evaluate the region and the WNB Claim to target onsite exploration efforts and determined that the claims of the WNB Claim were appropriate for the Company’s planned exploration, which we began in the first half of 2019. With many features similar to Clayton Valley and with no exploration work targeting lithium to date, Railroad Valley represents a new and untested target for lithium brine. The Railroad Valley brine exploration can build on both the dense existing oil field data and the experiences at Clayton Valley and other Lithium brine basins to target potential brine aquifers. Please see the Company’s website for more information: www.batterymetals.com.
 
The growth in demand for lithium batteries is predicted by industry researchers to outpace lithium production in the coming decade. Lithium-ion batteries for the automotive industry are expected to advance demand beyond current supply. These industry trends support and validate the Company’s new business model.
 
The Company is currently a pre-revenue organization and we do not anticipate earning revenues until such time as we have undertaken sufficient exploration work to identify lithium and or other battery metals reserves. Exploration work will take several years and there is no certainty we will ever reach a production stage. Our Company is considered to be in the exploration stage due to not having done exploration work which would result in a development decision.
 
Market and Industry
 
Lithium is extracted from primarily two sources: pegmatite crystals and lithium salts from brine pools. Currently, the world’s top producers of Lithium are located in Australia, Chile, Argentina, and China. 
 
In 2018, worldwide Lithium production totaled approximately 85,000 metric tons, with the top 3 countries contributing roughly 89% of the global production. Most of the world’s lithium supply is produced by three companies: Albemarle Corporation, FMC Corporation, and Chile’s Sociedad Quimica Y Minera de Chile (SQM). Ganfeng and Tianqi of China are major players.

Much of the current production of Lithium in Australia is derived from conventional mining techniques of ancient Precambrian rocks containing Lithium ore which is crushed and fed into capital intensive processing plants which upgrade the lithium mineral using gravity, flotation, magnetic and roasting purification processes. 
 
Alternatively, Lithium production from Chile and Argentina uses a much less capital intense extraction method. Lithium is located beneath various salt flats. The Lithium is leached from nearby source rocks and becomes concentrated in salty brines just under the surface. The Lithium enriched brines are then pumped up to settle in multiple of shallow surface evaporation pools which produces a thicker Lithium rich liquid. That liquid is treated with sodium carbonate, which creates lithium carbonate. 
 
Lithium is a soft silver-white metal. With an atomic number of 3, it is the lightest of the all metals. Lightweight Lithium has many applications but the metal is a perfect replacement of the much heavier Nickel used in most large batteries. Lithium-ion batteries also have a high charge density, a longer life and are rechargeable.
 
The Lithium market has typically been dominated by the ceramic and medical sectors, however recently the demand for Lithium for the battery markets- to fuel electric vehicles and energy storage applications- outstripped any other sector.
 
The primary lithium-ion battery manufacturers by capacity are: CATL, BYD, Tesla, Panasonic of Japan, and LG Chem of South Korea.
 
Lithium is not currently traded on any commodity exchanges, but rather is usually distributed in a chemical form such as lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) and sold directly to end users for a negotiated price per ton of Lithium carbonate.
 
General Market Analysis
 
Lithium-ion batteries have become the rechargeable battery of choice in cell phones, computers, electric cars and now larger scale electric storage. The growth in demand for lithium batteries is predicted to far outpace lithium production in the coming decade; in particular, Lithium-ion batteries for the automotive industry is expected to continue to drive demand beyond supply.
 
Recently, Japan and South Korea have both recorded high levels of Lithium-ion battery exports as auto companies’ ramp up battery consumption to power all-electric vehicle sales. China has the most electric vehicles on the road, but both European and North American auto manufacturers are committed to significantly increasing EV sales by 2025. In November 2019, Ford unveiled its long awaited fully electric Mustang-styled SUV.
 
Goldman Sachs predicted that the market consumption could very well triple from the current production by 2025. Just a 1% increase of Electric Vehicles hitting the market could increase lithium demand by roughly half of the current production of lithium today.
 
SQM’s CEO Patricio de Solminihac said in a 2018 interview with Reuters that the company would invest $525 million in order to expand its lithium production in Chile through 2021, due to the high demand for electric vehicle batteries. FMC and Albemarle have decided not to wait either. FMC announced in May 2017 it would triple its production of lithium hydroxide by 2019, increasing to 30,000 tons from 10,000. Albemarle also announced it would be increasing production of lithium carbonate to 70,000 tons from 24,000 over a few years.
 
Tesla’s mile long Gigafactory started producing powerful Lithium-ion batteries in January 2017 with its partner Panasonic. The Gigafactory will supply batteries for the 500,000 cars Tesla hopes to produce by the end of the decade, as well as to power homes. Also, Chrysler, Dodge, Ford, GM, BMW, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Saturn, Tesla and Toyota have all announced plans to build lithium-ion battery powered cars. After Tesla released the Model 3 in July 2017, there have been over 500,000 reservations for the vehicle and production is starting 2 years ahead of schedule. Elon Musk has stated that Tesla will have to acquire the entire lithium market to meet the current demands. Thus, the global lithium market is approaching shortages, which has made it a useful commodity and mineral explorers have launched efforts to locate and bring new suppliers to the marketplace.
 
Lithium brine exploration and development has proven to be much more cost effective and faster to be put into production than the hard rock mine counterparts. Lithium brine deposits are considered placer deposits and are easier to gain mining permits for. Brine is also a liquid which means that drilling to find it is more akin to drilling for water or oil. It’s also typically located relatively close to surface, which limits the depth of required drilling. Once a Lithium Brine is found, the reserve data is more straightforward to understand and quantify.
 
As the brines are found in large flat areas, the construction of numerous flat evaporation pools or direct solvent extraction can be achieved at relatively low cost. Environmental impact is minimized as the excess residual brines can be pumped back into the salt flats.

In Summary:
 
Historically, lithium demand came from industrial sectors manufacturing greases, glass, and ceramics. The processing of lithium for industrial applications requires lower specification products. 
 
The introduction of the lithium-ion battery for consumer electronics, EV, and energy storage applications changed the demand dynamic; the batteries for e-mobility and energy storage now dominate current and future demand for lithium. Electric vehicles will continue to require vast amounts of lithium with higher grade and purities.
 
Electric Vehicle OEM are increasingly quality-conscious, and develop close relationships to the modern “megafactories” that supply them with battery cells. In order to consistently supply the desired high nickel cathodes, megafactories need high purity raw materials - particularly lithium - to create low impurity lithium hydroxide.
 
In the United States, there are not currently enough chemical producers in operation to meet existing or future standards; battery grade hydroxide production is quite small as compared to the whole lithium supply chain. To meet market demand, this segment must quickly grow in the short term, at an estimated rate of 35-40% between now and 2025.
 
In 2019, explanations for the drop in the price of lithium were erroneously attributed to the “oversupply myth.” The reality is that there is not “too much lithium” in production but rather that there is not enough battery grade lithium hydroxide to meet market demand to fuel the explosive projections for Electric Vehicles.
 
Existing producers know that aside from handling and limited shelf life, consistently producing battery grade hydroxide within "spec,” while meeting the qualification challenges going forward will require significantly more high-grade lithium products. This will require new resources of raw materials, which demands investment in new exploration and mining projects.
 
Competition
 
We compete with other mining/exploration and battery recycling companies, many of which possess greater financial resources and technical facilities than we do, in connection with the acquisition of suitable exploration properties, building and operating process plants and in connection with the engagement of qualified personnel. The lithium exploration/mining and battery recycling industries are fragmented, and we are a very small participant in these sectors. Many of our competitors have been in business longer than we have and have established more strategic partnerships and relationships and have greater financial accessibility than we have.
 
While we compete with other exploration companies in acquiring suitable properties, we believe that there would be readily available purchasers of lithium and other precious metals if they were to be produced from any of our leased properties. The price of precious metals can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including:
 

fluctuations in the market prices for lithium; 
 
fluctuating supplies of lithium; 
 
fluctuating demand for lithium; and 
 
mining activities of others. 
 
If lithium mineralization that is determined to be of economic grade and in sufficient quantity to justify production were located, additional capital would be required to develop, mine and sell our production.
