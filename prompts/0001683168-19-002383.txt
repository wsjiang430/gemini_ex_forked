Item 1. Description of Business
 
Forward-looking statements
 
Statements made in this Form 10-K that are not historical or current facts are "forward-looking statements" made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
 
Financial information contained in this report and in our financial statements is stated in United States dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
 
Corporate Overview
 
Yijia Group Corp. (formerly, Soldino Group Corp.) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 25, 2017 and established a fiscal year end of April 30. We are a development-stage company formed to commence operations in the distribution and sewing of work wear. We recently ceased and discontinued our operations. As such, we accounted for all of its assets, liabilities and results of operations up to October 31, 2018 as discontinued operations.
 
We do not have any subsidiaries.
 
We never have declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or involved in any kind of legal proceedings.
 
Going Concern
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company currently has no operations and as of April 30, 2019 had a stockholders deficit of $50,242. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Companyâ€™s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Business
 
Currently, we have no active operations.
 
Research and Development
 
We have not incurred any research and development costs in the fiscal years ended April 30, 2018 or 2019.
 
Insurance
 
We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party to any action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.

Government Regulation
 
We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to export and import of work wear and operation of any facility in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business. We do not need to receive any government approvals necessary to conduct our business; however, we will have to comply with all applicable export and import regulations.
