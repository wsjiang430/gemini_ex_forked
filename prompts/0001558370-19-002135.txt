 Item 1. Business
     Overview 
     We are a medical technology company focused on the design, development and commercialization of glucose monitoring products to improve the lives of people with diabetes by enhancing their ability to manage their disease with relative ease and accuracy. Our continuous glucose monitoring, or CGM, systems, Eversense and Eversense XL, are reliable, long-term, implantable CGM systems that we have designed to continually and accurately measure glucose levels in people with diabetes for a period of up to 90 and 180 days, respectively, as compared to six to fourteen days for currently available CGM systems. We believe Eversense and Eversense XL will provide people with diabetes with a more convenient method to monitor their glucose levels in comparison to the traditional method of self-monitoring of blood glucose, or SMBG, as well as currently available CGM systems. In our U.S. pivotal clinical trial, we observed that Eversense measured glucose levels over 90 days with a degree of accuracy superior to that of other currently available CGM systems. On June 21, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved our Eversense system for marketing in the United States and we began distributing Eversense in the United States through our direct sales force and a network of strategic fulfillment partners in July 2018. Eversense received a CE mark in June 2016, which marked the first approval for the product to be sold within the European Economic Area. Eversense and Eversense XL are currently available in select markets in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA).
     Diabetes is a chronic, life-threatening disease for which there is no known cure. The disease is caused by the body's inability to produce or effectively utilize the hormone insulin, which prevents the body from adequately regulating blood glucose levels. If diabetes is not managed properly, it can lead to serious health conditions and complications, including heart disease, limb amputations, loss of kidney function, blindness, seizures, coma and even death. According to the 2017 International Diabetes Federation, or IDF, Atlas, an estimated 425 million people worldwide had diabetes as of the date of the report. The number of people with diabetes worldwide is estimated to grow to 629 million by 2045, driven primarily by growth in type 2 diabetes and due to various reasons, including changes in dietary trends, an aging population and increased prevalence of the disease in younger people. Diabetes is typically classified into two primary types. type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder that usually develops during childhood and is characterized by the inability of the body to produce insulin, resulting from destruction of the insulin producing beta cells of the pancreas. type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder that results when the body is unable to produce sufficient amounts of insulin or becomes insulin resistant. People with type 1 diabetes must administer insulin, either by injection or insulin pump, to survive. People with type 2 diabetes may require diet and nutrition management, exercise, oral medications or the administration of insulin to regulate blood glucose levels. In the next few years, we expect the growth in sales of CGM systems to be driven primarily by increased penetration of CGM in the type 1 patient population.
     In an attempt to maintain blood glucose levels within the normal range, many people with diabetes seek to actively monitor their blood glucose levels. The traditional SMBG method of glucose monitoring requires lancing the fingertips, commonly referred to as fingersticks, multiple times per day and night to obtain a blood drop to be applied to a test strip inside a blood glucose meter. This method of monitoring glucose levels is inconvenient and can be painful and, because each measurement represents a single blood glucose value at a single point in time, it provides limited information regarding trends in blood glucose levels. In contrast, CGM systems are generally less painful and involve the insertion of sensors into the body to measure glucose levels in the interstitial fluid throughout the day and night, providing real-time data that shows trends in glucose measurements. Since CGM measurements from interstitial tissue are inherently less accurate than test-strip measurements made directly from the blood, the FDA and other device regulators historically have required that CGMs be labeled and marketed as "adjunctive" to test-strip measurements, with instructions that patients confirm CGM measurements with test-strip measurements using blood obtained from fingersticks prior to self-medicating. Recent improvements in the accuracy of CGM systems have led to the FDA issuing the first “non-adjunctive” label in 2016. The approval of the Eversense pre-market application, or PMA, was issued with an “adjunctive” label. We have filed a PMA supplement seeking approval for a “non-adjunctive” label. We also recently received approval in the United States and Europe to expand the Eversense certification to nurse practitioners and physician assistants, expanding the number of professionals who can perform Eversense insertions.

 We have designed Eversense and Eversense XL to continually and accurately measure glucose levels under the skin for up to 90 and 180 days, respectively, as compared to six to fourteen days for currently available CGM systems. Eversense also includes additional safety features that warn the user before the occurrence of adverse events and provide distinct on-body vibrations in a number of situations, such as when low or high glucose levels are reached. We believe that Eversense provides a more convenient method of continuous glucose monitoring by providing longer duration, equal or superior accuracy, state of the art communications and analytical capabilities, on-body alarms and alerts and the convenience of being able to take the transmitter on and off with no loss of the sensor. 
     According to the National Diabetes Statistics Report, as of the end of 2015, there are approximately 23 million patients diagnosed with diabetes in the United States. We estimate that 6.9 million of these diabetes patients take insulin.
     We are headquartered in Germantown, Maryland. The members of our management team have held senior leadership positions at a number of medical technology and biopharmaceutical companies, including Abbott Diabetes Care, TheraSense, and Medtronic.
     Members of our team have contributed to the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of several glucose monitoring systems and insulin pumps. 
     Clinical Development and Regulatory Pathway 
     Overview 
     In support of our regulatory submissions, we have expended considerable resources designing, developing and refining a glucose monitoring system. We have completed both our European and U.S. pivotal trials. The Eversense and Eversense XL systems have received a CE mark in Europe and are currently being sold commercially. Our PRECISE II U.S. pivotal trial was completed during 2016 and we received PMA approval from the FDA for the Eversense system on June 21, 2018. 
     We have initiated a clinical trial in the United States for the purpose of submitting a PMA supplement to the FDA for Eversense XL, an extended version of the Eversense system extending its use for a period of up to 180 days. We are also continuing to conduct a number of feasibility studies in which we are evaluating various configurations of our CGM system. These studies are intended to assess the performance of different system configurations in a small population of subjects before enrolling a large clinical trial. 
     United States Pivotal Trials 
     In 2016, we conducted our U.S. 90-day pivotal trial. The trial was a prospective, single-arm, multi-center trial designed to determine the accuracy and safety of the Eversense system. Ninety subjects were enrolled in eight centers across the United States. Eighty-seven of the ninety enrollees completed the 90-day trial. 
     The clinical trial population consisted of subjects at least 18 years of age who had a clinically confirmed diagnosis of diabetes. Subjects who had a history of severe hypoglycemia, defined as hypoglycemia resulting in loss of consciousness or seizure, or diabetic ketoacidosis, in the six months prior to the trial, were excluded from participation in the clinical trial. Accuracy measurements were taken at 1 day, 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days post-insertion. These sensor measurements were continued through the earlier of the failure of the sensor or 90 days post-insertion.
     The purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate the accuracy of Eversense measurements, measured by the MARD, when compared with bed-side blood glucose measurements obtained using the YSI glucose analyzer over successive periods of 30 days through 90 days, as well as to assess the safety of Eversense. YSI in vitro analyzers are bed-side instruments used in hospitals and clinics to accurately measure blood glucose levels and are commonly used as comparators of glucose monitoring systems in clinical trials. MARD is a statistical calculation that measures the average absolute value of the differences, expressed as a percentage, between glucose measurements taken from interstitial fluid based on our CGM system and blood glucose measurements from YSI. The lower the MARD of a glucose monitoring system, the more accurate the system and, therefore, the more reliable the system's readings.

     During the trial, 75 subjects underwent unilateral sensor insertions and 15 subjects underwent bilateral sensor insertions in the clinic and used Eversense’s smart transmitter and mobile app at home for the next 90 days. Subjects were blinded to the real-time glucose readings and trends during home-use and sensor readings were not used to adjust their treatment. Clinic visits were scheduled at approximately 30-day intervals in order to obtain lab reference glucose values for comparison with the sensor values and to evaluate hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic challenges in a controlled setting.
     In the trial, we observed a mean absolute relative difference, or MARD, of 8.4% for Eversense across the 40-400 mg/dL range when compared to YSI blood reference values during the 90-day continuous wear period. Based on the data from this trial, we submitted a PMA application to the FDA to market Eversense in the United States for 90-day use. On June 21, 2018, we received PMA approval from the FDA for the Eversense system. We have begun distributing the Eversense system directly in the United States through our own direct sales and marketing organization. We have received Category III CPT codes for the insertion and removal of the Eversense sensor and intend to pursue a Category I CPT code in the future.
     In December 2018, we began enrollment for the U.S. 180-day pivotal trial. The trial is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center trial designed to evaluate the accuracy and safety of the Eversense system up to 180 days using the methods described above for the 90-day system. Approximately 180 subjects will be enrolled in up to 15 centers across the United States. We expect that enrollment will be completed in the third quarter of 2019 and we expect to report data through 180 days in the first half of 2020. The clinical trial population will consist of subjects at least 18 years of age who have had a clinically confirmed diagnosis of diabetes for at least one year. Subjects with a history of unexplained severe hypoglycemia, defined as hypoglycemia resulting in loss of consciousness or seizure, or diabetic ketoacidosis, in the six months prior to the trial are excluded from participation in the clinical trial. After screening, sensor(s) will be inserted and accuracy measurements will be taken at multiple visits during the first 30 days and then every 30 days to 180 days post-insertion or until sensor failure, if earlier than 180 days post-insertion.
     Our Technology
     Eversense consists of three primary components: a small sensor inserted subcutaneously under the skin by a healthcare provider; an external removable smart transmitter that receives, assesses and relays data from the sensor and provides vibratory alerts; and a mobile app that receives data from the transmitter and provides real-time glucose readings, alerts and other data on the person's mobile device. All of these components work together to provide sensor glucose values, trends and alerts to a user's mobile device within 20 milliseconds. We have designed this reliable, long-term and implantable CGM system to continually and accurately measure a person's glucose levels for up to 180 days. Eversense requires twice daily fingerstick calibrations. Further, upon receiving an alert from the CGM, a patient should confirm CGM measurements with test-strip measurements prior to self-medicating, as noted in the CGM's label and instructions.

 Sensor 
     The sensor is designed to be inserted under the skin, either in the back of the upper arm or in the abdomen, and measures the glucose in the interstitial fluid. These glucose levels are then communicated wirelessly to the smart transmitter. We have designed the sensor to last up to 180 days (approved for 90 days in the U.S.), as compared to other currently available CGM sensors labeled for use for between six and fourteen days.
     The sensor consists of an optical system, known as a micro-fluorometer, encased in a rigid, translucent polymer capsule, which is 3.3 mm in diameter and 15 mm in length. The capsule is coated with a glucose-indicating hydrogel that is bound to the surface of the capsule through polymerization. This hydrogel is energized, or excited, by a light-emitting diode, or LED, contained in the optical system of the sensor, causing the hydrogel to fluoresce, or glow. Two photodiodes within the optical system of the sensor measure the degree of fluorescence of the hydrogel, which is proportional to the level of glucose present in the interstitial fluid. The sensor then communicates the amount of fluorescence via a near field communication, or NFC, interface to the transmitter. NFC is a high frequency wireless communication technology that enables the exchange of data and energy between devices over a short range. The entire capsule is coated by a glucose-permeable membrane for biocompatibility.
     The sensor does not use a battery or other stored power source. Instead, it is remotely and discretely powered, as needed, by an inductive NFC link between the sensor and the transmitter. On power-up, the LED source is energized for approximately five milliseconds to excite the hydrogel. Between readings every five minutes, the sensor remains electrically dormant and fully powered down. 
     Smart Transmitter 
     The removable smart transmitter is a rechargeable, external device that is worn over the sensor implantation site using a daily adhesive patch or band, such as an armband or waistband. The transmitter supplies wireless power to the sensor through an inductive NFC link, which activates a measurement sequence every five minutes. The transmitter then receives data from the sensor and calculates glucose concentrations and trends. Based on these calculations and on the user's individual settings for glucose levels, the transmitter determines if an alert condition exists, in which case the transmitter communicates the condition to the user through on-body vibration. The information from the transmitter is also transmitted for display to the user's mobile device via Low-Energy Bluetooth, or BLE. Our transmitter is functional for at least 36 hours without recharging and can be fully charged in fifteen minutes.      Mobile App 
     Our mobile app is a software application that runs on both iOS mobile devices, including iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches, and Android mobile devices. The mobile app receives information from the transmitter via BLE and displays that information discreetly to the user. This user-friendly, intuitive app provides real-time glucose readings, trends, graphs and alarms. Within the mobile app, users can set alarms based on, among other things, glucose levels. The mobile app also allows for cloud-based storage.      Future Product Development 
     Following the potential approval of Eversense XL in the United States, we intend to continue to expand our line of product offerings to benefit both people with diabetes and healthcare providers. We expect these product development initiatives to include system modifications and next generation enhancements that we believe will further increase the convenience and appeal of our products to people with diabetes and healthcare providers. 
     Future developments include the submission of a PMA-supplement application for a “non-adjunctive” dosing claim, which would permit users to dose with insulin without first confirming the blood glucose measure via a fingerstick, submitting an IDE for a pediatric trial in the United States, submitting a PMA-supplement application for a one calibration per day calibration scheme following the review of our PMA-supplement application for the “non-adjunctive” dosing claim, potential further reductions of significantly reducing calibration requirements, continuing to improve accuracy, and initiating clinical trials for On-Demand, or “swipe”, and technology for both type 1 and type 2

users. Through our collaboration with Roche, and separately with BetaBionics, we are working on a closed loop diabetes management system that would allow users to automatically and sustainably maintain tight glucose control while avoiding hypoglycemia.
     Sales and Marketing 
     We are utilizing third-party distributors for our commercial activities in Europe. We currently market Eversense in 15 European countries where there is an understanding and market acceptance of CGM. We have an exclusive arrangement with Rubin Medical for sales in Scandinavia. We have an exclusive arrangement with Roche Diabetes Care for sales in the rest of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, excluding Israel and Finland, and in 17 additional countries, including Brazil, Russia, India, and China, as well as select markets in the Asia Pacific and Latin American regions.
     Based on the size and maturity of the U.S. market, we are investing in developing a direct sales team consisting regional and district managers, medical educators, and a customer care organization to support the continued commercialization of the product in the United States in order to target what we estimate to be approximately 2,100 endocrinologists in the United States who are clinically active and diabetes-focused. We utilize a network of strategic fulfillment partners in the United States who resell the products to health care providers and patients. 
    
We recently announced that we would be launching a patient access program, the Eversense Bridge Program, in March 2019 to assist those patients who do not have insurance coverage for Eversense, or whose insurance is denied or insufficient. Pursuant to this program, we will provide financial assistance to eligible patients purchasing Eversense, which may be substantial depending on a patient’s insurance coverage. The program establishes maximum limits per patient in the program and excludes certain patients as ineligible, including government-insured patients and residents of certain states. We believe this patient access program will enable more patients to utilize the Eversense system.
     As people with diabetes often consult with their healthcare providers about treatment options, we believe that educating healthcare providers regarding the benefits of Eversense compared to SMBG and other currently available CGM systems is an important step in promoting its use in people with diabetes. Our European experience and our initial feedback in the United States indicates healthcare providers highly valued the accuracy and sensor duration of our system and the majority of physicians surveyed considered the insertion process to be fairly simple or feasible. We intend to continue educating healthcare providers and people with diabetes on the advantages of Eversense compared to SMBG and other currently available CGM systems. 
     Distribution Agreement with Rubin Medical 
                   In September 2015, we entered into a distribution agreement with Rubin Medical, or Rubin, pursuant to which we granted Rubin the exclusive right to market, sell and distribute Eversense in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Pursuant to the agreement, Rubin is obligated to purchase from us specified minimum volumes of Eversense components at pre-determined prices, which are subject to potential amendment upon the occurrence of specified events. Rubin is responsible for the promotion, sale and distribution of Eversense in Sweden, Norway and Denmark at such prices as Rubin determines in its sole discretion, subject to specified exceptions. 
                   The distribution agreement has an initial term of five years and is subject to renewal for up to two additional five year periods if, at least 180 days prior to the expiration of a term, we and Rubin agree to minimum purchase requirements for the additional term and we do not increase the purchase price of Eversense components that are subject to existing publicly procured contracts unless Rubin can pass through the price increase to the customer. 
                   The distribution agreement is terminable by us upon 30 days' notice under a number of circumstances, including if Rubin fails to make required payments, Rubin competes with us or Rubin seeks to distribute Eversense outside of Sweden, Norway or Denmark. The agreement is terminable by Rubin upon 30 days' notice under a number of circumstances, including if we breach the warranties of the agreement, fail to obtain marketing approval or fail to satisfy our supply obligations. The agreement is terminable by either party if the other party fails to comply with marketing laws, violates the confidentiality or intellectual property protection provisions of the agreement, becomes insolvent, or becomes subject to specified convictions, injections or enforcement actions. The termination rights contained in the

agreement generally are subject to an opportunity to cure. Further, we may terminate the agreement upon a change of control of our company, subject to us providing 180 days’ written notice and paying a specified termination fee to Rubin.
     Distribution Agreement with Roche Diabetes Care
     On May 24, 2016, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Roche Diagnostics International AG, Basel Branch Diabetes Care, and Roche Diabetes Care GmbH, or collectively, Roche, pursuant to which we granted Roche the exclusive right to market, sell and distribute Eversense in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. On November 28, 2016, we amended the distribution agreement to also grant Roche the exclusive right to market, sell and distribute Eversense in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, excluding Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Israel. 
     On January 31, 2019, we further amended the distribution agreement. As amended, the distribution agreement has a term through January 31, 2021. Under the terms of the extended agreement, Roche will continue its role as our exclusive distributor in EMEA excluding Scandinavia and Israel. In addition, under the extended agreement, Roche has exclusive distribution rights in 17 additional countries, including Brazil, Russia, India and China, as well as select markets in the Asia Pacific and Latin American regions. Roche is obligated to purchase from us specified minimum volumes of Eversense components at pre-determined prices.
     The distribution agreement, as amended, is terminable by us under a number of circumstances, including if Roche materially breaches the terms of the agreement or fails to make certain minimum sales requirements. The agreement is terminable by Roche under a number of circumstances, including if we materially breach the agreement, if the distribution of Eversense is enjoined in the covered territories or in the case of certain intellectual property infringement claims. The agreement is terminable by either party if the other party becomes insolvent or subject to bankruptcy proceedings. The termination rights contained in the agreement are generally subject to advance notice requirements and an opportunity to cure. Further, Roche may terminate the agreement upon a change of control of our company with a transition period of the shorter of 18 months or the remaining term of the agreement.        Reimbursement 
     Coverage in the United States 
     In the U.S. market, it is critical to maintain third-party payor coverage policies, coding mechanisms, and adequate payment for medical technology to obtain market acceptance and adoption. CGM as a class of products has been broadly accepted by commercial third-party payors, such as health insurers and health maintenance organizations, and more recently by Medicare for patients who require the use of insulin to manage their diabetes. Given Eversense currently does not possess a “therapeutic label,” Medicare coverage is not available. Moreover, it is unclear how the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, will allow for access to Eversense at the Medicare Administrative Contractor level since it is supported by a Category III CPT code and a procedure-based technology. At present, the dominant target market for CGM resides in the commercial sector. While obtaining Medicare coverage in the future is important, gaining coverage with, and adequate reimbursement from, U.S. commercial third-party payors is paramount to gaining and maintaining market adoption of Eversense.
     Currently, we have approached large national U.S. commercial third-party payors, as well as regional commercial payors, in an effort to establish coverage for Eversense. To date, we have received positive reimbursement decisions from U.S. third-party payors that cover approximately 60 million people in the United States. We have been met with mixed results seeing some commercial payors establishing a clear coverage position for Eversense and the CPT codes that support it. However, other commercial payors have either remained silent or have denied coverage by explicitly deeming Eversense as an “experimental and investigational” technology. Our experience shows us that policy silence notwithstanding, Eversense is being paid for consistently through the existing HCPCS codes for CGM technology. Additionally, we have experienced payment for Eversense through various Pharmacy Benefit Managers as Eversense maintains “NDC codes” that allow for pharmacy adjudication to take place.  
     For the established Category III CPT procedure codes we have also observed mixed results where some commercial third-party payors have set payment in their claims system for these unique codes, while other commercial 

 
  9

 
payors have not set standard payment in their systems, thus requiring claims re-submission by the HCP’s staff. As commercial third-party payors gain more experience with claims that are being submitted for the Eversense procedure, we are confident that over time, the existing code will be accepted and paid for more consistently through the patient’s health plan benefit. Until payment for the Eversense sensor placement becomes consistent, some patients will be required to bear the financial cost for the placement of the sensor by their HCP. As a result some patients and their HCPs may choose not to use Eversense on a widespread basis. We intend to seek a Category I CPT code for the placement of Eversense in the future, but the timing of filing the Category I CPT code is contingent on product iteration and other factors in the reimbursement environment.
     Where commercial payors have determined that Eversense is “experimental and investigational,” we believe the reasoning of many of these payors largely rests on their view that additional larger, randomized, well controlled clinical trials are needed to demonstrate the impact of Eversense on health outcomes. We disagree with this position as the CGM class has already proven to improve health outcomes and Eversense is another product that fits into the class. We do not believe running a redundant clinical trial materially adds to the body of evidence supporting CGM. Additionally, some commercial third-party payors believe that the nature of implantation adds to the overall CGM cost, which we believe is incorrect based on our budget impact models and how we have priced Eversense in the U.S. market. We believe as the market gets more experience with Eversense and the deeper understanding of its overall price profile, more U.S. commercial third-party payors will provide coverage. However, the reimbursement market is still focused on containing healthcare costs and lack of visibility into the exact impacts may stall commercial third-party payor adoption until that understanding is realized. Accordingly, unless CMS and other third-party payors provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for Eversense and the related insertion and removal procedures, market adoption and our financial performance may be limited.
     Coverage Outside the United States 
     In countries outside the United States, coverage for CGM systems is obtained from various sources, including governmental authorities, national healthcare systems, private health insurance plans, and hospital funds. Coverage systems in international markets vary significantly by country and, within some countries, by region. Coverage approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country, region-by-region or, in some instances, a case-by case basis. The responsibility for securing this coverage resides with our third-party distributors in the respective markets.       Manufacturing and Quality Assurance 
     We currently outsource the manufacturing of all components of our system. We plan to continue with an outsourced manufacturing arrangement for the foreseeable future. Our contract manufacturers are all recognized in their field for their competency to manufacture the respective portions of our system and have quality systems established that meet FDA and, to the extent required, international regulatory requirements. We believe the manufacturers we currently utilize have sufficient capacity to meet our requirements and are able to scale up their capacity relatively quickly with minimal capital investment. We believe that, as we increase our demand in the future, our per unit costs will decrease materially.
     We have received certification from BSI, our Notified Body to the International Standards Organization, or ISO, for our quality system. This ISO 13485:2016 certification includes design control requirements. As a medical device manufacturer, the facilities of our sterilization and other critical suppliers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies. We believe that our quality systems and those of our suppliers are robust and achieve high product quality.
     Our suppliers are managed through our supplier management program that is focused on reducing supply chain risk. Key aspects of this program include managing component inventory at the supplier, contractual requirements for last time buy opportunities and second sourcing approaches for specific suppliers. Typically, our outside vendors produce the components to our specifications and in many instances to our designs. Our suppliers are audited periodically by our quality department to ensure conformity with the specifications, policies and procedures for our devices. We believe that, if necessary, alternative sources of supply would be available in a relatively short period of time and on commercially reasonable terms.

     Competition 
     The market for CGM systems is developing and competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions. We expect to compete with well-capitalized companies, some of which are publicly-traded, that manufacture CGM systems including Dexcom, Medtronic and Abbott. Each of these companies has received approval from the FDA to market their respective CGM system. Dexcom's Bluetooth-enabled CGM system is designed to be integrated with smartphones. Dexcom’s CGM system was the first CGM system to be approved by the FDA for marketing as a non-adjunctive device, and Abbott’s Freestyle Libre was also approved for non-adjunctive use. Both Dexcom (G6) and Abbott (Freestyle Libre) systems have factory calibration, and do not require user calibration.
     As the industry evolves, we anticipate encountering increasing competition from companies that integrate CGM with insulin pumps. We are aware of two companies, Medtronic and Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc., which have received FDA approval for CGM-integrated insulin pumps.
     In addition to CGM providers, we will also compete with providers of traditional SMBG systems. Three companies currently account for a substantial share of the worldwide sales of SMBG systems: Roche Diabetes Care, a division of Roche Diagnostics; Abbott; and Ascensia Diabetes Care Holdings AG.
     We may also compete with companies, including Abbott, developing next generation real-time CGM or sensing devices and technologies, as well as several other companies that are evaluating non-invasive CGM products to measure a user's blood glucose level. For example, Abbott has commercialized its FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System, which eliminates the need for routine fingersticks by reading glucose levels through a transcutaneous sensor that can be worn for up to 14 days in the United States and Europe. There are also a number of academic and other institutions involved in various phases of our industry's technology development.
     Although we will face potential competition from many different sources, we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources will provide us with competitive advantages. The key competitive factors affecting the success of Eversense are likely to be: the accuracy, sensor duration, safety, convenience, adherence and price of treatment; the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors; effective sales, marketing and distribution; brand awareness and acceptance by healthcare providers and people with diabetes; customer service and support and comprehensive education for people with diabetes and their healthcare providers; and rapid product innovation, including insulin pump integration.
     Many of the companies against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or earlier stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our development. 
     Intellectual Property 
     Protection of our intellectual property is a strategic priority for our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets as well as nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements, material transfer agreements, confidentiality agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.

 Patents 
     As of December 31, 2018, we held a total of approximately 503 issued patents and pending patent applications that relate to our CGM system. Our intellectual property portfolio includes 51 issued United States patents, 226 patents issued in countries outside the United States and 226 pending patent applications worldwide. Our patents expire between 2019 and 2036, subject to any patent extensions that may be available for such patents. If patents are issued on our pending patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2020 to 2039. 
     Our patents and patent applications cover certain aspects of our core sensor technologies and our product concepts for CGM systems. However, our patent applications may not result in issued patents, and any patents that have been issued or may be issued in the future may not protect the commercially important aspects of our technology. Furthermore, the validity and enforceability of our issued patents may be challenged by third parties and our patents could be invalidated or modified by the issuing governmental authority. Third parties may independently develop technology that is not covered by our patents that is similar to or competes with our technology. In addition, our intellectual property may be infringed or misappropriated by third parties, particularly in foreign countries where the laws and governmental authorities may not protect our proprietary rights as effectively as those in the United States.
     The medical device industry in general, and the glucose testing sector of this industry in particular, are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on assertions of patent infringement. We are aware of numerous patents issued to third parties that may relate to the technology used in our business, including the design and manufacture of CGM sensors and CGM systems, as well as methods for continuous glucose monitoring. Each of these patents contains multiple claims, any one of which may be independently asserted against us. The owners of these patents may assert that the manufacture, use, sale or offer for sale of our CGM sensors or CGM systems infringes one or more claims of their patents. Furthermore, there may be additional patents issued to third parties of which we are presently unaware that may relate to aspects of our technology that such third parties could assert against us and materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be patent applications that are currently pending and unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that third parties could assert against us and materially and adversely affect our business.
     Any adverse determination in litigations, post grant trial proceedings, including interference proceedings, at the Patent Office relating to intellectual property to which we are or may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties, and result in the cancellation and/or invalidation of our intellectual property. Furthermore, if a court finds that we have willfully infringed a third party's intellectual property, we could be required to pay treble damages and/or attorney fees for the prevailing party, in addition to other penalties. Although intellectual property disputes in the medical device area are often settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with such arrangements can be substantial and often require ongoing royalty payments. We may be unable to obtain necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. If we do not obtain necessary licenses, we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement; if we are able to redesign our products to avoid infringement, we may not receive FDA approval in a timely manner. Adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products, which could have a significant adverse impact on our business. 
     Trademarks 
     We have no pending U.S. trademark applications and 29 pending foreign trademark applications, as well as 14 U.S. trademark registrations and 65 foreign trademark registrations. 
     Trade Secrets 
     We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect such intellectual property and proprietary information by generally requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement as the case may be. Our agreements with our employees prohibit them from providing us with any intellectual property or proprietary 

 
  12

 
information of third parties. We also generally require confidentiality agreements or material transfer agreements with third parties that receive or have access to our confidential information, data or other materials. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that our employees and third parties that have access to our confidential proprietary information will abide by the terms of their agreements. Despite the measures that we take to protect our intellectual property and confidential information, unauthorized third parties may copy aspects of our products or obtain and use our proprietary information. 
     Government Regulation 
     Eversense is a medical device subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA, CMS, the European Commission, and regulatory bodies in other countries. Regulations cover virtually every critical aspect of a medical device company's business operations, including research activities, product development, contracting, reimbursement, medical communications, and sales and marketing. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the implementing regulations of the FDA govern product design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, product manufacturing, import and export, product labeling, product storage, recalls and field safety corrective actions, advertising and promotion, product sales and distribution, and post-market clinical surveillance. Our business is subject to federal, state, local, and foreign regulations, such as ISO 13485, ISO 14971, FDA's Quality System Regulation, or QSR, contained in 21 CFR Part 820, and Directive 90/385/EEC concerning active implantable medical devices, as amended. 
     Regulation by the FDA 
     The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices are subject to general controls such as labeling, pre-market notification and adherence to the FDA's QSR, which cover manufacturers' methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of products, but are usually exempt from premarket notification requirements. Class II devices are subject to the same general controls, may be subject to special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, FDA guidelines, or particularized labeling, and may also require clinical testing prior to clearance or approval. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls, including devices that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury.
     Some Class I and Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the pre-market notification requirement under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, and the requirement of compliance with substantially all of the QSR. However, a PMA application is required for devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or certain implantable devices, or those that are "not substantially equivalent" either to a device previously cleared through the 510(k) process or to a "preamendment" Class III device in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 when PMA applications were not required. Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified CGM system we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either 510(k) clearance or approval from the FDA through the PMA process. 
     A PMA application must be supported by valid scientific evidence that typically includes extensive technical, preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA's satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device. A PMA application also must include a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling. After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information.
    
During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA. 
    
 
  13

 

 The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
    
· | the device may not be safe, effective, reliable or accurate to the FDA's satisfaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
     International Regulation 
     International sales of medical devices are subject to local government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval in another country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union, United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries.
     The European Union, or EU, has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the EU with respect to medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives, or Essential Requirements, and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the EU. To assist manufacturers in satisfying the Essential Requirements, the European standards organizations have prepared European standards applicable to medical devices. These include harmonized international quality standards aimed at ensuring that medical devices are correctly designed and manufactured.. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third party assessment by a "Notified Body." Notified Bodies are entities licensed (‘notified’) by the individual European member states to provide independent certification of certain classes of medical device. They apply for and are designated to carry out this function by the relevant national competent authorities, which carry out periodic assessment audits to determine whether the Notified Bodies continue to satisfy the necessary requirements. A conformity assessment conducted by a Notified Body may consist of an audit of the medical device manufacturer's quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer's product to ensure that the medical device complies with the Essential Requirements. Once the appropriate conformity assessment procedure has been completed, the manufacturer must draw up a written declaration of conformity and affix the CE mark to the device. The device can then be marketed throughout the European Economic Area (being the EU, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) or EEA. Notified Bodies perform surveillance and unannounced audits at the manufacturer and critical suppliers with respect to the devices covered by the certificates issued by them. If non-conformities raised during the audits are not timely remedied by the manufacturer, the Notified Body may (partially or wholly) suspend or withdraw the certificate concerned. Additional local requirements may apply on a country-by-country basis. Outside of the European Union, regulatory approval would need to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order for us to market our products.
     Other Regulatory Requirements 
     Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:
    
· | establishment registration and device listing;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  14

 


· | MDR regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | voluntary and mandatory device recalls to address problems when a device is defective and could be a risk to health; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | corrections and removals reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Also, the FDA requires us to conduct Post Approval Studies (post-market surveillance studies) and establish and maintain a system for tracking our products through the chain of distribution to the patient level. The FDA and applicable regulatory agencies enforce regulatory requirements by conducting periodic, unannounced inspections and market surveillance. Inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. 
     Moreover, the FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of medical products. Medical products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved medical products for unapproved indications. Companies may also share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
     In the United States, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. These may include any of the following sanctions or consequences:
    
· | warning letters or untitled letters that require corrective action;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines and civil penalties;
--+---------------------------


· | unanticipated expenditures;
--+----------------------------


· | delays in approving or refusal to approve future products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | suspension or withdrawal of FDA clearance or approval;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | product recall or seizure;
--+---------------------------


· | interruption of production;
--+----------------------------


· | operating restrictions;
--+------------------------


· | injunctions; and
--+-----------------


· | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

      In the European Union, member states are responsible for enforcing the EU’s medical device rules and for ensuring that only compliant medical devices are placed on the market or put into service in their jurisdictions. They have powers to suspend the marketing and use, or demand the recall, of unsafe or non-compliant devices. They also have the power to bring enforcement action against companies or individuals for breaches of the device rules. Non-compliance may also result in Notified Bodies revoking any certificate of conformity that they have issued for a device or the manufacturer’s quality system.
     Our contract manufacturers, specification developers and some suppliers of components or device accessories, also are required to manufacture our products in compliance with current good manufacturing practice requirements set forth in the QSR. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and it includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components or services, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA evaluates compliance with the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. If the FDA believes that any of our 

 
  15

 
contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers are not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down such manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees. 
     Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and Similar Foreign and State Laws and Regulations Affecting the Transmission, Security and Privacy of Health Information 
     We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as service providers of covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Accordingly, state attorneys general (along with private plaintiffs) have brought civil actions seeking injunctions and damages resulting from alleged violations of HIPAA’s privacy and security rules. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from HIPAA and each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect.
     In the European Union (and, specifically the European Economic Area) (EU/EEA), the General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679), or GDPR, went into effect on May 25, 2018 and replaced Directive 95/46/EC (the EU Privacy Directive). The GDPR applies to personal data about identified or identifiable data subjects processed by automated means and data contained in, or intended to be part of, non-automated filing systems (traditional paper files) as well as transfer of such data to a country outside of the EU/EEA. Under the GDPR, fines of up to €20.0 million or up to 4% of the annual global turnover of the infringer, whichever is greater, could be imposed for certain categories of infractions that constitute significant non-compliance. The GDPR includes more stringent operational requirements for data processors and data controllers and creates additional rights for data subjects. Additionally, in June 2016, United Kingdom voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” which could also lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. In March 2017, the United Kingdom began the process to leave the EU by April 2019. While the Data Protection Act of 2018, that “implements” and complements the GDPR has achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the EEA to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under GDPR. We may incur liabilities, expenses, costs, and other operational losses under GDPR and applicable EU Member States and the United Kingdom privacy laws in connection with any measures we take to comply with them.
     Additionally, California recently enacted legislation that has been dubbed the first “GDPR-like” law in the United States. Known as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. When it goes into effect on January 1, 2020, the CCPA will require covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new causes of action for data breaches. Legislators have stated that amendments will be proposed to the CCPA before it goes into effect, but it remains unclear what, if any, modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted. As currently written, the CCPA could impact our business activities and is an example of the type of activity in an evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information that could continue to affect our operations.
     Fraud and Abuse Laws 
     In addition to FDA restrictions, there are numerous U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws. Our relationships with healthcare providers and 

 
  16

 
other third parties are subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal, civil, and administrative sanctions, including, in some instances, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including the Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. 
     Federal Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Laws 
     The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance to provide protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a review of all its relevant facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute's intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of (or purchases, or recommendations related to) federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been implicated and potentially violated.
     The penalties for violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include imprisonment for up to ten years, criminal fines of up to $100,000 per violation, possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and other penalties, including significant civil monetary penalties and integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance. Many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which do not have the same exceptions or safe harbors and apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Further, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or, collectively, PPACA. Specifically, as noted above, under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the government must prove the defendant acted "knowingly" to prove a violation occurred. The PPACA added a provision to clarify that with respect to violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, "a person need not have actual knowledge" of the statute or specific intent to commit a violation of the statute. This change effectively overturns case law interpretations that set a higher standard under which prosecutors had to prove the specific intent to violate the law. In addition, the PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
     We are providing the initial training to patients necessary for appropriate use of our products both by utilizing our own diabetes educators and by contracting with outside diabetes educators that have completed an appropriate training course.
     Federal law also includes a provision commonly known as the "Stark Law," which prohibits a physician from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity providing "designated health services," including a company that furnishes durable medical equipment, in which the physician has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician has entered into a compensation arrangement. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of payment, disgorgement of reimbursements received under a noncompliant arrangement, civil penalties, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. We believe that we have structured our provider arrangements to comply with current fraud and abuse law requirements.
     Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
    
 
  17

 

 Additionally, as some of these laws are still evolving, we lack definitive guidance as to the application of certain key aspects of these laws as they relate to our arrangements with providers with respect to patient training. As a result, our provider and training arrangements may ultimately be found to be not in compliance with applicable federal law. 
     Federal False Claims Act & HIPAA 
     The federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, amendments in 1986 to the federal False Claims Act have made it easier for private parties to bring "qui tam" whistleblower lawsuits against companies under the federal False Claims Act. Penalties include significant civil monetary penalties for each false claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, pay fines, be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs, or be subject to integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, as a result of an investigation arising out of such action.
     There are other federal anti-fraud laws that that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
     Additionally, HIPAA established two federal crimes for healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of either of these statutes is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs, or integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance. 
     Civil Monetary Penalties Law 
     In addition to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, the federal government has the authority to seek civil monetary penalties, or CMPs, assessments, and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a wide variety of prohibited conduct. For example, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law authorizes the imposition of substantial CMPs against an entity that engages in activities including, but not limited to: (1) knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, a claim for services not provided as claimed or which is otherwise false or fraudulent in any way; (2) knowingly giving or causing to be given false or misleading information reasonably expected to influence the decision to discharge a patient; (3) offering or giving remuneration to any beneficiary of a federal health care program likely to influence the receipt of reimbursable items or services; (4) arranging for reimbursable services with an entity which is excluded from participation from a federal health care program; (5) knowingly or willfully soliciting or receiving remuneration for a referral of a federal health care program beneficiary; or (6) using a payment intended for a federal health care program beneficiary for another use. Noncompliance can result in significant civil money penalties for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs.      State Fraud and Abuse Provisions 
     Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback and anti-referral laws and a false claims act, some of which apply regardless of source of payment and do not have the same exceptions as the federal laws. We believe that 

 
  18

 
we are in conformance to such laws. Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions. 
     Physician Payments Sunshine Act 
     Transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers and teaching hospitals may also impact our business practices. The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires most medical device manufacturers to report annually to CMS financial arrangements, payments, or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals. The payment information is made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website. Over the next several years, we will need to dedicate significant resources to establish and maintain systems and processes in order to comply with these regulations. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements can result in significant civil monetary penalties. Similar laws have been enacted or are under consideration in many states and foreign jurisdictions.     Healthcare Reform
    
Federal and state governments continue to propose and pass new legislation and regulations designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare. Such new laws may result in decreased reimbursement for medical devices, which may further exacerbate industry-wide pressure to reduce the prices charged for medical devices. For example. in March 2010, the PPACA, was enacted, which substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, encourages improvements in the quality of healthcare items and services and significantly impacts the medical device industry. In the years since its enactment, there have been, and continue to be, significant developments in, and continued legislative activity around, attempts to repeal or repeal and replace the PPACA. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the PPACA will impact the PPACA. 
     In May 2017, the European Commission finalized and adopted the text of the Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745, or the EU Medical Device Regulation, which will repeal and replace both Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices and Directive 90/385/EEC concerning active implantable medical devices. The majority of the provisions in the EU Medical Device Regulation apply from spring 2020. The Company will need to ensure compliance with the EU Medical Device Regulation in the future if it is to place a medical device on the EU market after this regulation comes into force.
     Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
     On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom, or UK, voted in favor of leaving the EU, commonly referred to as “Brexit”. Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the UK from the EU is expected to take effect on March 29, 2019 unless this is postponed or an agreement that the UK remain in the EU is reached. Since the regulatory framework for medical devices in the UK covering quality, safety and efficacy, clinical trials, CE marking, commercial sales and distribution is derived from EU directives and regulations, immediately following Brexit, it is expected that the UK’s regulatory regime will remain aligned to European regulations. The guidance provided by the UK confirms that, for an unspecified time-limited period, medical devices approved for the EU market and appropriately CE marked will be recognized by the UK, should the UK leave the EU without an agreement in place. Any medical devices which have been certified by UK-based Notified Bodies will need to be re-certified in the EU as UK-based Notified Bodies will not be recognized by the EU after March 29, 2019, unless an agreement to the contrary is reached between the UK and the EU. The UK has also confirmed that it will comply with all key elements of the EU Medical Device Regulation when they apply in the EU and, subject to parliamentary approval, is proposing to introduce a UK equivalent to the CE mark, to be known as the UKCA (UK Conformity Assessed) mark. However, it remains to be seen exactly how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for medical devices in the UK. In the longer term, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to medical devices and their approval in the UK.

     U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
     The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making corrupt payments, gifts or transfers to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts. 
     UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws
     The UK Bribery Act 2010 and other applicable ant-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business, generally prohibit us and our employees and intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper or prohibited payments, or anything else of value, to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. Under the UK’s Bribery Act, we may also be liable for failing to prevent a person associated with us from committing a bribery offense.
     We are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the UK and authorities in the EU, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions and embargoes on certain countries and persons, anti-money laundering laws, import and customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, collectively referred to as trade control laws. Failure to comply with the UK’s Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption laws and trade control laws could subject us to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses.
     Employees 
     As of December 31, 2018, we had 192 employees, all of whom are located in the United States. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.      Corporate Information 
     We were originally incorporated as ASN Technologies, Inc. in Nevada on June 26, 2014. On December 7, 2015, pursuant to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, or the Acquisition, we acquired Senseonics, Incorporated, a medical technology company focused on the design, development and commercialization of glucose monitoring systems to improve the lives of people with diabetes by enhancing their ability to manage their disease with relative ease and accuracy.
