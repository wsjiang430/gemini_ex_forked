 NAM believes its programs have key advantages when compared to other marketing options available to packaged goods companies, retailers and other marketers. NAM offers effective and targeted programs that reach a national audience of consumers who are actively seeking incentives or information at critical points along the path to purchase. The Company recently announced that it is reviewing strategic options for NAM, including a potential sale. There is no assurance regarding the timing of any action or transaction, nor that the strategic review will result in a transaction or other strategic change. 
 The Companys News and Information Services products compete with a wide range of media businesses, including print publications, digital media and information services. 
 The Companys newspapers, magazines, digital publications and radio stations compete for consumers, audience and advertising with other local and national newspapers, web and app-based media, magazines and radio stations, social media sources, as well as other media such as television and outdoor displays. Competition for subscriptions and circulation is based on news and editorial content, subscription pricing, cover price and, from time to time, various promotions. Competition for advertising is based upon advertisers judgments as to the most effective media for their advertising budgets, which is in turn based upon various factors, including circulation volume, readership levels, audience demographics, advertising rates and advertising effectiveness. As a result of rapidly changing and evolving technologies, distribution platforms and business models, the consumer-focused businesses within the Companys News and Information Services segment, including its newspaper businesses, continue to face increasing competition for both circulation and advertising revenue from a variety of alternative news and information sources. These include both paid and free websites, digital apps, news aggregators, blogs, search engines, social media networks, digital advertising networks and exchanges, bidding and other programmatic advertising buying channels, as well as other emerging media and distribution platforms, including off-platform distribution of its products. Shifts in consumer behavior, including the widespread adoption of mobile phones, tablets, e-book readers and other portable devices as platforms through which news and 
 
8 


  information is consumed, require the Company to continually innovate and improve upon its own products, services and platforms in order to remain competitive. The Company believes that these changes will continue to pose opportunities and challenges, and that it is well positioned to leverage its global reach, brand recognition and proprietary technology to take advantage of the opportunities presented by these changes. 
 Dow Jones professional information products that target enterprise customers compete with various information service providers, compliance data providers and global financial newswires, including Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg L.P., LexisNexis and Refinitiv, as well as many other providers of news, information and compliance data. 
 NAM competes against other providers of advertising, marketing and merchandising products and services, including those that provide promotional or advertising inserts, direct mailers of promotional or advertising materials, providers of point-of-purchase and other in-store programs and providers of savings and/or grocery-focused digital apps, as well as other marketing products and services. Competition is based on, among other things, rates, availability of markets, quality of products and services provided and their effectiveness, rate of coupon redemption, store coverage and other factors. The Company believes that based on the scale of NAMs home-delivered products, the reach of its in-store marketing products and the growing audience for its digital marketing platform, NAM provides broader consumer access than many of its competitors. The Company is also actively investing in shopper research and data-based insights that enable an advanced understanding of how to apply the Companys media and incentive network to achieve the greatest impact and value for clients and partners. 
 Subscription Video Services 
 The Companys Subscription Video Services segment provides video sports, entertainment and news services to pay-TV subscribers and other commercial licensees, primarily via cable, satellite and internet distribution. This segment consists of (i) the Companys 65% interest in NXE Australia Pty Limited, which was formed to combine News Corp and Telstra Corporation Limiteds interests in the Foxtel Group and FOX SPORTS Australia and is referred to herein as Foxtel (the remaining 35% interest in Foxtel is held by Telstra), and (ii) Australian News Channel (ANC). 
Foxtel 
 Foxtel is the largest pay-TV provider in Australia, delivering nearly 200 channels (including standard definition channels, high definition versions of some of those channels, audio channels and one 4K Ultra HD channel) covering sports, general entertainment, movies, documentaries, music, childrens programming and news. Foxtel offers the leading sports programming content in Australia, with unique rights across key sports and a suite of channels that includes FOX LEAGUE, FOX SPORTS 503, FOX FOOTY, FOX SPORTS 505, FOX SPORTS 506, FOX SPORTS MORE, FOX SPORTS NEWS and its new FOX CRICKET channel. Foxtels channels together broadcast approximately 15,000 hours of live sports programming per year, encompassing both live national and international licensed sports events such as National Rugby League, Australian Football League, Cricket Australia, the domestic football league, the Australian Rugby Union and various motorsports programming, as well as other featured original and licensed premium sports content tailored to the Australian market. Foxtels premium entertainment and news content includes television programming from HBO, FOX and NBCUniversal, as well as Foxtel-produced dramas, and 29 channels owned and operated by Foxtel, including general entertainment and movie channels (which provide an extensive range of movie programming sourced through arrangements with major U.S. studios). 
 Foxtels content is available through channels and on-demand and is currently distributed to broadcast subscribers using either cable networks accessed through Telstra or Optuss satellite platform via Foxtels set-top boxes, including the iQ4 (satellite only) and iQ3. Foxtel intends to migrate all broadcast subscribers to satellite or internet delivery over the next several years. Broadcast subscribers can also access Foxtels content using a 
 
9 


  companion service app on mobile devices and tablets. In addition, as part of its strategy to reach new segments of the Australian population, Foxtel also offers its pay-TV service via the internet through Foxtel Now, an over-the-top, or OTT, television service available on a number of compatible devices (including the Foxtel Now box, mobile devices, tablets, personal computers, Chromecast, Telstra TV, Sony PlayStation, Xbox One and select smart TVs), as well as Kayo, its recently launched sports-only OTT service that allows subscribers to stream over 50 sports live and on demand. Foxtel also offers a triple play bundle product, which consists of Foxtels existing broadcast pay-TV service, sold together with broadband and telephone services. In addition to its pay-TV services, Foxtel operates foxsports.com.au, a leading general sports website in Australia, and Watch NRL and Watch AFL, subscription services that provide live streaming and on-demand replays of National Rugby League and Australian Football League matches, internationally. 
 Foxtel generates revenue primarily through subscription revenue as well as advertising revenue. Foxtels business generally is not highly seasonal, though results can fluctuate due to the timing and mix of its local and international sports programming, as expenses associated with licensing certain programming rights are recognized during the applicable season or event. The following table provides information regarding certain key performance indicators for Foxtel (see Part I. BusinessExplanatory Note Regarding Certain Key Metrics for more information regarding the calculation of these performance indicators):

 Foxtel competes primarily with a variety of other video content providers, such as traditional Free To Air (FTA) TV operators in Australia, including the three major commercial FTA networks and two major government-funded FTA broadcasters, and new content providers that deliver video programming over the internet. These providers include Internet Protocol television, or IPTV, and subscription video-on-demand, or SVOD, providers such as Fetch TV, Netflix, Stan and Amazon Prime Video; streaming services offered through digital media providers, such as YouTube and Facebook; as well as programmers and distributors, such as CBS, Disney and the FTA networks, that provide, or have indicated an intention to provide, content, including smaller, lower-cost or free programming packages, directly to consumers over the internet. The Company believes that Foxtels premium and exclusive content, wide array of products and services, set-top box features that enable subscribers to record, rewind, discover and watch content, its investment in On Demand capability and 
 
10 


  programming and benefits through broadband bundling enable it to offer subscribers a compelling alternative to its competitors. In addition, Foxtel continues to develop new features and products to improve the value proposition of its broadcast television packages and expand its subscriber base, including its iQ4 set-top box, 4K Ultra HD service, planned upgrades to its user interface to make content discovery easier and integrate third-party apps, and its OTT services such as Foxtel Now and the new sports streaming service Kayo. 
 Australian News Channel 
 ANC operates 10 channels featuring the latest in news, politics, sports, entertainment, public affairs, business and weather. ANC is licensed by Sky International AG to use Sky trademarks and domain names in connection with its operation and distribution of channels and services. ANCs channels consist of Sky News Live, Fox Sports News, Sky News Weather, Sky News UK, Sky News Extra, Sky News Extra 1, Sky News Extra 2, Sky News Extra 3, Sky News New Zealand and Sky News on WIN. ANC channels are distributed throughout Australia and New Zealand and available on Foxtel and Sky Network Television NZ. Sky News on WIN is available on the regional FTA WIN network in Australia. ANC also owns and operates the international Australia Channel IPTV service and offers content across a variety of digital media platforms, including mobile, podcasts and social media websites. ANC primarily generates revenue through monthly affiliate fees received from pay-TV providers based on the number of subscribers and advertising. 
 ANC competes primarily with other news providers in Australia and New Zealand via its subscription television channels, third party content arrangements and free domain website. Its Australia Channel IPTV service also competes against OTT and IPTV subscription-based news providers in regions outside of Australia and New Zealand. 
 Book Publishing 
 The Companys Book Publishing segment consists of HarperCollins, the second largest consumer book publisher in the world based on global revenue, with operations in 17 countries. HarperCollins publishes and distributes consumer books globally through print, digital and audio formats. Its digital formats include e-books and downloadable audio books for tablets, e-book readers and mobile devices. HarperCollins owns more than 120 branded imprints, including Harper, William Morrow, HarperCollins Childrens Books, Avon, Harlequin and Christian publishers Zondervan and Thomas Nelson. 
 HarperCollins publishes works by well-known authors such as Harper Lee, Chip and Joanna Gaines, Rick Warren, Sarah Young and Agatha Christie and popular titles such as The Hobbit, Goodnight Moon, To Kill a Mockingbird, Jesus Calling and Hillbilly Elegy. Its print and digital global catalog includes more than 200,000 publications in different formats, in 16 languages, and it licenses rights for its authors works to be published in more than 50 languages around the world. HarperCollins publishes fiction and nonfiction, with a focus on general, childrens and religious content. Additionally, in the U.K., HarperCollins publishes titles for the equivalent of the K-12 educational market. 
 As of June 30, 2019, HarperCollins offered approximately 100,000 publications in digital formats, and nearly all of HarperCollins new titles, as well as the majority of its entire catalog, are available as e-books. Digital sales, comprising revenues generated through the sale of e-books as well as downloadable audio books, represented approximately 20% of global consumer revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. With the widespread adoption of electronic formats by consumers, HarperCollins is publishing a number of titles in digital formats before, or instead of, publishing a print edition. 
 During fiscal 2019, HarperCollins U.S. had 141 titles on the New York Times print and digital bestseller lists, with 22 titles hitting number one, including Girl, Wash Your Face and Girl, Stop Apologizing by Rachel Hollis, Homebody, Magnolia Table and We Are the Gardeners by Joanna Gaines, The Hate U Give and On the Come Up by Angie Thomas, Everything is F*cked by Mark Manson, The Russia Hoax by Gregg Jarrett, The Other Woman

by Daniel Silva, The Woman in the Window by A.J. Finn, The Tattooist of Auschwitz by Heather Morris, Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, You Are My Happy by Hoda Kotbe, Dear Boy by Paris Rosenthal & Jason Rosenthal, The Good Egg by Jory John and Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain. 
 HarperCollins derives its revenue from the sale of print and digital books to a customer base that includes global technology companies, traditional brick and mortar booksellers, wholesale clubs and discount stores, including Amazon, Apple, Barnes & Noble and Tesco. Revenues at the Book Publishing segment are significantly affected by the timing of releases and the number of HarperCollins books in the marketplace, and are typically highest during the Companys second fiscal quarter due to increased demand during the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. 
 The book publishing business operates in a highly competitive market that is quickly changing and continues to see technological innovations. HarperCollins competes with other large publishers, such as Penguin Random House, Simon & Schuster and Hachette Livre, as well as with numerous smaller publishers, for the rights to works by well-known authors and public personalities; competition could also come from new entrants as barriers to entry in book publishing are low. In addition, HarperCollins competes for consumers with other media formats and sources such as movies, television programming, magazines and mobile content. The Company believes HarperCollins is well positioned in the evolving book publishing market with significant size and brand recognition across multiple categories and geographies. Furthermore, HarperCollins is a leader in childrens and religious books, categories which have been less impacted by the transition to digital consumption. 
 Digital Real Estate Services 
 The Companys Digital Real Estate Services segment consists of its 61.6% interest in REA Group, a publicly-traded company listed on ASX (ASX: REA), and its 80% interest in Move. The remaining 20% interest in Move is held by REA Group. 
 REA Group 
 REA Group is a market-leading digital media business specializing in property, with operations focused on property and property-related advertising and services, as well as financial services. 
 Property and Property-Related Advertising and Services 
 REA Group advertises property and property-related services on its websites and mobile apps across Australia and Asia. REA Groups Australian operations include leading residential, commercial and share property websites realestate.com.au, realcommercial.com.au, Flatmates.com.au and spacely.com.au. Additionally, REA Group operates media display and data services businesses, serving the display media market and markets adjacent to property, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2019, average monthly visits to realestate.com.au were approximately 76.8 million. Launches of the realestate.com.au app increased 21% to 29.4 million average monthly launches in fiscal 2019 as compared to the prior year, with consumers spending more than 4.7 times longer on the app than any other property app in Australia according to Nielsen Digital Content Ratings. Realcommercial.com.au remains Australias leading commercial property site across website and app. In fiscal 2019, the realcommercial.com.au app was launched 8.8 times more than the nearest competitor, and consumers spent more than 7.0 times longer on the realcommercial.com.au app based on Nielsen Digital Content Ratings data. Flatmates.com.au is the largest site for share accommodation in Australia, with average monthly visits of more than 3.0 million and more than 450,000 new members during fiscal 2019. Spacely.com.au is the leading advertising portal for short term commercial and co-working spaces in Australia with more than 4,000 property listings throughout Australia. 
 Realestate.com.au and realcommerical.com.au derive the majority of their revenue from their core property advertising listing products and monthly advertising subscriptions from real estate agents and property 
 
12 


  developers. Realestate.com.au and realcommercial.com.au offer a product hierarchy which enables real estate agents and property developers to upgrade listing advertisements to increase their prominence on the site, as well as a variety of targeted products, including media display advertising products. Flatmates.com.au and spacely.com.au derive the majority of their revenue from their shared space advertising listing products and booking fees. The media business offers unique advertising opportunities on REA Groups websites to property developers and other relevant markets, including utilities and telecommunications, insurance, finance, automotive and retail. REA Group also provides residential property data services to the financial sector through its Hometrack data services business. 
 REA Groups international operations consist of property sites throughout Asia, including leading property portals in Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong and Thailand, and prominent portals in Singapore and China. In fiscal 2019, REA Group consolidated its two brands in Hong Kong and launched a new squarefoot.com.hk, which became Hong Kongs leading property portal in June 2019. In Malaysia, iproperty.com.my became the first major property portal to offer a search experience in the local Bahasa language, enabling the business to reach more than 69% of the local population. REA Group also operates Chinese site myfun.com, which supports REA Groups businesses in other geographic markets by showcasing residential property listings to Chinese buyers and investors, and delivers leads to agents. REA Groups other assets include an approximate 13% interest in Elara Technologies Pte. Ltd. (Elara), a leading online real estate services provider in India that owns and operates PropTiger.com, Housing.com and Makaan.com, and a 20% interest in Move, as referenced above. 
 Financial Services 
 REA Groups financial services business encompasses realestate.com.au Home Loans, an end-to-end digital property search and financing experience, and mortgage broking services, both through an integrated mortgage broking solution, as well as Smartline Home Loans Pty Limited, one of Australias premier mortgage broking companies. The financial services business generates revenue primarily through fees and commissions from lenders, mortgage brokers and other customers. Since launching realestate.com.au Home Loans in 2017, applications for more than A$1.8 billion (approximately US$1.3 billion) of loans have been received. 
 REA Group competes primarily with other property websites in its geographic markets, including domain.com.au in Australia. 
 Move 
 Move is a leading provider of online real estate services in the U.S. Move primarily operates realtor.com®, a premier real estate information and services marketplace, under a perpetual agreement and trademark license with the National Association of Realtors® (NAR). Through realtor.com®, consumers have access to over 135 million properties across the U.S., including an extensive collection of homes and properties listed and displayed for sale and a large database of off-market properties. Realtor.com® and its related mobile apps display approximately 98% of all Multiple Listing Services (MLS)-listed, for-sale and rental properties in the U.S., which are primarily sourced directly from relationships with MLSs across the country. Approximately 95% of its for-sale listings are updated at least every 15 minutes, on average, with the remaining listings updated daily. Realtor.com®s content attracts a highly engaged consumer audience. Based on internal data, realtor.com® and its mobile sites had 72 million average monthly unique users during the quarter ended June 30, 2019. See Part I. BusinessExplanatory Note Regarding Certain Key Metrics. These users viewed an average of over two billion pages and spent an average of over two billion minutes on the realtor.com® website and mobile apps each month. 
 Realtor.com® generates the majority of its revenues through the sale of listing advertisement products, including ConnectionsSM Plus and AdvantageSM Pro, as well as its recently acquired Opcity performance and subscription-based services. Listing advertisement products allow real estate agents, brokers and franchises to enhance, prioritize and connect with consumers on for-sale property listings within the realtor.com® website and mobile 
 
13 


  apps. Listing advertisements are typically sold on a subscription basis. Opcitys concierge-based business model leverages its proprietary technology and platform to connect real estate professionals and other service providers, such as lenders and insurance companies, to Opcitys pre-vetted consumers. Opcitys performance-based services connect real estate agents and brokers with these consumers and typically generate success fees upon completion of the associated real estate transaction, while the subscription-based services give service providers access to the same highly qualified home shoppers. Realtor.com® also derives revenue from sales of non-listing advertisement, or Media, products to real estate, finance, insurance, home improvement and other professionals that enable those professionals to connect with realtor.com®s highly engaged and valuable consumer audience. Media products include sponsorships, display advertisements, text links, directories and Digital Advertising Package. Non-listing advertisement pricing models include cost per thousand, cost per click, cost per unique user and subscription-based sponsorships of specific content areas or targeted geographies. 
 In addition to realtor.com®, Move also offers a number of professional software and services products. These include the Top Producer® productivity and lead management tools and services, which are tailored to real estate agents and sold on a subscription basis, as well as the ListHubTM service, which syndicates for-sale listing information from MLSs and other reliable data sources, such as real estate brokerages, and distributes that content to an array of web sites. Listing syndication pricing includes fixed- or variable-pricing models based on listing counts, while ListHubTMs advanced reporting products are sold on a monthly subscription basis. 
 Move competes primarily with other real estate websites and mobile apps focused on the U.S. real estate market, including zillow.com and trulia.com. 
 Other 
 The Other segment includes the Companys general corporate overhead expenses, corporate Strategy Group and costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters. The Companys Strategy Group identifies new products and services across the Companys businesses to increase revenues and profitability and targets and assesses potential acquisitions, investments and dispositions. Initiatives include News IQ, the Companys data-driven digital advertising platform that enables targeting and engagement of premium audiences at scale across the Companys network of assets. As part of its ongoing role in assessing potential acquisitions and investments, the Strategy Group also oversaw the Companys acquisitions of Move, a leading provider of online real estate services in the U.S., Unruly, a global video advertising marketplace, and Wireless Group, operator of talkSPORT, the leading sports radio network in the U.K. The Strategy Group also oversees the Companys strategic digital investments in India, including Elara, which owns PropTiger.com, Housing.com and Makaan.com. 
Governmental Regulation 
 General 
 Various aspects of the Companys activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world. The introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the Companys products and services are produced or distributed, and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries, could have a negative impact on the Companys interests. 
Australian Media Regulation 
 The Companys subscription television interests are subject to Australias regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry, including the Australian Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) (the Broadcasting Services Act) and the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) (the Telecommunications Act) and associated Codes. The key regulatory body for the Australian broadcasting industry is the Australian Communications and Media Authority. 
 Key regulatory issues for subscription television providers include: (a) anti-siphoning restrictionscurrently under the anti-siphoning provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act, subscription television providers are 
 
14 


  prevented from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the Olympic Games and certain Australian Rules football and cricket matches) unless national or commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 26 weeks before the start of the event or the rights are held by commercial television licensees whose television broadcasting services cover more than 50% of the Australian population or the rights are held by one of Australias two major government-funded broadcasters; and (b) other parts of the Broadcasting Services Act that may impact the Companys ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities. Foxtel is also subject to various consumer protection regimes under the Telecommunications Act and associated Codes, which apply to Foxtel as a telecommunications service provider. 
 Data Privacy and Security 
 The Companys business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which continue to evolve and have implications for how such data is managed. For example, in the U.S., certain of the Companys websites, mobile apps and other online business activities are subject to the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, which prohibits the collection of personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission continues to expand its application of general consumer protection laws to commercial data practices, including to the use of personal and profiling data from online users to deliver targeted internet advertisements. More state and local governments are also expanding, enacting or proposing data privacy laws that govern the collection and use of personal data of their residents and increase penalties and afford private rights of action to individuals in certain circumstances for failure to comply, and most states have enacted legislation requiring businesses to provide notice to state agencies and to individuals whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which will take effect on January 1, 2020, is one such example, putting greater restrictions on how the Company can collect and use personal information. 
 Similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including the European Union and Australia. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is intended to provide a uniform set of rules for personal data processing throughout the European Union and to replace the existing Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC). Fully applicable and enforceable as of May 25, 2018, the GDPR expands the regulation of the collection, processing, use and security of personal data, contains stringent conditions for consent from data subjects, strengthens the rights of individuals, including the right to have personal data deleted upon request, continues to restrict the trans-border flow of such data, requires companies to conduct privacy impact assessments to evaluate data processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, requires mandatory data breach reporting and notification, significantly increases maximum penalties for non-compliance (up to 20 million Euros, or approximately 23 million U.S. dollars, or 4% of an entitys worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is higher) and increases the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities. The European Union is also considering an update to its Privacy and Electronic Communication (e-Privacy) Directive with a regulation to, among other things, amend the current directives rules on the use of cookies and opt-outs.
In 2016, the European Commission adopted a new mechanism for the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the United States called the Privacy Shield. Other than for one business unit operating an advertising exchange, the Company has not certified to, and does not rely on, the Privacy Shield framework for data transfers among the Companys businesses and instead relies on other mechanisms. However, certain of the Companys service providers do rely on the Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield is subject to significant uncertainty, including an annual review procedure by U.S. and E.U. authorities and a legal challenge scheduled to be heard by the General Court of the E.U. in July 2019, that could affect the Companys or its service providers obligations thereunder. The other mechanisms that the Company and certain of its service providers rely on to address the European data protection requirements for transfers of data, including the European Union 
 
15 


  Standard Contractual Clauses, are also subject to uncertainty and legal challenges. Challenges to existing data transfer mechanisms, and any future legal challenges to data transfer mechanisms that may be adopted, could cause the Company to incur additional costs, require it to change business practices or affect the manner in which it provides its services. 
 In Australia, data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by, among other things, requiring the disclosure of cross-border data transfers, placing restrictions on direct marketing practices and imposing mandatory data breach reporting, and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration. 
 Industry participants in the U.S., Europe and Australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industry-level standards and practices, including the implementation of self-regulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies, such as the Company, to give consumers a better understanding of advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior. 
 The interpretation and application of data privacy and security laws are often uncertain, in flux, and evolving in the United States and internationally. The Company continues to monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments, including any changes required in the Companys data privacy and security compliance programs. 
 U.K. Press Regulation 
 As a result of the implementation of recommendations of the Leveson inquiry into the U.K. press, a Press Recognition Panel responsible for approving, overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies was established. Once approved by the Press Recognition Panel, the new press regulatory body or bodies would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers. In addition to the Press Recognition Panel, certain legislation provides that publishers who are not members of an approved regulator may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded and, if Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 is enacted, the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances. 
 Press regulator IMPRESS was recognized as an approved regulator by the Press Recognition Panel on October 25, 2016. However, publications representing the majority of the industry in the U.K., including News UK, entered into binding contracts to form an alternative regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, or IPSO, in September 2014. IPSO currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the Press Recognition Panel. IPSO has an independent chairman and a 12-member board, the majority of which are independent. IPSO oversees the Editors Code of Practice, requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires self-reporting of any failures, provides a complaints handling service, has the ability to require publications to print corrections and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the Editors Code of Practice and levy fines of up to £1 million. IPSO has also introduced an arbitration scheme to resolve claims against publications. The burdens IPSO imposes on its print media members, including the Companys newspaper publishing businesses in the U.K., may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance. 
U.K. Radio Broadcasting Regulation 
 The Companys radio stations in the U.K. and Ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the Company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations. Although the Company expects its licenses will, where relevant, be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Non-compliance by the Company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations, including of the relevant authority, could result in fines, additional license conditions, license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions.

 Intellectual Property 
 The Companys intellectual property assets include: copyrights in newspapers, books, television programming and other content and technologies; trademarks in names and logos; trade names; domain names; and licenses of intellectual property rights. These licenses include: (1) the sports programming rights licenses for the National Rugby League, Australian Football League, Cricket Australia, V8 Supercars, Formula One, Football Federation Australia, Australian Rugby Union and other broadcasting rights described in Note 16 to the Financial Statements; (2) licenses from various third parties, including ARRIS, of patents and other technology for the set-top boxes and related operating and conditional access systems used in the Companys pay-TV business; (3) the trademark license for the realtor.com® website address, as well as the REALTOR® trademark (the NAR License); and (4) the trademark licenses for the use of FOX formative trademarks used in the Companys pay-TV business in Australia (the Fox Licenses). In addition, its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services, none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations. The Company derives value and revenue from its intellectual property assets through, among other things, print and digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales, subscriptions to its pay-TV services and distribution and/or licensing of its television programming to other television services, the sale, distribution and/or licensing of print and digital books, the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services and the operation of websites and other digital properties. 
 The Company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the U.S., the U.K., Australia and other foreign territories. To protect these assets, the Company relies upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. Piracy, including in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. Policing unauthorized use of the Companys products, services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the Companys intellectual property. The Company seeks to limit the threat of piracy by preventing unauthorized access to its content through the use of programming content encryption, signal encryption and other security access devices and digital rights management software, as well as by obtaining site blocking orders against pirate streaming and torrent sites and a variety of other actions. The Company also seeks to limit such threat by pursuing legal sanctions for infringement, promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. However, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. Therefore, the Company also engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world, including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement. 
 Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the Companys intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the Companys operations. 
 Raw Materials 
 As a major publisher of newspapers, magazines, free-standing inserts and books, the Company utilizes substantial quantities of various types of paper. In order to obtain the best available prices, substantially all of the Companys paper purchasing is done on a regional, volume purchase basis, and draws upon major paper manufacturing countries around the world. The Company believes that under present market conditions, its sources of paper supply used in its publishing activities are adequate. 
Employees

 Explanatory Note Regarding Certain Key Metrics 
 Unique Users 
 For purposes of this Annual Report, the Company counts unique users the first time an individual accesses a products website using a browser during a calendar month and the first time an individual accesses a products mobile or tablet app using a mobile or tablet device during a calendar month. If the user accesses more than one of a products desktop websites, mobile websites, mobile apps and/or tablet apps, the first access to each such website or app is counted as a separate unique user. In addition, users accessing a products websites through different browsers, users who clear their browser cache at any time and users who access a products websites and apps through different devices are also counted as separate unique users. For a group of products such as WSJDN, a user accessing different products within the group is counted as a separate unique user for each product accessed. 
Broadcast Subscribers 
 Broadcast subscribers consist of residential subscribers and commercial subscribers, which are calculated as described below. 
 Residential Subscribers 
 Total number of residential subscribers represents total residential subscribers to the Companys pay-TV services through cable and satellite distribution, including subscribers obtained through third-party distribution relationships. 
 Commercial Subscribers 
 Commercial subscribers for the Companys pay-TV business are calculated as residential equivalent business units, which are derived by dividing total recurring revenue from these subscribers by an estimated average Broadcast ARPU which is held constant through the year. Total number of commercial subscribers represents total commercial subscribers to the Companys pay-TV services through cable and satellite distribution, including subscribers obtained through third-party distribution relationships. 
 Broadcast ARPU 
 The Company calculates Broadcast ARPU for its pay-TV business by dividing broadcast package revenues for the period, net of customer credits, promotions and other discounts, by average cable and satellite residential subscribers for the period and dividing by the number of months in the period. Average cable and satellite residential subscribers, or Average Broadcast Subscribers, for a given period is calculated by first adding the beginning and ending cable and satellite residential subscribers for each month in the period and dividing by two and then adding each of those monthly average subscriber numbers and dividing by the number of months in the period. 
 Broadcast Subscriber Churn 
 The Company calculates Broadcast Subscriber Churn for its pay-TV business by dividing the total number of disconnected cable and satellite residential subscribers for the period, net of reconnects and transfers, by the Average Broadcast Subscribers for the period, calculated as described above. This amount is then divided by the number of days in the period and multiplied by 365 days to present churn on an annual basis.
