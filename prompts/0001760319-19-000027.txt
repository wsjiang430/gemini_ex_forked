When we use the terms “Kid Castle,” “KDCE,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and “the company,” we mean Kid Castle Educational Corporation, a Delaware corporation.
 
Corporate History
 
Kid Castle Educational Corporation (“KDCE”) was the result of a share exchange transaction, commonly referred to as a reverse merger, pursuant to which shareholders of an offshore operating company take control of a U.S. company that has no operations (commonly referred to as a shell company), and the offshore operating company becomes a subsidiary of the U.S. company. In KDCE case, the offshore company was Higoal Developments Ltd., which was the parent company of Kid Castle Internet Technologies Limited and Kid Castle Education Software Development Co. Limited, KDCE’s operating companies that run our English language instruction business. The U.S. or shell company, at the time of the share exchange, was King Ball International Technology Corporation.
 
The details of KDCE corporate history are as follows. KDCE was incorporated in Florida on July 19, 1985 as Omni Doors, Inc. From inception through June 30, 1998, our primary business was the assembly and distribution of industrial doors for sale to building contractors in the South Florida market. Until April 6, 1998, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Millennia, Inc., a publicly-owned Delaware corporation. On April 6, 1998, the Board of Directors of Millennia declared the payment of a stock dividend to Millennia’s stockholders. Millennia stockholders received one share of our common stock for each four shares of Millennia common stock. This distribution of approximately 570,000 shares of our company represented approximately 5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our common stock.
 
Pursuant to a contract dated July 14, 1998, Millennia sold 10,260,000 shares (representing 90% of the total outstanding shares) of our common stock to an unrelated firm, China Economic Growth Investment Corp., LLC, which then distributed the shares to its three members, Yong Chen, Zuxiang Huang, and Zheng Yao.
 
On April 6, 2001, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated April 2, 2001, Halter Capital Corporation, a privately-owned Texas corporation, purchased 6,822,900 shares of our common stock from Zheng Yao, representing approximately 60% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Simultaneously with this change-in-control transaction, Sophia Yao, our then sole officer and director, resigned. Kevin B. Halter, Sr., as President and director, and Kevin B. Halter, Jr., as Secretary-Treasurer and director, were elected to replace her.
 
On June 19, 2002, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated June 6, 2002, Powerlink International Finance, Inc., a British Virgin Islands corporation, purchased 2,830,926 shares of our common stock from Halter Capital Corporation, representing approximately 57% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Simultaneously with the purchase, the officers and directors of the Company resigned. Chin-Chung Hsu, President, Treasurer, and Director; Wen-Hao Hsu, Secretary and Director; and Chien-Hwa Liu, Director, were elected to replace them.
 
On June 25, 2002, we changed our name to King Ball International Technology Corporation and, on August 22, 2002, we changed our name again to Kid Castle Educational Corporation. On October 1, 2002, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of Higoal, a Cayman Islands company, pursuant to an Exchange Agreement dated as of October 1, 2002 (the “Exchange Agreement”). The Exchange Agreement was among Higoal, the shareholders of Higoal, Kuo-An Wang, and Kid Castle. Higoal, which is based in Taipei, Taiwan, is the parent company of KCIT and KCES. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, Higoal became our wholly-owned subsidiary. In exchange for 100% of the issued and fully paid-up capital of Higoal, we issued 11,880,000 shares of our common stock to the shareholders of Higoal. As a result of the share exchange, the former shareholders of Higoal hold a majority of our outstanding capital stock.
 

 On December 27, 2006 we established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Shanghai Kid Castle Educational Info. Constitution Company Limited (“KCEI”) with registered total capital of Renmibi ("RMB") $1.2 million. As of December 31, 2008, KCEI has a total registered capital of RMB3,500,000.
 
On October 21, 2019, the company sold one (1) million shares of its preferred shares (one preferred share is convertible 1,000 share of common stocks) of the company to Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc., a California corporation. The issuance of the preferred shares to Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc gave to Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc, the controlling vote to control and dominate the affairs of the company.
 
Following the share sales to Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc., the purchaser converted 70,000 of the preferred shares for 70,000,000 shares of the Company's current outstanding shares of common stock.  Following the change of control, all the former officers of company resigned their appointments and Mr. Frank I Igwealor was appointed as the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors effective October 23, 2019.  Furthermore, Mr. Igwealor, Dr. Solomon SK Mbagwu, MD, and Ms. Patience C Ogbozor were also nominated as new director of the Company. 
 
This acquisition of control by Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. has transformed our business model going forward.   Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. (CBDZ) has stated its intention to direct the Company into the following areas of the legal CBD business: (1) Ownership interest in certain businesses that extract, purchase and distribute Bulk Pure CBD, Isolate, Hemp Oil, THC-free CBD Distillate and Crude CBD Oil; (2) Partnerships with local farmers to grow farm bill compliant hemp biomass; (3) Partnerships with extract facilities across the U.S. who manufacture hemp-based ingredients to meet the specific needs financial products in form of asset-backed loans, business property mortgages and other financial products to qualified individuals/businesses in the legal-CBD businesses.
 
CBDZ intend to use the company to established CBD process control, protocols, and formulations standardization.  CBDZ intend to push the Company to step up and pioneer the process to standardize and reorganize this market, establish process control (benchmarks and protocols), and create formulation standards for the CBD industry. Through Kid Castle, CBDZ seeks to control the production and distribution of verities of consumer cannabidiol (CBD) formulation under private brands in the United States. CBDZ’s goal is to bring standardization to the CBD industry, the same way that John D Rockefeller’s Standard Oil brought standardization to crude refining in the United States in the nineteenth century.  Our process standardization would entail steps that include (a) ethanol extraction system, (b) winterization to remove fats; (c) multiple rounds of rotary evaporation are used to remove plant material and other unnecessary components; (d) extract decarboxylation to transform into a crystalline structure with a proprietary post-processing technique; and (e) get the extract tested by third-party laboratories, package it, and get it ready for shipment.
