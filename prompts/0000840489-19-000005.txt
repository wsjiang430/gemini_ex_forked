Item 1. Business
General
The Company is a leading operator of retail pawn stores in the U.S. and Latin America. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 2,473 locations, consisting of 1,094 stores in 24 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, 1,323 stores in all 32 states in Mexico, 39 stores in Guatemala, 13 stores in El Salvador and four stores in Colombia. 

The Company’s primary business is the operation of full-service pawn stores, also known as “pawnshops,” which make pawn loans secured by personal property such as consumer electronics, jewelry, tools, household appliances, sporting goods and musical instruments. Pawn stores also generate significant retail sales of merchandise acquired through collateral forfeitures on forfeited pawn loans and over-the-counter purchases of merchandise directly from customers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 97% of the Company’s revenues were derived from pawn operations. The Company’s strategy is to focus on growing its full-service pawn operations in the U.S. and Latin America through a combination of new store openings and strategic acquisition opportunities as they arise. 
Pawn stores provide customers with instant access to capital through small non-recourse pawn loans or buying merchandise from its customers. Pawn loans can be quickly and easily accessed by customers who often have limited access to traditional credit products. Pawn loans are safe and affordable non-recourse loans for which the customer has no legal obligation to repay. The Company does not attempt to collect on delinquent loans, does not take legal actions against its customers, does not blacklist its customers, nor does it issue any negative external credit reporting, but rather relies only on the resale of the pawn collateral for recovery. 
Pawnshops also contribute to the modern “circular economy.” The retail merchandise sold in pawnshops is almost entirely sourced locally from its customers and is sold at significant discounts compared to similar “new” items offered by other retailers. By acquiring and reselling popular consumer products, the Company and its customers are extending the lifetime value of goods. The Company also provides an interest-free layaway program which assists cash and credit-constrained shoppers in acquiring retail merchandise by offering affordable payments over time. 
The Company organizes its operations into two reportable segments: the U.S. operations segment and the Latin America operations segment. The U.S. operations segment consists of all pawn and consumer loan operations in the U.S. and the Latin America operations segment consists of all pawn and consumer loan operations in Latin America, which includes operations in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Colombia. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 69% of total revenues were derived from the U.S. and 31% were derived from Latin America. For additional historical information on the composition of revenues from the U.S. and Latin America, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations.” 
On September 1, 2016, the Company completed its merger with Cash America International, Inc. (“Cash America”), whereby Cash America merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). The accompanying audited consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes the results of operations for Cash America for the period September 2, 2016 to December 31, 2016, thereby affecting comparability to fiscal 2018 and 2017 amounts, which include the results of operations for Cash America for the full respective periods. 
The Company was formed as a Texas corporation in July 1988. In April 1991, the Company reincorporated as a Delaware corporation. The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 1600 West 7th Street, Fort Worth, Texas 76102, and its telephone number is (817) 335-1100.

Pawn Industry 
The Company’s pawn stores directly compete in both the specialty retail and consumer finance industries. Pawn stores are neighborhood-based retail stores that buy and sell consumer items such as consumer electronics, jewelry, tools, appliances, sporting goods and musical instruments. Pawn stores also provide a quick and convenient source of small consumer loans to unbanked, under-banked and credit-challenged customers. These consumers are typically not effectively or efficiently served by traditional lenders such as banks, credit unions, credit card providers or other small loan providers. 
United States
The pawn industry in the U.S. is well established, with the highest concentration of pawn stores located in the Southeast, Midwest and Southwest regions of the country. The operation of pawn stores is governed primarily by state laws and accordingly, states that maintain regulations most conducive to profitable pawn operations have historically seen the greatest concentration of pawn stores. Management believes the U.S. pawn industry, although mature, remains highly fragmented. The two major publicly traded companies in the pawn industry, which includes the Company, currently operate approximately 1,600 of the estimated 12,000 to 14,000 pawn stores in the U.S. The Company believes the majority of pawnshops in the U.S. are owned by individuals operating five or fewer locations.
Mexico and Other Latin American Markets
The majority of pawn stores in Latin America are smaller than U.S. pawn stores, with limited retail space and pawn loans typically collateralized by gold jewelry or small consumer electronics. In contrast, a majority of the Company’s pawn stores in Latin America are larger format, full-service stores, similar to the U.S. stores, which lend on a wide array of collateral and have a larger retail sales floor. Accordingly, competition in Latin America with the Company’s larger format, full-service pawn stores is limited. A large percentage of the population in Mexico and other countries in Latin America is unbanked or under-banked and has limited access to consumer credit. The Company believes there is significant opportunity for further expansion in Mexico and other Latin American countries due to the large potential consumer base and limited competition from other large format, full-service pawn store operators.
Business Strategy 
The Company’s business plan is to increase revenues and long-term profitability by opening new (“de novo”) retail pawn locations, acquiring existing pawn stores in strategic markets and attempting to increase revenue and operating profits in existing stores. In pursuing its business strategy, the Company seeks to establish clusters of several stores in specific geographic areas with favorable regulations and customer demographics and to achieve certain economies of scale relative to management and supervision, pricing and purchasing, information and accounting systems and marketing.
The Company has opened or acquired 1,750 pawn stores in the last five fiscal years. Net store additions have grown at a compound annual store growth rate of 22% over this period. The Company intends to open additional stores in locations where management believes appropriate demand and other favorable conditions exist. The following table details stores opened and acquired over the five year period ended December 31, 2018:

For additional information on store count activity, see “Locations and Operations” below.
New Store Openings
The Company plans to continue opening new pawn stores, primarily in Latin America, and to a much lesser extent, in the U.S. The Company typically opens new stores in under-developed markets, especially where customer demographics are favorable and competition is limited or restricted. After a suitable location has been identified and a lease and the appropriate licenses are obtained, a new store can typically be open for business within six to 12 weeks. The investment required to open a new location includes store operating cash, inventory, funds for pawn loans, leasehold improvements, store fixtures, security systems, computer equipment and other start-up costs. 
Acquisitions
Due to the fragmented nature of the pawn industry, the Company believes attractive acquisition opportunities will continue to arise from time to time in both Latin America and the U.S. Before making an acquisition, management assesses the demographic characteristics of the surrounding area, considers the number, proximity and size of competing stores, and researches federal, state and local regulatory standards. Specific pawn store acquisition criteria include an evaluation of the volume of merchandise sales and pawn transactions, outstanding customer pawn loan balances, historical pawn yields, merchandise sales margins, pawn loan redemption rates, the condition and quantity of inventory on hand and the location, condition and lease terms of the facility.
Enhance Productivity of Existing and Newly Opened Stores 
The primary factors affecting the profitability of the Company’s existing store base are the volume and gross profit of merchandise sales, the volume of and yield on pawn loans and store operating expenses. To encourage customer traffic, which management believes is a key determinant of a store’s success, the Company has taken several steps to distinguish its stores and to make customers feel more comfortable. In addition to a clean and secure physical store facility, the stores’ exteriors typically display attractive and distinctive signage similar to that used by contemporary specialty retailers. 
The Company has employee-training programs that promote customer service, productivity and professionalism. The Company utilizes a proprietary computer information system that provides fully-integrated functionality to support point-of-sale retail operations, real-time merchandise valuations, loan-to-value calculations, inventory management, customer recordkeeping, loan management, compliance and control systems and employee compensation. Each store is connected on a real-time basis to a secure data center that houses the centralized databases and operating systems. The information systems provide management with the ability to continuously monitor store transactions and operating results.

The Company maintains a well-trained internal audit staff that conducts regular store audits to test compliance of financial and operational controls. Management believes the current operating and financial controls and systems are adequate for the Company’s existing store base and can accommodate reasonably foreseeable growth in the near term.
Services Offered by the Company
Pawn Merchandise Sales
The Company’s pawn merchandise sales are primarily retail sales to the general public from its pawn stores. The items the Company sells generally consist of pre-owned consumer electronics, jewelry, tools, household appliances, sporting goods and musical instruments. The Company also melts certain quantities of scrap jewelry and sells the gold, silver and diamonds in commodity markets. Merchandise sales accounted for approximately 67% of the Company’s revenue during fiscal 2018.
Merchandise inventory is acquired primarily through forfeited pawn loan collateral and, to a lesser extent, through purchases of used goods directly from the general public. Merchandise acquired by the Company through forfeited pawn loan collateral is carried in inventory at the amount of the related pawn loan, exclusive of any accrued service fees. The Company also acquires limited quantities of new or refurbished general merchandise inventories directly from wholesalers and manufacturers. 
The Company does not provide direct financing to customers for the purchase of its merchandise, but does permit its customers to purchase merchandise on an interest-free “layaway” plan. Should the customer fail to make a required payment pursuant to a layaway plan, the item is returned to inventory and previous payments are typically forfeited to the Company. Interim payments from customers on layaway sales are recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recorded as retail merchandise sales revenue when the merchandise is delivered to the customer upon receipt of final payment or when previous payments are forfeited to the Company.
Retail sales are seasonally highest in the fourth quarter associated with holiday shopping and, to a lesser extent, in the first quarter associated with tax refunds in the U.S.
Pawn Lending Activities 
The Company’s pawn stores make small, secured loans to its customers in order to help them meet short-term cash needs. All pawn loans are collateralized by personal property such as consumer electronics, jewelry, tools, household appliances, sporting goods and musical instruments. The pledged collateral provides the only security to the Company for the repayment of the loan. The Company does not investigate the creditworthiness of the borrower, primarily relying instead on the marketability and sales value of pledged goods as a basis for its credit decision. Pawn loans are non-recourse loans and a customer does not have a legal obligation to repay a pawn loan. There is no collections process and the decision to not repay the loan will not affect the customer’s credit score. 
At the time a pawn loan transaction is entered into, an agreement or contract, commonly referred to as a “pawn ticket,” is delivered to the borrower for signature that sets forth, among other items, the name and address of the pawnshop, the borrower’s name, the borrower’s identification number from his/her driver’s license or other government issued identification, date, identification and description of the pledged goods, including applicable serial numbers, amount financed, pawn service fee, maturity date, total amount that must be paid to redeem the pledged goods on the maturity date and the annual percentage rate.
Pledged property is held in a secured, non-public area of the pawn store through the term of the loan, unless the loan is repaid earlier. In certain markets, the Company also provides pawn loans collateralized by automobiles, which typically remain in the possession of the customer. The term of a pawn loan is typically 30 days plus an additional grace period of 14 to 90 days, depending on geographic markets and local regulations. Pawn loans may be either paid in full with accrued pawn loan fees and service charges or, where permitted by law, may be renewed or extended by the customer’s payment of accrued pawn loan fees and service charges. If a pawn loan is not repaid prior to the expiration of the grace period, the pawn collateral is forfeited to the Company and transferred to inventory at a value equal to the principal amount of the loan, exclusive of accrued service fees. The Company does not record pawn loan losses or charge-offs because the amount advanced becomes the carrying cost of the forfeited collateral that is to be recovered through the merchandise sales function described above.
The pawn loan fees are typically calculated as a percentage of the pawn loan amount based on the size, duration and type of collateral of the pawn loan and generally range from 4% to 25% per month, as permitted by applicable law. As required by applicable law, the amounts of these charges are disclosed to the customer on the pawn ticket. Pawn loan fees accounted for approximately 30% of the Company’s revenue during fiscal 2018. 
4

The amount the Company is willing to finance for a pawn loan is primarily based on a percentage of the estimated retail value of the collateral. There are no minimum or maximum pawn loan to fair market value restrictions in connection with the Company’s lending activities. In order to estimate the value of the collateral, the Company utilizes its proprietary computer information system to recall recent selling prices of similar merchandise in its own stores. The basis for the Company’s determination of the retail value also includes such sources as precious metals spot markets, catalogs, blue books, online auction sites and retailer advertisements. These sources, together with the employees’ experience in selling similar items of merchandise in particular stores, influence the determination of the estimated retail value of such items. The Company does not utilize a standard or mandated percentage of estimated retail value in determining the amount to be financed. Rather, the employee has the authority to set the percentage for a particular item and to determine the ratio of pawn loan amount to estimated sales value with the expectation that, if the item is forfeited to the pawnshop, its subsequent sale should yield a gross profit margin consistent with the Company’s historical experience. The recovery of the principal and realization of gross profit on sales of inventory is dependent on the Company’s initial assessment of the property’s estimated retail value. Improper assessment of the retail value of the collateral in the lending function can result in reduced marketability of the property resulting in a reduced gross profit margin.
The Company typically experiences seasonal growth in its pawn loan balances in the third and fourth quarters following lower balances in the first two quarters due to the heavy repayment of pawn loans associated with statutory bonuses received by customers in the fourth quarter in Mexico and with tax refund proceeds typically received by customers in the first quarter in the U.S.
Credit Services and Consumer Loan Activities
As of December 31, 2018, the Company operated 17 stand-alone consumer loan locations in the U.S. In addition, 262 pawn locations in the U.S. also offer consumer loan products, of which 113 are the smaller format Cashland stores located in Ohio. Effective June 30, 2018, the Company ceased to offer unsecured consumer loan products in Mexico and closed its remaining stand-alone consumer loan stores in that country. Total revenues from consumer loan and credit services operations accounted for approximately 3% of total revenues in 2018.
The Company offers fee-based credit services organization programs (“CSO Programs”) to assist consumers in obtaining extensions of credit. The Company’s stand-alone consumer loan stores and select pawn stores in the states of Texas and Ohio offer the CSO Programs. The Company’s CSO Programs comply with the respective jurisdiction’s credit services organization act, credit access business law or a similar statute. Under the CSO Programs, the Company assists customers in applying for a short-term extension of credit from independent, non-bank, consumer lending companies (the “Independent Lenders”) and issues the Independent Lenders a guarantee for the repayment of the extension of credit. The Company also offers an automobile title lending product under the CSO Programs. Credit services fees accounted for 1% of the Company’s revenue during fiscal 2018.
The Company also offers small, unsecured consumer loans to customers in various states within the U.S. To qualify for a consumer loan, a customer generally must have proof of steady income, residence and valid identification. At maturity, the loan and related fee is repaid by the customer with cash at the store or through a pre-authorized automated clearing house (“ACH”) transaction. If the customer fails to repay the loan or the ACH transaction is returned, the Company initiates collection procedures. Consumer loan fees accounted for 2% of the Company’s revenue during fiscal 2018.
On July 30, 2018, the governor of Ohio signed into law the Ohio Fairness in Lending Act (the “Ohio Act”) which will significantly impact the consumer loan industry in Ohio. See “Governmental Regulation” for further information about the Act and its potential impact on the Company’s results of operations.

Franchise Operations
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 62 unconsolidated franchised check cashing locations in the U.S. operating under the “Mr. Payroll” brand. Each of the Company’s unconsolidated franchised check cashing locations is subject to a franchise agreement negotiated individually with each franchisee and has varying durations. The Company receives franchise fees from each franchisee based on the gross revenue of check cashing services provided within the franchisee’s facility. 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 221 unconsolidated franchised pawn locations in Mexico operating under the “Prendamex” brand. Each of the Company’s unconsolidated franchised pawn locations is subject to a franchise agreement negotiated individually with each franchisee and has varying durations. The Company receives franchise fees from each franchisee based on pawn loan and inventory balances of the franchised stores. 
Total revenue from franchise fees accounted for less than 1% of consolidated total revenue during fiscal 2018.
Locations and Operations
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 2,473 store locations composed of 1,094 stores in 24 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, 1,323 stores in all 32 states in Mexico, 39 stores in Guatemala, 13 stores in El Salvador and four stores in Colombia.

Pawn Store Operations
The typical Company large-format pawn store is a freestanding building or part of a retail shopping center with adequate, well-lit parking. The Company also operates smaller stores in Mexico in urban markets which may not have parking. Management has established a standard store design intended to distinguish the Company’s stores from the competition. The design consists of a well-illuminated exterior with distinctive signage and a layout similar to other contemporary specialty retailers. The Company’s stores are typically open six or seven days a week from 9:00 a.m. to between 6:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.
The Company attempts to attract customers primarily through the pawn stores’ visibility and neighborhood presence. The Company uses seasonal promotions, special discounts for regular customers, prominent display of impulse purchase items such as consumer electronics, jewelry and tools, tent and sidewalk sales, and a layaway purchasing plan to attract retail shoppers. The Company attempts to attract and retain pawn customers by lending a competitive percentage of the estimated sales value of items presented for pledge and by providing quick financing, renewal and redemption services in an appealing atmosphere.
Generally, each pawnshop employs a manager, one or two assistant managers, and between one and eight sales personnel, depending upon the size, sales volume and location of the store. The store manager is responsible for customer relations, reviewing pawn transactions and related collateral, inventory management, supervising personnel and assuring the store is managed in accordance with Company guidelines and established policies and procedures which emphasize safeguarding of Company assets, strict cost containment and financial controls. All store personnel are expected to monitor expenses to contain costs. All material invoices are paid from Company headquarters in order to enhance financial accountability. The Company believes careful monitoring of customer transaction metrics and operational expenses enables it to maintain financial stability and profitability.
Each store manager reports to a district manager, who typically oversees four to seven store managers. District managers typically report to a regional manager who, in turn, typically reports to a regional operations director. Regional operations directors report to a regional vice president of operations. There are four regional vice presidents of operations and a senior vice president of operations who report to the chief operating officer.
The Company believes the profitability of its pawnshops is dependent, among other factors, upon its employees’ ability to engage with customers and provide prompt and courteous service. The Company’s proprietary computer system tracks certain key transactional performance measures including pawn loan yields and merchandise sales margins and permits a store manager or clerk to rapidly recall the cost of an item in inventory and the date it was purchased, as well as the prior transaction history of a particular customer. It also facilitates the timely valuation of goods by showing values assigned to similar goods. The Company has networked its stores to allow employees to more accurately determine the retail value of merchandise and to permit the Company’s headquarters to more efficiently monitor each store’s operations, including merchandise sales, service charge revenue, pawn loans written and redeemed and changes in inventory. 
The Company trains its employees through direct instruction and on-the-job pawn and sales experience. New employees are introduced to the business through an orientation and training program that includes on-the-job training in lending practices, layaways, merchandise valuation and general administration of store operations. Certain experienced employees receive training and an introduction to the fundamentals of management to acquire the skills necessary to advance into management positions within the organization. Management training typically involves exposure to income maximization, recruitment, inventory control and cost efficiency. The Company maintains a performance-based profit sharing compensation plan for all store employees based on sales, gross profit and other performance criteria. 
Credit Services and Consumer Loan Operations
Similar to the Company’s pawn store operations, the Company’s credit services and consumer loan locations are typically part of a retail strip shopping center with good visibility from a major street and easy access to parking. Management has established a standard store design intended to distinguish the Company’s stores from the competition, which consists of a well-illuminated exterior with distinctive signage. The interiors typically feature an ample lobby separated from employee work areas by glass teller windows. The Company’s credit services and consumer loan locations typically have hours similar to the Company’s pawn stores. The Company does not have any online credit services or consumer loan operations.

Environmental Sustainability and Social Responsibility
The Company is committed to sustainability and to operating its business in a manner that results in a positive impact on its employees, communities and the environment. 
Pawnshops are neighborhood-based stores which contribute to the modern “circular economy.” Each of the Company’s 2,456 pawn locations provides a quick and convenient source of small, non-recourse consumer loans and a neighborhood-based market for consumers to buy and resell popular consumer products in a safe environment. Virtually all collateral and inventory is pre-owned merchandise which is sourced and then recycled within each store’s geographic neighborhood. Unlike most retailers, the Company does not rely on manufacturing its inventories nor does it source any material volume of inventories from third party manufacturers or wholesalers. Accordingly, the Company does not own, operate or contract for any manufacturing, warehousing or distribution facilities which directly support the retail operations and, other than operating small store front locations of typically 5,000 square feet or less, the Company has virtually no carbon footprint related to its operations.
The Company also contributes to its communities by providing customers with instant access to capital through small non-recourse pawn loans or buying merchandise from its customers. Pawn loans can be quickly and easily accessed by customers who often have limited access to traditional credit products. Pawn loans are highly regulated, safe and affordable non-recourse loans for which the customer has no legal obligation to repay. The Company does not attempt to collect on delinquent loans, does not take legal actions against its customers, does not blacklist its customers, nor does it issue any negative external credit reporting, but rather relies only on the resale of the pawn collateral for recovery. 
The Company has over 19,000 employees across five countries (the U.S., Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Colombia). It is committed to creating a safe, trusted and diverse environment in which its employees can thrive. Its employees’ wages are typically well above minimum wage standards in each country in which it operates. It also provides its employees with extensive training and advancement opportunities, demonstrated by its long track record of employee advancement and promotion from within the organization. The Company maintains a robust know your customer, anti-money laundering and anti-bribery training program and requires its locations to adhere to a labor compliance program that meets or exceeds the standards established for coercion and harassment, discrimination and restrictions to freedom of association. The Company’s locations provide a safe, comfortable and healthy work environment and maintain compliance with all occupational safety, wage and hour laws and other workplace regulations. 
The Company values diversity at all levels of its organization. In the U.S., approximately 68% of all employees are ethnically diverse, and in total, approximately 87% of all employees are ethnically diverse. The Company’s store management employee population, in particular, exhibits a high level of female and ethnic diversity, with approximately 54% being female and approximately 90% being either female and/or ethnically diverse. 
The Company also believes in fairly compensating its employees and providing them with an ability to share in the Company’s profitability. For example, the majority of the Company’s front-line employees participate in a non-qualified profit sharing program which pays up to 8% of the gross profit they personally participate in through customer service activities. 
Competition
The Company encounters significant competition in connection with all aspects of its business operations. These competitive conditions may adversely affect the Company’s revenue, profitability and ability to expand. The Company believes the primary elements of competition in the businesses in which it operates are store location, customer service, the ability to lend competitive amounts on pawn loans and to sell popular retail merchandise at competitive prices. In addition, the Company competes with other lenders and retailers to attract, motivate and retain employees with competitive compensation programs. 
The Company’s pawn business competes primarily with other pawn store operators, other specialty consumer finance operators, rent-to-own stores and specialty consumer goods retailers. Management believes the pawn industry remains highly fragmented with an estimated 12,000 to 14,000 total pawnshops in the U.S. and 7,000 to 8,000 pawnshops in Mexico. Including the Company, there are two publicly-held, U.S.-based pawnshop operators, both of which have pawn operations in the U.S., Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador. Of these two, the Company had the most pawn stores and the largest market capitalization as of December 31, 2018, and believes it is the largest public or private operator of large format, full-service pawn stores in the U.S. and Mexico. The pawnshop and other specialty consumer finance industries are characterized by a large number of independent owner-operators, some of whom own and operate multiple locations. In addition, the Company competes with other non-pawn lenders, such as banks and consumer finance companies, which generally lend on an unsecured as well as a secured basis. Other lenders may and do lend money on terms more favorable than those offered by the Company. Many of these financial institutions have greater financial resources than the Company’s with which to compete for consumer loans.

In both its U.S. and Latin American retail pawn operations, the Company’s competitors include numerous retail and wholesale merchants, including jewelry stores, rent-to-own stores, discount retail stores, “second-hand” stores, consumer electronics stores, other specialty retailers, online retailers, online auction sites, online classified advertising sites and other pawnshops. Competitive factors in the Company’s retail operations include the ability to provide the customer with a variety of merchandise items at attractive prices. Many of the retail competitors have significantly greater size and financial resources than the Company.
Intellectual Property 
The Company relies on a combination of trademarks, trade secrets, proprietary software, website domain names and other rights, including confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. 
The Company’s competitors may develop products that are similar to its technology, such as the Company’s proprietary point of sale software. The Company enters into agreements with its employees, consultants and partners, and through these and other written agreements, the Company attempts to control access to and distribution of its software, documentation and other proprietary technology and information. Despite the Company’s efforts to protect its proprietary rights, third parties may, in an authorized or unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute its intellectual property rights or technology or otherwise develop a product with the same functionality as its solution. Policing all unauthorized use of the Company’s intellectual property rights is nearly impossible. The Company cannot be certain that the steps it has taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriations of its technology or intellectual property rights. 
“First Cash Pawn,” “Cash America” and “Cashland” are trademarks owned by the Company registered in the U.S. “FirstCash,” “First Cash,” “First Cash Empeño y Joyeria,” “Cash Ya,” “Cash & Go,” “CA,” “Cash America,” “Presta Max,” “Realice Empeños,” “Empeños Mexicanos” and “Maxi Prenda” are trademarks owned by the Company registered in the respective Latin American countries. Prendamex is a registered trademark in Mexico for which the Company has a contractual right to use. Other significant trade names used by the Company in the U.S. and abroad include First Cash Advance, Famous Pawn, Fast Cash Pawn & Gold Center, King Pawn, Mister Money Pawn, Money Man Pawn, Valu + Pawn, Dan’s Discount Jewelry & Pawn, Quick Cash Pawn, Atomic Pawn, Loftis Jewelry & Pawnbrokers, Regent Pawn & Jewelry, Smart Pawn, Piazza Jewelry & Pawn, David’s Pawn Shop, Sharp Mart, Lakelands Pawn & Gun, SuperPawn, Mr. Payroll and Cash Plus Pawn.
Governmental Regulation 
General
The Company is subject to significant regulation of its pawn, consumer loan and general business operations in all of the jurisdictions in which it operates. These regulations are implemented through various laws, ordinances and regulatory pronouncements from federal, state and municipal governmental entities in the U.S. and Latin America. These regulatory bodies often have broad discretionary authority over the establishment, interpretation and enforcement of such regulations. These regulations are subject to change, sometimes significantly, as a result of political, economic or social trends, events and media perception.
The Company is subject to specific laws, regulations and ordinances primarily concerning its pawn and consumer lending operations. Many statutes and regulations prescribe, among other things, the general terms of the Company’s pawn and consumer loan agreements, including maximum service fees and/or interest rates that may be charged and collected and mandatory consumer disclosures. In many municipal, state and federal jurisdictions, in both the U.S. and countries in Latin America, the Company must obtain and maintain regulatory store operating and employee licenses and comply with regular or frequent regulatory reporting and registration requirements, including reporting and recording of pawn loans, pawned collateral, used merchandise purchased from the general public, retail sales activities, firearm transactions, export, import and transfer of merchandise, and currency transactions, among other things.
In both the U.S. and Latin America, certain elected officials, regulators, consumer advocacy groups and the media have advocated for governmental action to further restrict or even prohibit pawn transactions or small consumer loans, such as payday advances and credit services products. Such advocates often characterize pawn and payday lending activities as unfair or potentially abusive to consumers and typically focus on the aggregate fees charged to a consumer for pawn and consumer loans, which are typically higher than the interest rate generally charged by banks, credit unions and credit card issuers to consumers with established or higher-rated credit. They also focus on affordability issues such as the borrower’s ability to repay such loans, real or perceived patterns of sustained or cyclical usage of such lending products and consumer loan collection practices perceived to be unfair or abusive. During the last few years, legislation, ordinances and edicts at federal, state and municipal levels have been introduced or enacted to prohibit, restrict or further regulate pawn and related transactions, including acceptance of pawn collateral and used merchandise in general or, from certain individuals, sales of such merchandise in general or specific categories such as firearms, 
11

payday loans, consumer loans, credit services and related service fees on these products. In addition, public officials and regulatory authorities, including law enforcement in various levels of government in the U.S. and countries in Latin America have and will likely continue to make edicts, proposals or public statements concerning new or expanded regulations that would prohibit or further restrict pawn and consumer lending activities or other related pawn transactions.
The Company is subject to numerous other types of regulations including, but not limited to, regulations related to securities and exchange activities, including financial reporting and internal controls processes, data protection and privacy, tax compliance, health and safety, labor and employment practices, import/export activities, real estate transactions, electronic banking, credit card transactions, marketing, advertising and other general business activities.
There can be no assurance that the current political domestic and international climate will not change and negatively affect the Company’s business, or that additional local, state or federal statutes, regulations or edicts will not be enacted or that existing laws and regulations will not be amended, decreed or interpreted at some future date that could prohibit or limit the ability of the Company to profitably operate any or all of its services. For example, such regulations could restrict the ability of the Company to offer pawn loans, consumer loans and credit services, significantly decrease the interest rates or service fees for such lending activities, prohibit or more stringently regulate the acceptance of pawn collateral or buying used merchandise and the sale, exportation or importation of such pawn merchandise, or processing of consumer loan transactions through the banking system, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial condition. If legislative, regulatory or other arbitrary actions or interpretations are taken at a federal, state or local level in the U.S. or countries in Latin America which negatively affect the pawn, consumer loan or credit services industries where the Company has a concentrated or significant number of stores, those actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business operations. There can be no assurance that such regulatory action at any jurisdiction level will not be enacted, or that existing laws and regulations will not be amended, decreed or interpreted in such a way which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial condition.
U.S. Federal Regulations
The U.S. government and its agencies have significant regulatory authority over consumer financial services activities. In recent years, additional legislation and regulations have been enacted or proposed which has increased or could continue to increase regulation of the consumer finance industry. These regulations and restrictions are or may be specific to pawn, credit services and consumer loan operations.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), created by Title X of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), has broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers over certain financial institutions. Specifically, it has enforcement authority over all organizations the CFPB deems may create the potential for consumer harm or risk. The CFPB’s powers include explicit supervisory authority to examine and require registration of providers of consumer financial products and services, including providers of secured and unsecured consumer loans, such as the Company, the authority to adopt rules describing specified acts and practices as being “unfair,” “deceptive,” “abusive” and hence “unlawful,” and the authority to impose recordkeeping obligations and promulgate additional compliance requirements. 
Over the years, the CFPB has systematically gathered data related to all aspects of the consumer loan industry and its impact on consumers and continues to use its Short-Term, Small-Dollar Lending Procedures, the field guide its examiners use when examining small-dollar lenders like the Company. The CFPB’s examination authority permits examiners to inspect the Company’s books and records and ask questions about its business and its practices relating to unsecured, small dollar loans, like payday loans. The examination procedures include, among other things, specific modules for examining marketing activities, loan application and origination activities, payment processing activities and sustained use by consumers, collections and collection practices, defaults, consumer reporting and third-party or vendor relationships. 
In addition to the Dodd-Frank Act’s grant of regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement powers to the CFPB, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to pursue administrative proceedings or litigation for actual or perceived violations of federal consumer laws (including the CFPB’s own rules). In these proceedings, the CFPB can seek consent orders, confidential memorandums of understandings, obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for redisclosure, restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as affirmative or injunctive relief) and monetary penalties ranging from $5,000 per day for certain violations of federal consumer laws to $25,000 per day for reckless violations, and $1,000,000 per day for knowing or intentional violations. Also, where a company has been found to have violated consumer laws, the Dodd-Frank Act (in addition to similar state consumer laws) empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring administrative or civil actions seeking the same equitable relief available to the CFPB, in addition to state-led enforcement actions and consent orders. If the CFPB or one or more state officials believe that the Company has violated any of the applicable laws or regulations, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its business.
12

On October 5, 2017, the CFPB released its small-dollar loan rule (the “SDL Rule”), however it has yet to take practical effect since, in early 2018, the CFPB announced its intention to “reconsider” the SDL Rule in January 2019, and in early December 2018, a judge in the 5th Circuit stayed the SDL Rule in a case filed by trade groups, which effectively put the compliance date for this rule on hold until further order by the court. While the SDL Rule has technically been finalized, it is still not certain whether it will take effect, and to what extent it will impact the Company. If the SDL Rule takes effect as currently written, lenders, like the Company, will likely be required, among other things, to determine whether consumers have the ability to repay their loans before issuing certain short-term small dollar, payday and auto title loans, obtain verification from the consumer of certain debts and verification through outside sources by lenders of certain debts, implement mandatory cooling off periods and increase restrictions on collection practices. The SDL Rule defines the Company’s consumer loan products, both short-term loans, and installment loans, as loans covered under the rule. However, the Company believes the SDL Rule (even in its current form) will not directly impact the vast majority of its pawn products, which comprise approximately 97% of its total revenues. On a consolidated basis, the Company expects consumer loan revenue for the year ending December 31, 2019 to account for less than 2% of the Company’s consolidated total revenue. If the SDL Rule remains effective in its current form, the small dollar lending industry will experience a significant regulatory change. 
In July 2015, the U.S. Department of Defense published a finalized set of additional requirements and restrictions under the Military Lending Act (“MLA Rule”). The MLA Rule, which went into effect on October 3, 2016, amended requirements for its “safe harbor” (making covered member attestation insufficient on its own to comply with the “safe harbor” provision of the MLA Rule) and expanded the scope of the credit products covered by the MLA to include overdraft lines of credit, pawn loans, or vehicle and certain unsecured installment loan products to the extent any such products have a military annual percentage rate greater than 36%. While the Company does not believe that active members of the U.S. military or their dependents comprise a significant percentage of the historical customer base in most locations, compliance with the MLA Rule, including its safe harbor provisions, is complex, increases compliance risks and related costs and limits the potential customer base of the Company.
In addition to the federal laws and frameworks already governing the financial industry, the U.S. Justice Department (“DOJ” or “Department of Justice”), in conjunction with federal banking regulators, began an initiative in 2013 (“Operation Choke Point”) directed at banks in the U.S. that do business with payment processors, payday lenders, pawn operators and other companies believed to be at higher risk for fraud and money laundering. It is believed the intent of this initiative was to restrict the ability of banks to provide financial services to companies in the targeted industries. In January 2015, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) issued a publication encouraging banks to take a risk-based approach in assessing individual customer relationships, rather than declining to provide banking services to entire categories of customers without regard to the risks presented by an individual customer or the financial institution’s ability to manage the risk. Further, in August 2017, the Department of Justice informed lawmakers that Operation Choke Point was no longer in effect. Nevertheless, the Company continues to experience difficulty in securing new banking services and maintaining existing banking services in certain markets. There can be no assurance that Operation Choke Point and its subsequent effects will not pose a further or stigmatized threat to the Company’s ability to access credit, maintain bank accounts and treasury services, process payday lending transactions or obtain other banking services needed to operate efficiently and profitably. 
In connection with pawn transactions and credit services/consumer loan transactions, the Company must comply with various disclosure requirements under the Federal Truth in Lending Act (and Federal Reserve Regulation Z promulgated thereunder). These disclosures include, among other things, the total amount of the finance charges and annualized percentage rate of the charges associated with pawn transactions, consumer loan and credit services transactions.
The credit services/consumer loan business is also subject to various laws, rules and guidelines relating to the procedures and disclosures needed for debiting a debtor’s checking account for amounts due via an ACH transaction. Additionally, the Company may be subject to certain portions of other laws such as the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and applicable state collection laws when conducting its collection activities related to its unsecured small dollar loans, depending on the product or service. 
Under the Bank Secrecy Act, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury Department”) regulates transactions involving currency in an amount greater than $10,000. Additionally, the purchase of monetary instruments for cash in amounts from $3,000 to $10,000 must be recorded, however, the Company no longer offers these transactions. In general, and depending on the service or product, financial institutions, including the Company, must report each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of currency or other payment or transfer, whether by, through or to the financial institution, that involves currency in an amount greater than $10,000 during a specific period. In addition, multiple related currency transactions must be treated as single transactions if the financial institution has knowledge that the transactions are by, or on behalf of, any one person and result in either cash in or cash out totaling more than $10,000 during any one business day or over a certain time period.
13

Under the USA PATRIOT Act passed by Congress in 2001 and revised in 2006, the Company is subject to certain anti-money laundering laws dependent on the products and services offered. Beginning on January 1, 2018, the Company ceased to offer fee-based check cashing services in its non-franchise stores and no longer considers itself a money services business as defined under U.S. federal law. As a result, the Company is no longer subject to anti-money laundering requirements under U.S. federal laws pertaining to money services businesses.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires the Company to generally protect the confidentiality of its customers’ nonpublic personal information and to disclose to its customers its privacy policy and practices, including those regarding sharing the customers’ nonpublic personal information with third parties. Such disclosure must be made to customers at the time the customer relationship is established, at least annually thereafter, and if there is a change in the Company’s privacy policy. In addition, the Company is subject to strict document retention and destruction policies.
The federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”) prohibits discrimination against any credit applicant on the basis of any protected category, such as race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age, and requires the Company to notify credit applicants of the Company’s consumer loan products of any action taken on the individual’s credit application. The Company must provide a loan applicant a Notice of Adverse Action (“NOAA”) when the Company denies an application for credit related to its unsecured consumer loan products. The NOAA must inform the applicant of (1) the action taken regarding the credit application, (2) a statement of the ECOA’s prohibition on discrimination, (3) the name and address of both the creditor and the federal agency that monitors compliance with the ECOA, and (4) the applicant’s right to learn the specific reasons for the denial of credit and the contact information for the parties the applicant can contact to obtain those reasons. The Company provides NOAA letters and maintains records of all such letters as required by the ECOA and its regulations.
The Company’s unsecured consumer loan products also may be subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (regulation V), which requires the Company to provide certain information to customers when credit information is provided by a reporting agency and used in issuing credit to a customer or to respond to customers who dispute an inaccuracy regarding the reporting of their information. 
The Company’s advertising and marketing activities, in general and depending on the type of product and/or service offered, are subject to additional federal laws and regulations administered by the Federal Trade Commission and the CFPB which prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices and false or misleading advertisements. 
The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (“FACTA”) requires the Company to adopt written guidance and procedures for detecting, mitigating, preventing and responding appropriately to identity theft and to adopt various employee policies, procedures, and provide employee training and materials that address the importance of protecting nonpublic personal information, specifically, personal identifiable information, and aid the Company in detecting and responding to suspicious activity, including suspicious activity which may suggest a possible identity theft red flag, as appropriate.
The Company is subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other similar laws in other jurisdictions that prohibit improper payments or offers of improper payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers (as defined by the statute) for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, the FCPA requires adequate accounting internal controls and record keeping. It is the Company’s policy to maintain safeguards to discourage these practices by its employees and vendors and follow Company standards of conduct for its business throughout the U.S. and Latin America, including the prohibition of any direct or indirect payment or transfer of Company funds or assets to suppliers, vendors, or government officials in the form of bribes, kickbacks or other illegal payoffs.
Each pawn store location that handles pawned firearms or buys and sells firearms must comply with the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (the “Brady Act”). The Brady Act requires that federally licensed firearms dealers conduct a background check in connection with releasing, selling or otherwise disposing of firearms. In addition, the Company must also comply with various state law provisions and the regulations of the U.S. Department of Justice-Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that require each pawn lending location dealing in guns to obtain a Federal Firearm License (“FFL”) and maintain a permanent written record of all receipts and dispositions of firearms. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 714 locations in the U.S. with an active FFL.

U.S. State and Local Regulations
The Company operates pawn stores in 24 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, all of which have licensing and/or fee regulations on pawnshop operations and employees. In general, state statutes and regulations establish licensing requirements for pawnbrokers and may regulate various aspects of pawn transactions, including the purchase and sale of merchandise, service charges, interest rates, the content and form of the pawn transaction agreement and the length of time a pawnbroker must hold a purchased item or forfeited pawn before it is made available for sale. Additionally, these statutes and regulations in various jurisdictions restrict or prohibit the Company from transferring and/or relocating its pawn licenses and restrict or prohibit the issuance of new licenses. The Company’s fee structures are at or below the applicable rate ceilings adopted by each of these states. The Company offers its pawn and retail customers an interest free layaway plan which complies with applicable state laws. In addition, the Company is in compliance with the net asset requirements in states where it is required to maintain certain levels of liquid assets for each pawn store it operates in the applicable state. Failure to observe a state’s legal requirements for pawn brokering could result, among other things, in loss of pawn licenses, fines, refunds, and other civil or criminal proceedings. 
Many of the Company’s pawn locations are also subject to local ordinances that require, among other things, local permits, licenses, record keeping requirements and procedures, reporting of daily transactions, and adherence to local law enforcement “do not buy lists” by checking law enforcement created databases. Specifically, under some county and municipal ordinances, pawn stores must provide local law enforcement agencies with reports of all daily transactions involving pawns and over-the-counter merchandise purchased directly from customers. These daily transaction reports are designed to provide local law enforcement officials with a detailed description of the merchandise involved, including serial numbers, if any, or other specific identifying information, including the name and address of the customer obtained from a valid identification card and photographs of the customers and/or merchandise in certain jurisdictions. Goods held to secure pawns or goods directly purchased may be subject to mandatory holding periods before they can be resold by the Company. If pawned or purchased merchandise is determined to belong to an owner other than the borrower or seller, it may be subject to confiscation by police for recovery by the rightful owners. Historically, the Company has not found the volume of the confiscations or claims to have a material adverse effect upon results of operations. The Company does not maintain insurance to cover the costs of returning merchandise to its rightful owners but historically has benefited from civil and criminal restitution efforts.
The Company operates its consumer loan business in seven states which are regulated under a variety of enabling state statutes and subject to various local rules, regulations and ordinances. The scope of these regulations, including the fees and terms of the Company’s consumer loan products and services, varies by state, county and city. These laws generally define the services that the Company can provide to consumers and require the Company to provide a contract to the customer outlining the Company’s services and the cost of those services to the customer. During fiscal 2018, the Company’s consumer loan and credit services fee revenue represented approximately 3% of the Company’s overall revenues.
The states with laws that specifically regulate the Company’s unsecured consumer loan products and services typically limit the principal amount of a consumer loan and set maximum fees or interest rates that customers may be charged. Most states also limit a customer’s ability to renew a short-term consumer loan and require various disclosures to consumers. State statutes often specify minimum and maximum maturity dates for consumer loans and, in some cases specifically related to unsecured loans, specify mandatory cooling-off periods between transactions. The Company’s collection activities regarding past due amounts on its unsecured, small dollar loans, are subject to consumer protection laws and state regulations relating to debt collection practices. Also, some states require the Company to report loan activity to state-wide databases and restrict the number and/or principal amount of loans a consumer may have outstanding at any particular time or over the course of a particular period of time, typically twelve months. In addition, these laws may require additional disclosures to consumers and may require the Company to be registered with the jurisdiction and/or be bonded.
As a credit services organization in Texas and Ohio, the Company assists customers in applying for a short-term, unsecured extension of credit from the Independent Lenders and issues the Independent Lenders a guarantee for the repayment of the extension of credit. When a consumer executes a credit services agreement with the Company, the customer agrees to pay a fee to the Company if the Independent Lenders approve the extension of credit, and the Company agrees to guarantee the customer’s obligation to repay the extension of credit received by the customer from the Independent Lenders if the customer fails to do so. The credit services organization must give a consumer the right to cancel the credit services agreement without penalty for three days after the agreement is signed. In addition, credit services locations generally must be registered as a credit services organization and are subject to various other jurisdictional regulations and requirements.
On July 30, 2018, the governor of Ohio signed into law the Ohio Act. The Ohio Act will significantly impact the consumer loan industry in Ohio, as it effectively caps a consumer loan amount at $1,000, substantially limits consumer loans with maturities of less than 90 days by capping monthly payments as a percentage of the borrower’s gross income, creates a maximum loan term of one year, caps interest rates at 28% per annum and caps the total cost of a consumer loan (including fees) at 60% of the original 
15

principal. There are also other provisions such as disclosure requirements, maximum borrowing levels and collections restrictions. In addition, the Ohio Act essentially eliminates the use of credit service organizations (each a “CSO”) by prohibiting a CSO from brokering loans that meet any of the following conditions: (1) the loan amount is less than $5,000, (2) the term of the loan is one year or less, and (3) the annual percentage rate exceeds 28%. The provisions of the Ohio Act went into effect on October 29, 2018, but will not apply to loans made and credit extensions obtained until April 27, 2019.
The Company currently operates 113 Cashland-branded stores in Ohio that primarily offer consumer loan and credit services products, which are likely to be negatively impacted by the Ohio Act in 2019. The Company also operates six pawn stores in Ohio that also offer consumer loan and credit services products as ancillary products and would be much less impacted. The Company’s Ohio operations generated consumer lending and credit services revenues and net revenues in 2018 of $41.7 million and $28.6 million, respectively, representing 2.3% and 3.0% of the Company’s consolidated revenue and net revenue, respectively. In addition, the Cashland stores generated $36.8 million in gross pawn related revenues and $18.8 million in net pawn related revenues. The Company will continue to analyze the impact of the Ohio Act, including potential replacement products, affecting the viability of its Cashland operations in Ohio after the provisions of the law become effective in April 2019. While most of the Cashland stores also offer pawn products that will enable many of them to continue to operate profitably, the Company anticipates the expected decrease in consumer lending revenue after the Ohio Act becomes effective could cause one-third or more of the stores to become unprofitable and potentially subject to closing. 
Local rules, regulations and ordinances vary widely from county to county or city to city. While many of the local rules and regulations relate primarily to zoning and land use restrictions, certain cities have restrictive regulations specific to pawn and consumer loan products. Additionally, local jurisdictions’ efforts to regulate or restrict the terms of pawn, consumer loan and credit services products will likely continue to increase. 
It is expected that additional legislation and/or regulations relating to pawn transactions, credit services, installment loans and other consumer loan products will be proposed in several state legislatures and/or city councils where the Company has pawn, unsecured consumer loan products and credit services operations. Though the Company cannot accurately predict the scope, extent and nature of future regulations, it is likely that such legislation may address the maximum allowable interest rates on loans, significantly restrict the ability of customers to obtain such loans by limiting the maximum number of consecutive loan transactions that may be provided to a customer, and/or limiting the total loans a customer may have outstanding at any point in time. Any or all of these changes could make offering these products less profitable and could restrict or even eliminate the availability of consumer loan, pawn transactions and credit services products in some or all of the states or localities in which the Company offers such products.
Many local government entities prohibit or restrict pawn and other consumer finance and check cashing activities through zoning ordinances, which can significantly limit the ability of the Company to move, expand, remodel or relocate store locations, and in some cases cause existing stores to be closed. Consequently, the Company has de-emphasized its unsecured, consumer loan business over the last few years and will likely continue to do so in the future, and beginning in fiscal 2018, the Company no longer offers fee-based check cashing services in its non-franchised stores.
The Company cannot currently assess the likelihood of any other proposed legislation, regulations or amendments, such as those described above or discussed in “Item 1A, Risk Factors,” which could be enacted. However, if such legislation or regulations were enacted in certain jurisdictions, it could have a materially adverse impact on the revenue and profitability of the Company.
Mexico Federal Regulations
Federal law in Mexico provides for administrative regulation of the pawnshop industry by Procuraduria Federal del Consumidor (“PROFECO”), Mexico’s primary federal consumer protection agency, which requires the Company to annually register its pawn stores, approve pawn contracts and disclose the interest rate and fees charged on pawn transactions. In addition, the pawnshop industry in Mexico is subject to various general business regulations in the areas of tax compliance, customs, consumer protections, anti-money laundering, public safety and employment matters, among others, by various federal, state and local governmental agencies.
PROFECO regulates the form and non-financial terms of pawn contracts and defines certain operating standards and procedures for pawnshops, including retail operations, consumer disclosures and establishes reporting requirements and requires all pawn businesses and its owners to register annually with and be approved by PROFECO in order to legally operate. In addition, all operators must comply with additional customer notice and disclosure provisions, bonding requirements to insure against loss or insolvency, reporting of certain types of suspicious transactions, and reporting to state law enforcement officials of certain transactions (or series of transactions) or suspicious transactions on a monthly basis to states’ attorneys general offices. PROFECO continues to modify its process and procedures regarding its annual registration requirements and the Company has complied and 
16

complies in all material respects with this process and registration requirements as administered by PROFECO. There are significant fines and sanctions, including operating suspensions for failure to register and/or comply with PROFECO’s rules and regulations. 

Mexico’s anti-money laundering regulations, The Federal Law for the Prevention and Identification of Transactions with Funds From Illegal Sources (“Anti-Money Laundering Law”), requires monthly reporting of certain transactions (or series of transactions) exceeding certain monetary limits, imposes strict maintenance of customer identification records and controls and requires reporting of all foreign (non-Mexican) customer transactions. This law affects all industries in Mexico and is intended to detect commercial activities arising from illicit or ill-gotten means though bilateral cooperation between Mexico’s Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (“Hacienda”), and all of Mexico’s various states’ attorneys general offices (“PGR”). This law restricts the use of cash in certain transactions associated with high-value assets and limits, to the extent possible, money laundering activities protected by the anonymity that cash transactions provide. The law empowers Hacienda to oversee and enforce these regulations and to follow up on the information received from other agencies in Mexico and abroad. Relevant aspects of the law specifically affecting the pawn industry include monthly reporting by the Company to Hacienda and the PGR on “vulnerable activities,” which encompass the sale of jewelry, precious metals and watches exceeding $64,883 Mexican pesos, individually, and retail and pawn transactions (of cash or credit) exceeding $129,363 Mexican pesos, in aggregate. There are significant fines and sanctions for failure to comply with the Anti-Money Laundering Law.
Mexico’s Federal Personal Information Protection Act (“Mexico Privacy Law”) requires companies to protect their customers’ personal information, among other things. Specifically, the Mexico Privacy Law requires that the Company create and maintain a privacy policy and inform its customers whether the Company shares the customer’s personal information with third parties or transfers personal information to third parties. It also requires public posting (both on-line and in-store) of the Company’s privacy policy, which includes a process for the customer to revoke any previous consent granted to the Company for the use of the customer’s personal information, or limit the use or disclosure of such information.
Mexico State and Local Regulations
Certain state and local governmental entities in Mexico also regulate pawn, other consumer finance and retail businesses through state laws and local zoning and permitting ordinances. For example, in certain states where the Company has significant or concentrated operations, states have enacted legislation or implemented regulations which require items such as special state operating permits for pawn stores, certification of pawn employees trained in valuation of merchandise, strict customer identification controls, collateral ownership certifications and/or detailed and specified transactional reporting of customers and operations. Certain other states have proposed similar legislation but have not yet enacted such legislation. Additionally, certain municipalities in Mexico have attempted to curtail the operation of new and existing pawn stores through additional local business licensing, permitting and reporting requirements. State and local agencies, including local and state police officials, often have unlimited and discretionary authority to suspend store operations pending an investigation of suspicious pawn transactions or resolution of actual or alleged regulatory, licensing and permitting issues.
Other Latin American Federal and Local Regulations
Similar to Mexico, certain federal, department and local governmental entities in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Colombia also regulate the pawn industry and retail and commercial businesses. Certain federal laws and local zoning and permitting ordinances require basic commercial business licenses and signage permits. Operating in these countries also subjects the Company to other types of regulations including, but not limited to, regulations related to commercialization of merchandise, financial reporting, privacy and data protection, tax compliance, customs, labor and employment practices, real estate transactions, anti-money laundering, commercial and electronic banking restrictions, credit card transactions, marketing, advertising and other general business activities. Like Mexico, department agencies, including local and state police officials have unlimited and discretionary authority in their application of their rules and requirements. 
As the scope of the Company’s international operations increases, the Company may face additional administrative and regulatory costs in operating and managing its business. In addition, unexpected changes, arbitrary or adverse court decisions, adverse action by financial regulators, aggressive public officials or regulators attacking the Company’s business models, administrative interpretations of federal or local requirements or legislation, or public remarks by elected officials could negatively impact the Company’s operations and profitability.

The Company employs approximately 19,000 employees as of December 31, 2018, including approximately 1,300 persons employed in executive, supervisory, administrative and accounting functions. None of the Company’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company considers its employee relations to be satisfactory.
