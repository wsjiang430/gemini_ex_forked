Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in this Annual Report, including in the sections entitled “Risk Factors,” Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business” constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the “Safe Harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Generally, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “project”, “outlook,” “target”, “may,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “seek,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “likely,” “goal,” “strategy,” “future,” “maintain,” and “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terms. Examples of forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K include, among others, statements we make regarding:

• | Future market conditions, including anticipated national new car sales levels;


• | Expected operating results, such as improved store performance; continued improvement of selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) as a percentage of gross profit and all projections;


• | Anticipated integration, success and growth of acquired stores;


• | Anticipated ability to capture additional market share;

Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and development of the industry in which we operate may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimated or projected results include, without limitation, the factors as discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, and in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and, from time to time, in our other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Annual Report is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.
Overview
Lithia Motors, Inc. is one of the largest automotive retailers and providers of personal transportation solutions in the United States, and in 2018 was ranked #294 on the Fortune 500. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 181 stores representing 28 brands in 18 states. We offer convenient, personalized service complemented by the reach and scale of a nationwide network, one of the largest online inventories and competitive pricing on vehicles and service. Our vision to create personal transportation solutions wherever, whenever and however consumers desire, combined with our mission, "Growth Powered by People," focuses us on our customers and our teams, creating our competitive advantage.
We offer a wide range of products and services including new and used vehicles, finance and insurance products and automotive repair and maintenance. We strive for diversification in our products, services, brands and geographic locations to reduce dependence on any one manufacturer, reduce susceptibility to changing consumer preferences, manage market risk and maintain profitability. As of December 31, 2018, we had three reportable segments: Domestic, Import and Luxury. For certain financial information by segment, see Notes 1 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Business Strategy 
Our values guide us in serving our customers, developing our people, reaching our potential and growing our Company. Our stores create a welcoming and highly-responsive environment to proactively engage customers wherever, whenever and however they desire. We strive to create an omni-channel retail experience that provides our customers with freedom, selection and choice throughout the ownership life cycle. 
We build long-term value for our customers, employees and shareholders through the following strategies:
Driving operational excellence and unlocking store potential
We remain focused on improving performance at existing locations. Operations are structured to promote an entrepreneurial environment at the dealership level. Each store’s general manager and department managers, with assistance from regional and corporate management, are responsible for developing successful retail plans in their local markets. They are responsible for driving dealership operations, personnel development, manufacturer relationships, store culture and financial performance. Strong performance creates synergistic benefits such as increased vehicle trade-ins resulting in additional used vehicle sales, incremental finance and insurance sales and ultimately, increased units in operation and customer retention, which generate additional service revenues.
In order to mitigate fluctuations in vehicle sales and general economic conditions, we link compensation to performance for the majority of our management and sales personnel. We develop pay plans that are measured based upon various factors such as dealership and department profitability, customer satisfaction and individual performance metrics. These plans also serve to reward personnel for meeting their annual operating plans and achieving store potential.
We have centralized many administrative functions to drive efficiencies and streamline store-level operations. The reduction of administrative functions at our stores allows our local managers to focus on customer-facing opportunities to increase revenues and gross profit. Our operations are supported by our dedicated training and personnel development program, which shares best practices across our dealership network and seeks to develop management talent. 
Growth through acquisition and network optimization
Our value-based acquisition strategy targets underperforming stores with strong franchises in desirable markets. As we integrate these stores into our existing network, we focus on improving performance. Our success is measured by achieving profitability 
3

through increasing market share and retaining customers while controlling costs. With our performance management strategy, standardized information systems and centrally- and regionally-performed administrative functions, we seek to gain economies of scale from our dealership network.
We target acquiring domestic, import and luxury franchises in cities ranging from mid-sized regional markets to metropolitan markets. We evaluate all brands for expansion opportunities provided the market is large enough to support adequate new vehicle sales to justify the required capital investment. During 2018, we acquired 17 stores, opened one store, de-dualed two stores and divested eight stores. We invested $253.8 million, net of floor plan debt, to acquire these stores and we expect these acquisitions to add over $1.2 billion in annual revenues. Additionally, these acquisitions allow us to maintain a diverse franchise mix and further leverage our cost structure. We focus on successfully integrating acquired stores to achieve targeted returns. Platform acquisitions may include one or more locations which do not meet our criteria. We regularly optimize and balance our network through strategic divestitures to ensure continued high performance. Approximately half of the divested stores during 2018 were from platform acquisitions. The divestiture of these underperforming stores increases availability of capital and personnel resources and reduces future capital expenditures for facility improvements. These divestitures generated approximately $34 million in proceeds and reduced forecasted capital expenditures by approximately $15 million to be redeployed for investment in growth and innovation. We believe our disciplined approach and the current economic environment provide us with attractive acquisition opportunities and expanded coast to coast coverage.
Innovation and diversification
Driving growth and achieving earnings potential generates the free cash flow that allows us to invest in innovation, diversification and digital initiatives, thereby providing more ways to meet consumers' personal transportation needs. Through innovation and technology, we strive to provide a personalized customer experience wherever, whenever and however consumers desire. During the third quarter of 2018, we entered into a strategic partnership with Shift Technologies, Inc. ("Shift"), a San Francisco-based digital retailer. Shift provides an innovative platform to consumers for a digital vehicle purchase and selling experience, providing vehicle pickup and delivery at the customer's location. We invested $54 million in Shift, leading the series D fundraising round and becoming its largest shareholder. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we collaborated with Shift in two areas, resulting in Lithia receiving additional equity ownership in Shift. In early October 2018, we assisted in Shift securing a credit line for acquiring used vehicle inventory and, in December 2018, we entered into a lease agreement to provide Shift with use of one of our retail locations for inventory storage and reconditioning. The strategic partnership with Shift will allow both companies to share and scale technology, data, inventory and business relationships, allowing us to capture more of the approximately 40 million used vehicles sold in the United States annually.
Thoughtful capital allocation
We constantly evaluate how to allocate capital, including returning cash to our investors and investing in our stores. During 2018, we paid $27.7 million in dividends, and spent $148.9 million to repurchase 2.1 million shares, or approximately 9% of total outstanding shares. We also invested in our facilities, allocating $158.0 million to capital expenditures. We continue to manage our liquidity and available cash to prepare for future acquisition and innovation opportunities. As of December 31, 2018, we had $211.2 million in available funds in cash and availability on our credit facilities, with an estimated additional $247.7 million available if we financed our unencumbered owned real estate.
Marketing
One of our core values is to create customer experiences so satisfying that we earn their business for life. To facilitate customer retention for service and repeat purchase, we design marketing strategies utilizing database analysis and multi-channel communications to anticipate, listen and respond to customer needs. We tailor each store's strategy to the individual store, market, brand and manufacturer partners.
We use a combination of digital, social and traditional media, as well as inventory listing sites to increase awareness and drive traffic to our websites and stores. During 2018, online traffic increased 28%. Total advertising expense, net of manufacturer credits, was $108.7 million in 2018, $93.3 million in 2017 and $81.4 million in 2016. In 2018, 78% was spent on digital, social, listings and owner communications while 22% of those funds were spent in traditional media. In all of our communications, we seek to convey the promise of a positive customer experience, competitive pricing and wide selection. We expect the portion of spending in digital channels to continue to increase as traditional media evolves to online consumption models.
Certain advertising and marketing expenditures are offset by manufacturer cooperative programs, which require us to submit requests for reimbursement to manufacturers for qualifying advertising expenditures. These advertising credits are not tied to specific vehicles and are earned as qualifying expenses are incurred. These reimbursements are recognized as a reduction of advertising expense. Manufacturer cooperative advertising credits were $25.5 million in 2018, $22.8 million in 2017 and $20.3 million in 2016.

Mobile traffic now accounts for over 60% of our web traffic and all of our sites utilize responsive technology to enhance the mobile and tablet experience. We are monitoring the increased use of voice search and have initiated partnerships with search engine platforms to ensure our stores' presence and to develop the tools customers desire. Our stores' websites aim to provide customers with a simple, transparent way to interact with us including: search new and used inventories, view current pricing and specials, calculate payments for purchase or lease, submit credit application, buy online, schedule service appointments and provide feedback about their experience.
We list our inventory on new and used vehicle listing services (e.g. cars.com, autotrader.com, cargurus.com, kbb.com, edmunds.com, craigslist, and local webpages) to reach more online shoppers. We also employ search engine optimization, search engine marketing, online display and re-targeting as well as video pre-roll to reach more online prospects.  We also encourage our stores to dedicate a larger percentage of their advertising spend to promoting service and repair work as we focus on customer acquisition and the value of customer retention. 
Franchise Agreements
Each of our stores operates under a separate agreement (a “Franchise Agreement”) with the manufacturer of the new vehicle brand it sells.
Typical automobile Franchise Agreements specify the locations within a designated market area at which the store may sell vehicles and related products and perform approved services. The designation of such areas and the allocation of new vehicles among stores are at the discretion of the manufacturer. Franchise Agreements do not, however, guarantee exclusivity within a specified territory.
A Franchise Agreement may impose requirements on the store with respect to:

• | facilities and equipment;


• | inventories of vehicles and parts;


• | minimum working capital;


• | training of personnel; and


• | performance standards for market share and customer satisfaction.

Each manufacturer closely monitors compliance with these requirements and requires each store to submit monthly financial statements. Franchise Agreements also grant a store the right to use and display manufacturers’ trademarks, service marks and designs in the manner approved by each manufacturer.
We have determined the useful life of a Franchise Agreement is indefinite, even though certain Franchise Agreements are renewed after one to six years. In our experience, agreements are routinely renewed without substantial cost and there are legal remedies to help prevent termination. Certain Franchise Agreements have no termination date. In addition, state franchise laws protect franchised automotive retailers. Under certain laws, a manufacturer may not terminate or fail to renew a franchise without good cause or prevent any reasonable changes in the capital structure or financing of a store.
The typical Franchise Agreement provides for early termination or non-renewal by the manufacturer upon:

• | a change of management or ownership without manufacturer consent;


• | insolvency or bankruptcy of the dealer;


• | death or incapacity of the dealer/manager;


• | conviction of a dealer/manager or owner of certain crimes;


• | misrepresentation of certain sales or inventory information by the store, dealer/manager or owner to the manufacturer;


• | failure to adequately operate the store;


• | failure to maintain any license, permit or authorization required for the conduct of business;


• | poor market share; or


• | low customer satisfaction index scores.

Franchise Agreements generally provide for prior written notice before a franchise may be terminated under most circumstances. We also sign master framework agreements with most manufacturers that impose additional requirements. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” 
Competition
The retail automotive business is highly competitive. Currently, there are approximately 18,000 stores in the United States, many of which are independent stores managed by individuals, families or small retail groups. We compete primarily with other automotive retailers, both publicly- and privately-held and other retailers such as Carvana, Shift and Vroom.
5

Vehicle manufacturers have designated specific marketing and sales areas within which only one dealer of a vehicle brand may operate. In addition, our Franchise Agreements typically limit our ability to acquire multiple dealerships of a given brand within a particular market area. Certain state franchise laws also restrict us from relocating our dealerships, or establishing new dealerships of a particular brand, within any area that is served by another dealer with the same brand. To the extent that a market has multiple dealers of a particular brand, as certain markets we operate in do, we are subject to significant intra-brand competition. 
We are larger and have more financial resources than most private automotive retailers with which we currently compete in the majority of our regional markets. We compete directly with retailers with similar or greater resources in our existing metro and non-metro markets. If we enter other new markets, we may face competitors that are larger or have access to greater financial resources. We do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from manufacturers. We rely on advertising and merchandising, pricing, our customer guarantees and sales model, our sales expertise, service reputation and the location of our stores to sell new vehicles.
Regulation
Automotive and Other Laws and Regulations
We operate in a highly regulated industry. A number of state and federal laws and regulations affect our business. In every state in which we operate, we must obtain various licenses to operate our businesses, including dealer, sales and finance and insurance licenses issued by state regulatory authorities. Numerous laws and regulations govern our business, including those relating to our sales, operations, financing, insurance, advertising and employment practices. These laws and regulations include state franchise laws and regulations, consumer protection laws, privacy laws, escheatment laws, anti-money laundering laws and federal and state wage-hour, anti-discrimination and other employment practices laws.
Our financing activities with customers are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. In recent years, there has been an increase in activity related to oversight of consumer lending by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), which has broad regulatory powers. The CFPB does not have direct authority over automotive dealers; however, its regulation of larger automotive finance companies and other financial institutions could affect our financing activities. Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted against us or our stores by individuals, a class of individuals, or governmental entities. These claims may expose us to significant damages or other penalties, including revocation or suspension of our licenses to conduct store operations and fines.
The vehicles we sell are also subject to rules and regulations of various federal and state regulatory agencies.
Environmental, Health, and Safety Laws and Regulations
Our operations involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling and/or disposal of materials such as motor oil and filters, transmission fluids, antifreeze, refrigerants, paints, thinners, batteries, cleaning products, lubricants, degreasing agents, tires and fuel. Consequently, our business is subject to a complex variety of federal, state and local requirements that regulate the environment and public health and safety.
Most of our stores use above ground storage tanks, and, to a lesser extent, underground storage tanks, primarily for petroleum-based products. Storage tanks are subject to periodic testing, containment, upgrading and removal under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and its state law counterparts. Clean-up or other remedial action may be necessary in the event of leaks or other discharges from storage tanks or other sources. In addition, water quality protection programs under the federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act), the Safe Drinking Water Act and comparable state and local programs govern certain discharges from our operations. Similarly, certain air emissions from operations, such as auto body painting, may be subject to the federal Clean Air Act and related state and local laws. Health and safety standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States Department of Labor and related state agencies also apply.
Certain stores may become a party to proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, typically in connection with materials that were sent to former recycling, treatment and/or disposal facilities owned and operated by independent businesses. The remediation or clean-up of facilities where the release of a regulated hazardous substance occurred is required under CERCLA and other laws.
We incur certain costs to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the ordinary course of our business. We do not anticipate, however, that the costs of such compliance will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, although such outcome is possible given the nature of our operations and the extensive environmental, public health and safety regulatory framework. We may become aware of minor contamination at certain of our 
6

facilities, and we conduct investigations and remediation at properties as needed. In certain cases, the current or prior property owner may conduct the investigation and/or remediation or we have been indemnified by either the current or prior property owner for such contamination. We do not currently expect to incur significant costs for remediation. However, no assurances can be given that material environmental commitments or contingencies will not arise in the future, or that they do not already exist but are unknown to us.
Employees
Our mission statement is "Growth Powered by People." We cultivate an entrepreneurial, high-performance culture and strive to develop leaders from within. We continue to develop tools, training and growth opportunities that accelerate the depth of our talent. One example of this is our AMP program (Accelerate My Potential), which began in 2016. This program is designed to deepen the knowledge of future leaders in all aspects of our business and develop leadership skills to better position participants for a future as a general manager in one of our stores. During 2018, we realized a 76% year-over-year increase in the number of internal management hires compared to 2017.
The U.S. economy is highly dependent upon the retail sector as a significant employer. Wages are typically low in the sector given that there are often no formal eduction credentials required. As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 13,643 persons on a full-time equivalent basis in our nationwide network of 181 retail locations. Unlike many standard retailers, employees within our dealership network earn above average wages. Employees in our retail locations earned an average wage of $16.94 per hour during 2018 compared to the national median pay for retail workers of $11.70 per hour, according to the 2017 survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This equates to average annual earnings in excess of $35,000 per year, 45% higher than the median pay in the retail sector. In addition, the average hourly wage for our retail locations exceeds the minimum wage in all 18 states in which we operate.
Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations
Historically, our sales have been lower during the first quarter of each year due to consumer purchasing patterns during the holiday season and inclement weather in certain of our markets. The timing of our acquisition activity, which varies, and ability to integrate stores into our existing cost structure has moderated this seasonality. However, if conditions occur that weaken automotive sales, such as severe weather in the geographic areas in which our dealerships operate, war, high fuel costs, depressed economic conditions including unemployment or weakened consumer confidence or similar adverse conditions, or if our ability to acquire stores changes, our revenues for the year may be disproportionately adversely affected.
Available Information and NYSE Compliance
We file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). The SEC maintains an Internet Web site at http://www.sec.gov where you may access copies of our SEC filings. We also make available free of charge, on our website at www.lithiainvestorrelations.com, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed electronically with the SEC.
