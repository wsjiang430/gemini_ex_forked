Industry Trends
Our industry is composed of national, regional and local companies that provide services to customers in a range of industries. We believe the following industry trends affect demand for our services: 
Industry Opportunities in our Communications Segment
Significant advances in technology and rapid innovation in service offerings to data consumers continue to increase demand for faster and more reliable wireless and wireline/fiber communications network services. In its 2018 Visual Networking Index: Forecast and Trends, 2017-2022 report (the “2018 VNI report”), Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”) predicts that global network traffic will increase nearly threefold over the next five years. Additionally, broadband connection speeds are expected to nearly double by 2022, from approximately 40 Mbps to 75 Mbps. With increased usage of mobile devices and advancements in the “internet of things,” the amount of data affecting network traffic has grown significantly, and is expected to continue to experience dramatic growth. Increased data usage from video and voice transmission, digital video and music streaming, ‘smart’ television technology, home automation and connected home monitoring offerings, artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality and other advanced data services, including machine-to-machine connections such as autonomous vehicles, video surveillance, smart meters and digital health monitors, have, and will continue, to increase data traffic, resulting in the need for new and upgraded networks. One industry publication predicts that the demand for data capacity in ten years could be almost 1,000 times what it is today, and Cisco, in its 2018 VNI report, predicts that the number of devices connected to the network will exceed three times the global population by 2022. 
In response to these growing demands, multiple major carriers have continued to expand, densify and optimize current wireless and wireline/fiber communications network capacity, while planning for next generation evolution technology including 5th generation (“5G”) wireless and fixed wireless network capacity, as well as enhanced broadband connection speeds. Large scale 5G deployments are expected over the next several years, which will include additional and improved tower capacity, as well as deployment of numerous higher bandwidth small/micro cells and distributed antenna systems to densify network performance. In addition, nationwide fiber projects in conjunction with 5G network deployment, such as Verizon Communications Inc.’s launch of “One Fiber,” expanded in 2018 and are expected to continue to rapidly expand to support network densification, data capacity and speed. These factors are expected to create incremental opportunities for investment in communications infrastructure in addition to the continued expansion and deployment by telephone companies and cable operators of fiber-to-the-home with 1-Gigabit-per-second high-speed internet connectivity. In addition, in 2017, AT&T was selected to build and run the First Responder Network Authority (“FirstNetTM”), a new wireless official public safety network for first responders throughout the United States, for which construction and limited operation commenced in 2018. AT&T has stated that it expects to spend approximately $40 billion over the next 25 years as it builds, manages and expands capacity in the network, along with a potential $6.5 billion federal government sponsored investment by FirstNetTM within the next five years.

One industry publication anticipates that up to an estimated $250 billion will be invested in 5G technologies over the next decade, and another industry publication predicts that the United States will require up to an estimated $150 billion of fiber infrastructure investment over the next five to seven years to support the increases in projected mobile data traffic and related broadband infrastructure needs. Multiple carriers tested and launched 5G initiatives in 2018, and nationwide fiber deployment projects are expected to continue to rapidly expand in the coming years. Furthermore, in the second half of 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) announced an initiative to speed deployment of 5G technology in the U.S. through the Facilitate America’s Superiority in 5G Technology, or “FAST” Plan. This plan is designed to make more low, mid and high-band spectrum available to the market and encourage additional investment in 5G wireless infrastructure by streamlining regulatory processes and updating infrastructure policies to speed the review of small cell infrastructure. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2018, the FCC also made available additional funds for the deployment of high-speed broadband technology under the Connect America Fund, which is designed to improve the quality and expand the availability of high-speed internet service in rural areas. 
In the home installation and customer fulfillment markets, we believe that growth opportunities will be driven by customers seeking to expand their service offerings in the areas of home automation, connected home security monitoring and control, home entertainment offerings and commercial energy management solutions.
We believe that we are well positioned as one of the largest providers of communications and install-to-the-home infrastructure services to significantly benefit from the significant and multiple infrastructure opportunities as previously described. In addition, the buildout and deployment of the FirstNetTM network commenced in 2018, and is expected to create additional demand for our services in 2019 and beyond. These initiatives as well as recent trends toward streamlining regulatory processes to speed the deployment of 5G technology are expected to drive communications infrastructure investment for years to come.
Industry Opportunities in our Oil and Gas Segment
We are one of the leading pipeline contractors in North America, with a balanced portfolio of service offerings, including the construction and maintenance of large diameter (“long-haul”) pipeline, midstream pipeline, gathering lines and related compressor and pumping stations and treatment plants, offering both union and non-union services. Demand for pipeline infrastructure and the related level of oil, natural gas and product pipeline construction activity has grown significantly in recent years as technological advances and increasingly cost-effective production technologies have significantly increased producible North American oil and natural gas reserves. Technological advances in seismic imaging and data analysis have led to improvements in the identification of oil and natural gas reserves as well as the precision with which drilling operations can be performed, lowering the cost of production and maximizing output. The effect of these advances on oil and gas production activities in North America has also driven changes in the geographic locations of North American energy production. The increase in oil and natural gas production driven by these advances, as well as from robust demand, has led to ‘takeaway’ capacity issues, whereby more pipeline infrastructure is required to move this increased level of production to market. For example, the Permian, Bakken and Marcellus/Utica basins have experienced significant growth in production for which additional takeaway capacity is required. Permian basin oil production is expected to double by 2023, according to IHS Markit’s June 2018 Market Outlook report. Additionally, industry reporting indicates that the abundance of low-cost North American natural gas will continue to drive growth of natural gas as a source of lower-carbon power generation, both in the U.S. and abroad. In 2018, natural gas continued to surpass coal as the leading fuel type for electric power generation, and the Department of Energy’s (“DOE”) Annual Energy Outlook 2019 predicts that the U.S., which is already a net exporter of natural gas, will become a net exporter of energy, including oil and natural gas, by the early 2020s. In addition, demand for liquified natural gas (“LNG”) exports has risen dramatically in recent years, driven in part by the easing of certain export regulations, which is expected to drive construction of pipeline infrastructure for the transport of LNG to coastal export facilities in North America. 
These trends are expected to continue to drive demand for U.S. oil and gas production, creating expanded opportunities for new pipeline infrastructure throughout North America. Significant investment in pipeline infrastructure will be required to move the increased volumes of oil and gas production to refining centers, distribution hubs, LNG export facilities and industrial users throughout North America, as well as to meet demand resulting from the desire to convert the transportation of oil and gas from traditional methods, such as truck and rail transport, to lower cost and safer pipeline infrastructure. According to the Pipeline & Gas Journal’s 2019 Global Pipeline Construction Outlook, there are approximately 36,000 miles of new and planned pipeline projects within North America, an increase of over 12% from the January 2017 report findings. In March 2018, the C Three Group predicted that over 10,000 miles of new oil and gas pipelines would be built over the three year period from 2018 to 2020, and in December 2018, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) reported over 2,400 miles of pending onshore natural gas pipeline projects, three quarters of which are pipelines 100 miles or more in length. We anticipate that demand for pipeline infrastructure in North America will provide significant opportunities for years to come, and that our diverse capabilities and expertise will enable us to continue to be a leading service provider in this market.
 We also believe that future opportunities exist for upgrades to existing pipeline infrastructure, including pipeline integrity and maintenance upgrades, modernization efforts, including digitization and other technology upgrades and upgrades to address safety regulations.
In addition to potential opportunities in the U.S., initiatives in Mexico are expected to provide long-term growth opportunities. These initiatives call for a shift from fuel oils to more environmentally sensitive and cleaner natural gas, including a program for the long-term importation of natural gas from the U.S., to provide for cleaner and more economical electrical power generation and energy usage. In 2017, MasTec completed construction on two pipelines to move U.S. sourced natural gas to the Mexico/U.S. border. We believe there will be additional pipeline infrastructure opportunities for the delivery of U.S. natural gas to Mexico, as well as opportunities within Mexico, in the coming years. 
We believe that the above mentioned trends will support continued expanded levels of project activity, creating a multi-year cycle of demand for pipeline construction projects, and that we are well positioned to benefit from these trends.
Industry Opportunities in our Electrical Transmission Segment
The U.S. electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure requires significant ongoing maintenance, upgrade and expansion to continue delivery of reliable and affordable power, as well as to address future reliability needs. Additional investment in electrical infrastructure will be required to address power line congestion and to avoid delivery failure during peak periods, as well as to modernize the grid and strengthen aging infrastructure 
6

to withstand weather events, natural disasters and cyber threats. In addition, older power plants, including coal-fired and nuclear plants, continue to be retired, requiring replacement infrastructure. Regional shifts in population and industry could also create incremental demand for transmission and distribution construction and upgrades. According to a January 2019 industry publication, capital expenditures in the power and utilities sector exceeded $130 billion in 2018, with further growth expected in 2019. 
Future demand for electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure is also expected to result from technological innovations, deployment of digital capabilities, expected growth in usage of electric/hybrid vehicles, and the continued development of electrical power generation from renewable power sources, among others. The expected growth in demand for, and deployment of, electrical power generation from renewable energy sources will require significant investment in transmission lines, as wind and solar power generation resources are typically located in remote areas of the country, far from industrial users and major population centers.  Transmission lines will be required to connect the power generated from renewable energy sources to electrical grid and infrastructure will also be required to provide for grid-scale storage of electricity from such renewable energy sources. 
According to the DOE’s Annual Energy Outlook 2019, almost 450 net gigawatts of new electricity generating capacity are expected to be added in the U.S. through 2050, requiring significant investment in transmission and distribution by electric utility companies. Electrical grid upgrades and expansions in Canada and Mexico may also create opportunities for electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure services. We believe significant capital investment in the transmission and distribution system will continue to be required to meet the above mentioned needs, and that we are well positioned to benefit from these trends.
Industry Opportunities in our Power Generation and Industrial Segment
Growing interest in climate change initiatives and the desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, together with growing corporate initiatives and certain regulatory and other policy initiatives at the federal, state and municipal levels, have spurred demand for energy production from sustainable, “green” power sources, including environmentally sensitive electrical power production from renewable sources such as wind, solar and biomass. Currently, almost 40 states, as well as the District of Columbia and four territories, have adopted renewable portfolio standards (“RPS”) or renewable energy goals. Approximately half of the states with RPS targets currently plan to achieve those targets by 2021, and others are considering increases to their current RPS targets. The DOE’s Annual Energy Outlook 2019 projects that 70 gigawatts of new wind and solar capacity will be added from 2018 to 2021 and predicts that renewable power generation will contribute over 30% of U.S. power generation capacity by 2050. These trends, coupled with advancing technologies and improvements in the cost performance and scalability of wind and solar power projects, are expected to continue to drive demand for construction of renewable resources throughout North America in the coming years. In addition to expected growth in demand for construction of new wind power installations, additional opportunities in wind infrastructure are being driven by recent trends toward replacement of existing wind turbines with next generation, higher efficiency turbines, as well as from maintenance of aging wind farms, including the repowering of wind turbines and foundations, which enables existing wind farms to produce more electricity at a lower cost. 
The renewable energy industry is partially reliant on federal and state tax incentives, which have limited terms.  Currently, there are certain federal tax incentives applicable to the renewable energy industry, including production and investment tax credits that have historically increased investments in these projects.  Other tax incentives applicable to the renewable energy industry include accelerated tax depreciation provisions, including bonus depreciation, for certain renewable energy generation assets, such as equipment using solar or wind energy, or energy from geothermal deposits or biomass. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors - The renewable energy industry is reliant on tax incentives, the availability of which may be uncertain and could adversely affect demand for our services.” Notwithstanding the potential phase-out of these tax incentives, the continued and increasing trends towards renewable portfolio standards, coupled with growing corporate initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, are expected to continue to drive growth in renewable energy projects. 
In addition, industrial plant construction opportunities exist in a wide variety of industries, including in the renewable energy industry. The low price and environmental advantage of clean burning of natural gas is expected to continue to drive demand for gas-fired electrical generating plants, conversions of coal-fired power plants to cleaner natural gas and the construction of other plants which use natural gas as a fuel source. Industrial facilities and power plants in the biofuels/biomass, food processing, natural gas, petroleum and related industries present opportunities as additional domestic energy reserves are produced, transported and processed. 
We are one of the leading renewables contractors in North America, with expertise in wind, solar and biomass, as well as industrial and other power plant construction, and expect to benefit from these market trends.

Through the services we provide, we also help our customers deliver their sustainable goals. We are one of the largest renewables contractors in North America, having constructed a significant percentage of North America’s wind farms. Our renewables business also builds solar power plants and biofuel/biomass infrastructure. In our Oil and Gas segment, we perform engineering, construction and maintenance services on oil and natural gas pipelines and processing facilities for the energy and utilities industries. In many cases, we are helping consumers and customers access cleaner burning natural gas by providing transportation infrastructure for businesses and consumers that wish to switch to these cleaner burning and lower carbon emission fuel sources. We also provide state-of-the-art pipeline transportation options, which consume fewer hydrocarbons in the transportation process than do traditional truck and rail transport.
We have received numerous awards from our customers for our efforts in sustainability practices, and are committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. In our largest fleet operation, we have developed sophisticated routing, scheduling and fuel management programs that significantly reduce our consumption of fuel. Additionally, as part of our effort to reduce our overall carbon footprint, we have invested in equipment that is equipped with advanced emissions reduction technologies, and we use GPS technologies to improve fleet efficiency and fuel consumption. We also have recycling programs for discarded materials and programs for the proper handling and disposition of hazardous wastes, and we strive to incorporate energy efficiencies and other conservation measures into our office building designs. 
We seek to align the interests of our Board of Directors and management with that of our shareholders. We believe that an independent, well-diversified Board makes us a better corporate citizen, and we have a Board with racial, ethnic, gender and skill diversity.  We also believe that our separation of Chairman and CEO further enhances accountability and social responsibility. Our management team and our Board of Directors also have significant ownership in MasTec’s common stock, which further aligns their interests with those of our other shareholders.  
We have detailed governance procedures, including an Audit Committee Charter, a Compensation Committee Charter and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter, as well as a comprehensive Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Board of Director Governance Principles, all of which can be reviewed on the “Investors” page of our website at MasTec.com.
Strategy
The key elements of our business strategy are as follows: 
Focus on Growth Opportunities. We believe that our end-markets offer multiple growth opportunities, and we expect continued spending by key customers in many of the industries we serve. We expect development of wireless and wireline/fiber infrastructure; oil and natural gas pipeline infrastructure; expansion, maintenance and upgrades of electrical transmission capacity and the electrical distribution grid; development of power generation infrastructure, including renewables; and heavy civil and industrial infrastructure construction projects to be areas of investment and opportunity in the coming years. We intend to use our broad geographic presence, technical expertise, financial and operational resources, customer relationships and full range of services to capitalize on these trends and grow our business. 
Operational Excellence. We seek to improve our profit margins and cash flows by focusing on services and projects that have high margin potential. We also strive to identify opportunities for leverage within our business, such as deploying resources across multiple customers and projects in order to enhance our operating effectiveness and utilization rates. We also seek to maintain strong working capital management practices. Our management team pursues actions and programs designed to achieve these goals, such as increasing accountability throughout our organization, effectively managing customer contract bidding procedures, evaluating opportunities to improve our working capital cycle time, hiring and retaining experienced operating and financial professionals, and developing, expanding and integrating the use of financial systems and information technology capabilities within our business.
Maintain Conservative Capital Structure. We evaluate our capital structure on an ongoing basis and have expanded our financial resources in recent years. We believe that we have sufficient capital resources to fund our planned operations. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $555 million of borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility, with aggregate borrowing commitments of $1.5 billion under our senior secured credit facility and $400 million of 4.875% senior notes due 2023. We may consider opportunities to borrow additional funds, or to refinance, repurchase or retire outstanding debt or repurchase shares as part of our ongoing capital structure evaluation. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Summary of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources,” for details pertaining to our debt instruments and share repurchase activities.
8

Leverage Core Performance and Expertise through Strategic Acquisitions and Other Arrangements. We may pursue selected acquisitions, investments and strategic arrangements that allow us to expand our operations, service offerings, customer base or geographic reach. We have diversified our business and expanded our service offerings and geographic footprint in recent years, both organically and through acquisition. In order to maximize their potential, our strategy is to integrate acquired businesses into our operations and internal control environment in a timely and efficient manner. We evaluate our business on a regular basis, and from time to time, we may divest certain businesses or assets, or curtail selected business activities or operations that do not produce adequate revenue or margin or that no longer fit within our long-term business strategy.
Services
Our core services are the engineering, building, installing, maintaining and upgrading of infrastructure, primarily for communications, oil and gas, utility and power generation customers. We provide similar services to each of these customers, including: 
Build. We build infrastructure projects for customers across a range of industries. We specialize in building underground and overhead distribution systems, including trenches, conduits, cell towers, cable and power lines, which provide wireless and wireline/fiber communications; natural gas, crude oil and refined product transport pipelines; electrical power generation, transmission and distribution systems; power generation infrastructure, including renewable energy; heavy industrial plants; compressor and pump stations and treatment plants; water and sewer infrastructure; and other civil construction infrastructure.
Install. We install electrical and other energy distribution and transmission systems, power generation facilities, buried and aerial fiber optic and other cables, satellite dishes, home automation and energy management solutions in a variety of environments for our customers. In connection with our installation work, we deploy and manage network connections that involve our customers’ hardware, software and network equipment. 
Maintain and Upgrade. We offer 24 hour/365 days-a-year maintenance and upgrade support to our customers. Our comprehensive service offerings include the regular maintenance of our customers’ distribution facilities, networks and infrastructure, including natural gas and petroleum pipeline, communications, electrical distribution and transmission, power generation and heavy civil infrastructure. We also provide emergency services for accidents or storm damage. Our upgrade work ranges from routine replacements and upgrades to major overhauls. 
Customers
We have longstanding relationships with many customers, and often provide services under master service and other service agreements, which are generally multi-year agreements. Our master service agreements are typically exclusive up to a specified dollar amount per work order for each defined geographic area, but do not obligate our customers to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us. Work performed under master service and other service agreements is usually generated through work orders, each of which is performed for a fixed fee. Services provided under these agreements range from engineering, project management and installation work to maintenance and upgrade services. Master service and other service agreements are frequently awarded on a competitive bidding basis, although customers are sometimes willing to negotiate contract extensions beyond their original terms without re-bidding. Our master service and other service agreements have various terms, depending upon the nature of the services provided, and typically provide for termination on short or no advance notice. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, 35%, 36% and 43% of our revenue, respectively, was derived from projects performed under master service and other service agreements. 
The remainder of our work is generated pursuant to contracts for specific projects or jobs requiring the construction and installation of an entire infrastructure system or specified units within an entire infrastructure system. Customers are billed with varying frequency, the timing of which is generally dependent upon advance billing terms, milestone billings based on completion of certain phases of the work, or when services are provided. Under the typical payment terms of master and other service agreements and contracts for specific projects, the customer makes progress payments based on quantifiable measures of performance as defined in the agreements. Some of our contracts include retainage provisions, under which a portion of the contract amount (generally, from 5% to 10% of billings) can be retained by the customer until final contract settlement. 
We believe that our industry experience, technical expertise and reputation for customer service, as well as the relationships developed between our customers and our senior management and project management teams are important to our being retained by our customers. See Note 13 - Segments and Related Information and Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference, for customer concentration information. 
Backlog
Estimated backlog represents the amount of revenue we expect to realize over the next 18 months from future work on uncompleted construction contracts, including new contracts under which work has not begun, as well as revenue from change orders and renewal options. Our estimated backlog also includes amounts under master service and other service agreements and includes our proportionate share of estimated revenue from proportionately consolidated non-controlled contractual joint ventures. Estimated backlog for work under master service and other service agreements is determined based on historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts, experience from similar projects and estimates of customer demand based on communications with our customers. We expect to realize approximately 80% of our estimated year end 2018 backlog in 2019. The following table presents 18-month estimated backlog by reportable segment, as of the dates indicated:
9


Reportable Segment (in millions): | December 31, 2018 | | September 30, 2018 | | December 31, 2017
Communications | $ | 4,276 | | | $ | 4,251 | | $ | 3,628
Oil and Gas | 2,125 | | | 2,253 | | | 2,525
Electrical Transmission | 610 | | | 597 | | | 354 
Power Generation and Industrial | 678 | | | 731 | | | 577 
Other | 1 | | | 1 | | | 3 
Estimated 18-month backlog | $ | 7,690 | | | $ | 7,833 | | $ | 7,087

Approximately half of our backlog as of December 31, 2018 is attributable to amounts under master service or other service agreements, pursuant to which our customers are not contractually committed to purchase a minimum amount of services. Most of these agreements can be canceled on short or no advance notice. Timing of revenue for construction and installation projects included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of customer delays or cancellations, regulatory delays or other factors and/or other project-related factors. These changes could cause estimated revenue to be realized in periods later than originally expected, or not at all. We occasionally experience postponements, cancellations and reductions in expected future work from master service agreements and/or construction projects due to changes in our customers’ spending plans, market volatility and regulatory factors. There can be no assurance as to our customers’ requirements or the accuracy of our estimates. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings. 
Backlog is not a term recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”); however, it is a common measurement used in our industry. Our methodology for determining backlog may not, however, be comparable to the methodologies used by others. Backlog differs from the amount of our remaining performance obligations, which are described in Note 1 - Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference. As of December 31, 2018 total 18-month backlog differed from the amount of our remaining performance obligations due primarily to the inclusion of $2.9 billion of estimates of future revenue under master service and other service agreements within our backlog estimates, as described above, and the exclusion of approximately $300 million of remaining performance obligations in excess of 18 months, which amount is not included in the backlog estimates above. Backlog expected to be realized in 2019 differed from the amount of remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized for the same period due primarily to the inclusion of approximately $1.7 billion of estimates of future revenue under master service and other service agreements that is included within the related backlog estimate.
Sales and Marketing
Our customers increasingly require resources from multiple disciplines. Therefore, our subsidiary services companies market their services not only individually, but also in combination with other companies, including other MasTec companies and independent companies, to provide what we believe are the most efficient and effective solutions to meet our customers’ demands. Through our unified MasTec® brand and an integrated organizational structure designed to permit rapid deployment of labor, equipment and materials, we are able to quickly and efficiently allocate resources to meet customer needs. We offer services that are branded under the MasTec® service mark and other service marks. 
We have developed a marketing plan emphasizing the MasTec® registered service mark and trade names of certain acquired companies, as well as an integrated service offering to position ourselves as a provider of a full range of service solutions, providing services including installation as well as sophisticated engineering, design and integration. We believe our longstanding relationships with customers and our reputation for reliability and efficiency facilitate our recurring business. Our marketing efforts are principally carried out by the management of our business units and project groups in coordination with our corporate business development organization. Our management team has many years of industry experience, both at the service provider level, and in some cases, with the customers we serve. Our business unit and project group managers market directly to existing and potential customers for new contracts and also seek our inclusion on lists of vendors invited to submit proposals for service agreements and individual projects. We also market our services in conjunction with certain business partners, strategic investments and arrangements. Our executive management supplements these efforts at the national and international level. 
Safety and Insurance/Risk Management
We strive to instill and enforce safe work habits in our employees, and we require that our employees participate in training programs relevant to their employment, including all those required by law. We evaluate employees in part based upon their safety records and the safety records of the employees they supervise. Our business units have established robust safety programs to monitor and improve compliance with safety procedures and regulations. We also provide company-wide training where appropriate, including for information technology and cyber security as well as for workplace and employee awareness programs. 
Our business involves the use of heavy equipment and exposure to potentially dangerous workplace conditions. While we are committed to operating safely and prudently, we are subject to claims by employees, customers and third parties for property damage and personal injuries that occur in connection with our work. Our insurance policies are subject to high deductibles and we are self-insured up to the amount of the deductible. We maintain insurance policies for workers’ compensation, general liability and automobile liability that are subject to per claim deductibles. We also maintain excess umbrella coverage and an insurance policy with respect to employee group medical claims, which is subject to annual per employee maximum losses. We are required to post collateral to certain of our insurance carriers, generally in the form of letters of credit, surety bonds and cash. See Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference.

Suppliers, Materials and Working Capital
Under many of our contracts, our customers provide the necessary materials and supplies for projects and we are responsible for the installation of, but not the cost or warranty of those materials. Under certain other projects, we purchase the necessary materials and supplies on behalf of our customers from third-party providers. We are not dependent on any one vendor and have not experienced significant difficulty in obtaining project-related materials or supplies as and when required for the projects we manage. 
We utilize independent contractors to assist on projects and to help us manage our work flow. Our independent contractors typically provide their own vehicles, tools and insurance coverage. We are not dependent on any one independent contractor. We need working capital to support seasonal variations in our business, including the spending patterns of our customers and the effects of weather conditions on external construction and maintenance work, both of which can influence the timing of spending to support related customer demand. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Working Capital,” which is incorporated by reference. 
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with a number of companies in the markets in which we operate, ranging from small local independent companies to large national firms. The national or large regional firms that compete with us include Quanta Services, Inc., MYR Group, Inc., Dycom Industries, Inc., Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Primoris Services Corporation, Pike Electric, Inc., Bechtel Corporation, D.H. Blattner & Sons, Inc., M.A. Mortenson Company, Black & Veatch and Nexius.
Certain barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate, including adequate financial resources, technical expertise, high safety ratings and a proven track record of operational success. Some of our customers employ their own personnel to perform infrastructure services of the type we provide. We compete based upon our industry experience, technical expertise, financial and operational resources, geographic presence, industry reputation, safety record and reputation for customer service. While we believe our customers consider a number of factors when selecting a service provider, they award most of their work through a bid process, and price is often a principal factor in determining which service provider is selected. 
Regulation, Environmental and Climate Change Matters
We are subject to state and federal laws that apply to businesses generally, including laws and regulations related to labor relations, wages, worker safety and environmental protection. While many of our customers operate in regulated industries (for example, utilities regulated by the public service commission or communications companies regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), we are not generally subject to such regulation and oversight. 
As a contractor, our operations are subject to various laws, including: 

• | regulations related to worker safety and health, including those established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and state equivalents;


• | regulations related to vehicle registrations, including those of the states and the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”);


• | contractor licensing requirements;


• | permitting and inspection requirements; and


• | building and electrical codes.

We are also subject to numerous environmental laws, regulations and programs, including the handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, laws governing emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges into air, surface water, groundwater and soil, and programs related to the protection of endangered species. 
We have a substantial investment in construction equipment that utilizes fuel. Any changes in laws requiring us to use equipment that runs on alternative fuels could require a significant investment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of properties, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our business. In addition, we could be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations. Our contracts with customers may also impose liabilities on us regarding environmental issues that arise through the performance of our services. From time to time, we may incur costs and obligations related to environmental compliance and/or remediation matters. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities.” 
We believe we have all material licenses and permits needed to conduct operations and that we are in material compliance with all applicable regulatory and environmental requirements. We could, however, incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with such requirements.
The potential effects of climate change on our operations is highly uncertain. Climate change may result in, among other things, changes in rainfall patterns, storm patterns and intensities and temperature levels. Our operating results are significantly influenced by weather. Therefore, major changes in weather patterns could have a significant effect on our future operating results. For example, if climate change results in significantly more adverse weather conditions in a given period, we could experience reduced productivity, which could negatively affect our revenue and profitability. Climate change could also affect our customers and the projects that they award. Demand for power projects, underground pipelines or other projects could be negatively affected by significant changes in weather or from legislation or regulations governing climate change. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are subject to risks associated with climate change."
