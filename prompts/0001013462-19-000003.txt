The product is expected to be commercially available in the first half of 2019.
Similarly, the Company maintains marketing and software development relationships with leading EDA software companies, including Cadence Design Systems, Synopsys, Mentor Graphics, Zuken and National Instruments. These relationships support the transfer of data between electronics design and layout software and the ANSYS electronics simulation portfolio. In 2017, the Company entered into an integration and distribution agreement with Synopsys to cooperatively integrate ANSYS RedHawk technology into an in-design add-on to a Synopsys design tool for the primary purpose of providing customers with direct, in-design access to the RedHawk technology's capabilities. 
The Company also has a relationship with Spatial Corp. to provide the 3D modeling kernel technology upon which the Company's in-house geometry modeling software solutions are built.
The main method that ANSYS employs to democratize HPC to a wider audience is through partnerships with a number of companies, such as cloud-hosting providers, HPC hardware manufacturers and supercomputing centers such as HLRS in Stuttgart, Germany. The cloud partners not only provide HPC services, but also the back-end infrastructure to those customers who lack the in-house HPC or IT staff, but still want the ability to increase computational resources quickly. In addition, ANSYS has established partnerships with HPC partners that provide appliances, or pre-configured racks of computational hardware optimized and configured to run ANSYS software.
The Company's open cloud strategy allows it to work with various public cloud providers and cloud hosting partners. This approach makes it easy for customers to use the same workflows on-premise and in the Cloud. In addition, the Company strengthened its other cloud-hosting service partnerships by further improving best practices for executing engineering simulation in the Cloud. Cloud-hosting partners such as Nimbix, Rescale and Gompute provide friction-free cloud access to ANSYS solutions for customers. Furthermore, the Company enjoys mutually-committed alliances with large cloud platform providers such as Microsoft and AWS. In 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with SAP to embed ANSYS' pervasive simulation solutions for digital twins into SAP's market-leading digital supply chain, manufacturing and asset management portfolio. The partnership's first solution, expected in 2019, will run on SAP Cloud Platform and empower industrial asset operators to optimize operations and maintenance through real-time engineering insights, to reduce product cycle times and increase profitability.

ANSYS nCode DesignLife™ technology leverages the open architecture of the ANSYS platform and enables mechanical engineers to more easily address complex product life and durability issues before a prototype is built.
COMPETITION
The Company believes that the principal factors affecting sales of its software include ease of use, breadth and depth of functionality, flexibility, quality, ease of integration with other software systems, file compatibility across computer platforms, range of supported computer platforms, performance, price and total cost of ownership, customer service and support, company reputation and financial viability, and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts.
The Company continues to experience competition across all markets for its products and services. The Company's competitors include large, global, publicly traded companies; small, geographically-focused firms; startup firms; and solutions produced in-house by the end users. Some of the Company's current and possible future competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than the Company, and some have well-established relationships with current and potential customers of the Company. The Company's current and possible future competitors also include firms that have elected, or may in the future elect, to compete by means of open source licensing. These competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions and/or increased operating costs, and could result in lower revenues, margins and net income.
PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND LICENSES
The Company regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of trade secret, copyright, patent and trademark laws, license agreements, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products. The Company distributes its software products under software license agreements that grant customers nonexclusive licenses, which are typically nontransferable, for the use of the Company's products. License agreements for the Company's products are directly between the Company and end users. Use of the licensed software product is restricted to specified sites unless the customer obtains a multi-site license for its use of the software product or the software product is by its nature a multi-site use product. Software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of the Company's software products and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction. For most products, customers may purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance, technical support and upgrades, or may lease the product on a fixed-term basis for a fee that includes the license, maintenance, technical support and upgrades. For its Discovery products, customers purchase an annual subscription for a certain number of named users that includes the license, maintenance, technical support and upgrades.
The Company licenses its software products utilizing a combination of web-based and hard-copy license terms and forms. For certain software products, the Company primarily relies on "click-wrapped" licenses (i.e. online agreements where the website provider posts terms and conditions, and the user clicks on the "accept" button). The enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain.
The Company also seeks to protect the source code of its software as a trade secret and as unpublished copyrighted work. The Company has obtained federal trademark registration protection for ANSYS and other marks in the U.S. and foreign countries. Additionally, the Company was awarded numerous patents by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and has a number of patent applications pending. To the extent the Company does not choose to seek patent protection for its intellectual property, the Company primarily relies on the protection of its source code as a trade secret.
Employees of the Company have signed agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information. These agreements, where legally permitted, restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with the Company anywhere in the world while employed by the Company (and, in some cases, for specified periods thereafter) and state that any products or technology created by employees during their term of employment are the property of the Company. In addition, the Company requires all channel partners to enter into agreements not to disclose the Company's trade secrets and other proprietary information. 
Despite these precautions, there can be no assurance that misappropriation of the Company's technology and proprietary information (including source code) will be prevented. Further, there can be no assurance that copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret protection will be available for the Company's products in certain jurisdictions, or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with the Company will be enforceable. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary in the future to enforce the Company's rights to its trade secrets and proprietary information or to enforce its patent rights and copyrights, and it is possible that, in the future, the Company's competitors may be able to obtain the Company's trade secrets or to independently develop similar, unpatented technology.
10

The software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Therefore, the Company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, name recognition and reliable product maintenance are also important to establishing and maintaining technology leadership in addition to the various legal protections of its technology that may be available. 
The Company does not believe that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not claim such infringement by the Company or its licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products. The Company expects that software suppliers will increasingly be subject to the risk of such claims as the number of products and suppliers continues to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product release delays or require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to the Company.
SEASONAL VARIATIONS
The Company's business has experienced seasonality, including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from slowdowns of customer activities during the summer months, particularly in Europe, as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of the Company's global customers. Lease and maintenance contract renewals are typically highest in the first and fourth quarters. The Company's revenue is typically highest in the fourth quarter.
DEFERRED REVENUE AND BACKLOG
Deferred revenue consists of billings made or payments received in advance of revenue recognition. The deferred revenue on the Company's consolidated balance sheets does not represent the total value of annual or multi-year, noncancellable agreements. The Company's backlog represents installment billings for periods beyond the current quarterly billing cycle and customer orders received but not processed. The Company's deferred revenue and backlog as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 consisted of the following:

The revolving credit facility will be available for general corporate purposes, including, among others, to finance acquisitions, share repurchases and capital expenditures and becomes payable in full on February 22, 2024.
Borrowings under the revolving credit facility will accrue interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin or at the base rate. The base rate is the applicable margin plus the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.500%, (ii) the Bank of America prime rate and (iii) the one-month LIBOR plus 1.000%. The applicable margin for borrowings is a percentage per annum based on the lower of (1) a pricing level determined by the Company’s then-current

consolidated leverage ratio and (2) a pricing level determined by the Company’s debt ratings (if such debt ratings exist). The revolving credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default.
The revolving credit agreement also contains a financial covenant requiring the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter (for the four-quarter period ending on such date) with an opportunity for a temporary increase in such consolidated leverage ratio to 4.00 to 1.00 upon the consummation of certain qualified acquisitions for which the aggregate consideration is at least $250 million.
