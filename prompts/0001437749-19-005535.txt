ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We harness proprietary big data predictive analytics, artificial intelligence and telehealth, combined with human interaction, to deliver improved member health and cost savings to health plans. We identify, engage and treat health plan members with unaddressed behavioral health conditions that worsen medical comorbidities. Our mission is to help improve the health and save the lives of as many people as possible.
 
We apply advanced data analytics and predictive modeling to identify members with untreated behavioral health conditions, whether diagnosed or not, and coexisting medical conditions that may be impacted through treatment in the OnTrak program. We then uniquely engage health plan members who do not typically seek behavioral healthcare by leveraging proprietary enrollment capabilities built on deep insights into the drivers of care avoidance. Our technology enabled OnTrak solution is an integrated suite of services that includes evidence-based psychosocial and medical interventions delivered either in-person or via telehealth, nurse-led care coaching and local community support. We believe that the program is currently improving member health and, at the same time, demonstrating reduced medical utilization, driving a reduction in total health plan costs for enrolled members.
 
We have contracted with leading national and regional health plans to make OnTrak available to eligible members in California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
 
We believe that our business and operations as outlined above are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations. However, the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and the criteria are often vague and subject to change and interpretation by various federal and state legislatures, courts, enforcement and regulatory authorities. Our future prospects are subject to the legal, regulatory, commercial and scientific risks outlined below and in Item 1.A “Risk Factors.”
Substance Dependence 
 
Scientific research indicates that not only can drugs interfere with normal brain functioning, but they can also have long-lasting effects that persist even after the drug is no longer being used. Data indicates that at some point, changes may occur in the brain that can turn drug and alcohol abuse into substance dependence—a chronic, relapsing, and sometimes fatal disease. Those dependent on drugs may suffer from compulsive drug craving and usage and be unable to stop drug use or remain drug abstinent without effective treatment. Professional medical treatment may be necessary to end this physiologically-based compulsive behavior.

Substance dependence is a worldwide problem with prevalence rates continuing to rise despite the efforts by national and local health authorities to curtail its growth. Substance dependence disorders affect many people and have wide-ranging social consequences. In 2016, an estimated 20.1 million adults in the United States (U.S.) met the criteria for substance dependence, according to the National Survey of Drug Use and Health.
 
We believe the best results in treating substance dependence can be achieved in programs such as our OnTrak solution that integrate psychosocial and medical treatment modalities and provide longer term support on an out-patient basis.
 
Anxiety Disorders
 
According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting an estimated 19.1% of adults aged 18 years or older. People with anxiety disorders are:

● | Three to five times more likely to go to the doctor; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | Six times more likely to be hospitalized for psychiatric disorders.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

Mood Disorders
 
In 2016, an estimated 10.3 million U.S. adults aged 18 or older, or approximately 4.3% of all U.S. adults, had at least one major depressive episode in the past year, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Patients with substance dependence and mood disorders were ranked four out of the top 10 reasons leading to readmission rates for Medicaid patients.
Our Market 
 
The true impact of behavioral health is often under-identified by organizations that provide healthcare benefits. The reality is that individuals with unaddressed behavioral health conditions that worsen chronic medical comorbidities cost health plans and employers a disproportionate amount of money.
 
When considering behavioral health-related costs, many organizations have historically only looked at direct treatment costs–usually behavioral claims. In fact, for the members we seek to engage our solution, costs associated with behavioral health treatment represent a small portion of their overall healthcare claims, while the medical costs are significant.
 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau in 2014, there were over 283 million lives in the U.S. covered by various private managed care programs, including Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs), Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), self-insured employers and managed Medicare/Medicaid programs.  Each year, based on our analysis, approximately 1.9% of commercial plan members will have a substance dependence diagnosis, and that figure may be lesser or greater for specific payors depending on the health plan demographics and location.  A smaller, high-cost subset of this population drives the majority of the claims costs for the overall substance dependent population.  For commercial members with substance dependence and a total annual claims cost of at least $7,500, the average annual per member claims cost is $30,000, compared with an average of $3,250 for a commercial non-substance dependent member, according to our research. 
 
Our Customers
 
Our customers provide health insurance to individuals or groups (Contracted Membership). We contract with our customers to provide our OnTrak solution to the customers’ Contracted Membership generally in specific lines of business (e.g., commercial, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) and/or specific states or other geographical areas and for specific indications, such as substance use disorders, anxiety and depression. We refer to the Contracted Membership to whom we are providing the OnTrak solution as Covered Lives. Generally, we receive data relating to the Covered Lives on a regular basis from our customers. We use that data to identify members who meet our contractual eligibility requirements (Eligible Members) and we attempt to engage and enroll those members in our OnTrak solution. Our Eligible Members can fluctuate significantly from month to month due to fluctuations in our customers’ Contracted Membership and changes in eligibility due to changes in claims or eligibility data provided to us by our customers. Based on our analysis of the data provided to us by our customers, approximately 2% - 3% of the adult Contracted Membership in a health plan is anticipated to be eligible for our OnTrak solution. There can be no assurance that the data we have analyzed to date will be predictive of the future or that the portion of Covered Lives that are eligible for our programs will not change in the future. In addition, the percentage of Eligible Members in any lines of Covered Lives may fluctuate substantially from period to period.

Our Solution: OnTrak™
 
Our OnTrak solution includes the identification, engagement and treatment of health plan members with unaddressed behavioral health conditions that worsen medical comorbidities. We specifically focus on members with anxiety, depression and/or substance use disorder(s). We apply claims-based analytics and predictive modeling to first identify health plan members with medical costs that may be impacted through behavioral health treatment with the OnTrak program. These members may or may not be diagnosed with a behavioral condition. We then conduct multichannel outreach to eligible members, which results in an approximate 20% annual enrollment rate. Enrolled members receive nurse-led care coaching, the opportunity to participate in telehealth or face-to-face evidence-based psychosocial and pharmacological treatment and in some cases, in-market Community Care Coordinator support. We believe the benefits of OnTrak include improved clinical outcomes and decreased costs for the payor, as well as improved quality of life for the member. We provide outcomes reporting to payors on a periodic basis to demonstrate the value of the program. Enrolled members achieve an average gross cost reduction of approximately 54% for the year after enrollment compared to the 12 months prior to enrollment.
Our Strategy
 
Our business strategy is to deliver proven, repeatable clinical and financial outcomes to health plans for their members with unaddressed behavioral conditions that worsen medical comorbidities. We do this by identifying, engaging and treating these members through our OnTrak solution. Our OnTrak solution to date has focused on substance use disorder(s), anxiety and depression.
 
Key elements of our business strategy include:

Our Operations
 
Healthcare Services
 
Our OnTrak solution combines nurse-led care coaching, innovative psychosocial and medical treatment delivered through a proprietary provider network and in-market support from Community Care Coordinators. The solution is designed to help payors treat and manage populations struggling with substance use disorder(s), depression, and anxiety to improve their health and thereby decrease their overall health care costs.
 
As of March 19, 2019, we have contracts with nine health plans, two of which have merged and are in the process of integrating operations. We are enrolling patients under all nine of these contracts.
 
We are currently marketing our OnTrak solution to payors on a case rate, monthly fee, or fee for service basis, which involves educating them on the disproportionately high cost of their population with unaddressed behavioral health conditions that exacerbate medical comorbidities, and demonstrating the potential for OnTrak to reduce these costs.
 
Competition
 
Healthcare Services
 
Our OnTrak solution to date has focused on substance dependence, anxiety and depression, and is marketed to health plans and other insurance payors. While we believe our products and services are unique, we operate in highly competitive markets. We compete with other healthcare management service organizations, care management and disease management companies, including managed behavioral health organizations (MBHOs) that manage behavioral health benefits, perform utilization reviews, provide case management and patient coaching, and pay their network of providers for behavioral health services delivered. Most of these competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. We also compete with companies that use data analytics to identify health plan members with behavioral health conditions and either provide coaching and/or therapy or match members with treatment providers. There are also several companies that use digital-only approaches to treating behavioral health conditions. Some of these competitors have secured reimbursement for their products or services from health plans.  We believe these organizations are serving a different segment of the market and do not provide an end-to-end integrated solution with financial outcomes.  We believe our product is the most comprehensive one to focus exclusively on engaging and treating members whose anxiety, depression, or substance use disorders are exacerbating co-existing medical conditions through our coaches and network of providers using specially designed treatment regimens.
 
In addition, managed care companies may seek to provide similar specialty healthcare services directly to their members, rather than by contracting with us for such services.  Behavioral health conditions, including substance dependence, are typically managed for insurance companies by internal divisions or third-parties (MBHOs) frequently under capitated arrangements.  Under such arrangements, MBHOs are paid a fixed monthly fee and must pay providers for provided services, which gives such entities an incentive to decrease cost and utilization of services by members.   Our integrated program for members with unaddressed substance dependence, anxiety, and depression increases treatment while reducing the overall health care costs of the members, versus the population utilization management programs that MBHOs offer to manage a health benefit.
 
We believe that our ability to offer customers an outcomes-based comprehensive and integrated solution, including the utilization of innovative medical and psychosocial treatments and engagement methodologies, and our network of treatment providers, will enable us to compete effectively.  However, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter more effective competition in the future, which would limit our ability to maintain or increase our business.
 
Once we contract with a third-party payor, we implement our program in conjunction with the third-party payor and then commence outreach to eligible members to enroll them in our OnTrak solution. In this enrollment process, we compete against numerous other providers of behavioral health treatment programs, facilities and providers for those members that elect to receive treatment for their behavioral health conditions (see Treatment Programs below). We believe we provide members with a more comprehensive solution, but members may choose to receive care from other providers. To the extent a member selects a different provider that is part of a health plan network of providers, the cost of such treatment may be paid in whole or in part by our health plan customer.
