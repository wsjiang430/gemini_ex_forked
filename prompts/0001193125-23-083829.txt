Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 Genelux is a late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a pipeline of next-generation oncolytic viral immunotherapies for patients suffering from aggressive and/or difficult-to-treat solid tumor types. Our most advanced product candidate, Olvi-Vec (olvimulogene nanivacirepvec), is a proprietary, modified strain of the vaccinia virus (VACV), a stable DNA virus with a large engineering capacity. We have met the preestablished endpoint for our Phase 2 clinical trial of Olvi-Vec in platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer (PRROC). Employing our proprietary selection technology and discovery and development platform (CHOICE), we have developed an extensive library of isolated and engineered oncolytic VACV immunotherapeutic product candidates. These provide potential utility in multiple tumor types in both the monotherapy and combination therapy settings, via physician- preferred administration techniques, including regional (e.g., intraperitoneal), local and systemic (e.g., intravenous) delivery routes. Informed by our CHOICE platform and supported by extensive clinical and preclinical data, we believe we have the capacity to develop a pipeline of treatment options to address high unmet medical needs for those patients with insignificant or unsatisfactory responses to standard- of-care therapies, including chemotherapies. From this library, we selected Olvi-Vec, which we believe has the potential to exhibit anti-tumor properties, including potent oncolytic properties (tumor cell lysis), and to activate both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, to produce favorable changes within the tumor microenvironment. The personalized and multi-modal immune activation generated by Olvi-Vec is designed with the goal to yield clinically-meaningful anti-tumor responses to virus treatment alone and in combination with other existing treatment modalities. We believe Olvi-Vec currently represents the most advanced clinical development program throughout the oncolytic treatment landscape involving the non-local administration (i.e., non-intratumorally) of viral immunotherapies. 
 In September 2019, we completed enrollment of a single-arm, open-label Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of Olvi-Vec in heavily pre-treated patients with PRROC. To date, the data from this trial suggests systemic anti- tumor responses to monotherapy and documented clinical responses to subsequent chemotherapy. Furthermore, no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) were reached and the most common observed adverse events were flu-like symptoms and abdominal pain. In November 2015, we completed an open- label Phase 1 clinical trial of Olvi-Vec in patients with documented progressive disease (PD) (i.e., Stage IV cancers). Our data from this study indicate changes in tumor growth rate post-Olvi-Vec treatment and that Olvi-Vec may have utility against a variety of cancers, particularly those diagnosed with lung diseases, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Furthermore, no MTD was reached and the intravenous administration of Olvi-Vec appeared well tolerated. Additionally, we completed an open-label, non-randomized Phase 1 clinical trial of Olvi-Vec in patients with solid organ cancers. Our data from this study indicated high and condensed intravenous doses of Olvi-Vec resulted in endured viral pharmacokinetics (PK) in the blood, and led to infection of and immune cell infiltration into tumor tissues. 
 Based on our clinical trial results and discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), we formally submitted our protocol to our Phase 3 registration clinical trial of Olvi-Vec in PRROC in January 2022 and made minor clarifying revisions in a protocol amendment in May 2022. We also submitted two amendments to our Investigational New Drug (IND) application in 2021 for our new in-house manufacturing process seeking to demonstrate comparability of product manufactured under our new in-house process to product used in our Phase 2 clinical trial of Olvi-Vec in PRROC. We responded to FDA comments regarding the manufacturing amendment in December 2021 and in February 2022. In July 2022, we received and responded to additional FDA comments regarding an assay used in our clinical trial. Our Phase 3 registration clinical trial of Olvi-Vec in PRROC initiated enrollment in the third quarter of 2022. 
 In September 2021, we entered into a License Agreement (the Newsoara License) with Newsoara BioPharma Co. Ltd. (Newsoara) pursuant to which we granted Newsoara an exclusive license to research, develop, commercialize or exploit Olvi-Vec in China, which includes mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and

  Macau, for all human diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic uses (Newsoara field). Under the Newsoara License, Newsoara also granted to us an exclusive and royalty bearing license to develop, commercialize and exploit outside the territory any derived products developed by Newsoara. Additionally, Newsoara is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize the licensed products in the territory in the applicable Newsoara field and is solely responsible for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with such activities. Subject to FDA authorization, we anticipate beginning regulatory study start-up of a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, and controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenously delivered Olvi-Vec oncolytic VACV followed by treatment as per the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for patients with recurrent NSCLC in the United States in the first half of 2023, which will be funded in its entirety by Newsoara. We plan to conduct this trial under our current open IND and, subject to regulatory authorization, potentially launch a multi-regional clinical trial with Newsoara in the United States and China. We further anticipate Newsoara will initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of Olvi-Vec in patients with recurrent SCLC in the first half of 2023, and thereafter initiate trials in recurrent NSCLC and recurrent ovarian cancer in China. 
 Through our CHOICE discovery platform, we have developed an extensive library of potential product candidates and plan to pursue additional oncolytic immunotherapy product(s) for human and animal health applications, either internally or through partnerships and collaborations. Importantly, our oncolytic immunotherapy product candidates are off-the-shelf personalized immunotherapies. In other words, while we administer the same virus product to different patients, the cellular immune response generated is specific to the unique neoantigens in that patient. For example, in addition to Olvi-Vec, other product candidates developed from our library include V2ACT Immunotherapy and V-VET1. We formed V2ACT Therapeutics, LLC (V2ACT), a joint venture with TVAX Biomedical Inc. (TVAX), for the purpose of V2ACT developing and commercializing a product candidate, V2ACT Immunotherapy, that combines an oncolytic virus (e.g., Olvi-Vec) and neoantigen-primed adoptive cell therapy (NACT) for cancer. 
 We believe that V2ACT Immunotherapy may offer significant advantages over other approaches to anti- cancer immune activation, such as targeted therapies that interdict a single cellular pathway or vaccines that rely upon a single antigen or a small collection of neoantigens, because the use of redundant biological pathways may overcome the therapeutic inhibition of such approaches and lead to clinical relapse. We also believe our manufacturing capacity is more cost-effective and efficient as compared to some other personalized immunotherapies that require individual product preparations at high costs for each patient. In October 2020, V2ACT filed an IND application and received authorization from the FDA for the initiation of a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial to study V2ACT Immunotherapy as a treatment for newly-diagnosed, surgically-resectable pancreatic cancer. This clinical trial is not yet scheduled to be initiated. 
 In November 2021, as amended in February 2022 and April 2022, we entered into a License Agreement (ELIAS License) with ELIAS Animal Health LLC (ELIAS) pursuant to which we granted ELIAS the exclusive, worldwide and royalty bearing license to research, develop, use, sell, offer for sale, have sold, import and otherwise commercialize any and all veterinary products that contain the oncolytic virus known as V-VET1 in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of cancer in non-human animals (the ELIAS field). Under the ELIAS License, ELIAS also granted to us an exclusive, fully paid and royalty free license to use the data and results developed by ELIAS to develop, commercialize and exploit any therapeutic virus outside the ELIAS field. Additionally, ELIAS is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop, and commercialize the licensed products, and is solely responsible for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with such activities, including all studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval for the licensed products in the ELIAS field.

 Our Strategy 
 Our strategy is to leverage our deep internal capabilities in the clinical development of oncolytic viruses to create a leading immunotherapy company, discovering, developing and commercializing next-generation products for the treatment of a broad range of cancers, including solid tumors, many of which are among the most difficult cancers to treat. We are focused on the execution and success of our clinical programs and, over time, on building our organization into a fully-integrated therapeutics company. Key elements of our strategy include: 

 | Advance our lead product candidate, Olvi-Vec, through clinical development and seek regulatory approval. We formally submitted our protocol to the FDA for our randomized, controlled Phase 3 registration clinical trial involving the intraperitoneal delivery of Olvi-Vec in approximately 186 patients with PRROC in January 2022 and made minor clarifying revisions in a protocol amendment in May 2022. Our Phase 3 registration trial of Olvi-Vec in PRROC initiated enrollment in the third quarter of 2022.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Broaden and strengthen our internal manufacturing capabilities, utilizing our in-house manufacturing facility. We have strong in-house pharmaceutical development and manufacturing capabilities and have established, equipped and are operating our own cGMP manufacturing facility in San Diego, California for multi-product cGMP manufacturing. Our facility is producing cGMP material that we intend to use in our subsequent clinical trials of Olvi-Vec and for the initial commercial launch of Olvi-Vec, if approved. We plan to continue to invest in growing our manufacturing capabilities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Support the clinical and commercial development of Olvi-Vec with our strategic partner, Newsoara, advise and coordinate the design and initiation of clinical trials in China and provide product supply and technology transfer. Subject to FDA authorization, we anticipate beginning regulatory study start-up of a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, and controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenously delivered Olvi-Vec oncolytic VACV followed by treatment as per the NCCN Guidelines for patients with recurrent NSCLC in the United States in the first half of 2023, which will be funded in its entirety by Newsoara. We plan to conduct this trial under our current open IND and, subject to regulatory authorization, potentially launch a multi-regional clinical trial with Newsoara in the United States and China. We further anticipate Newsoara will initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of Olvi-Vec in patients with recurrent SCLC in the first half of 2023, and thereafter initiate trials in recurrent NSCLC and recurrent ovarian cancer in China. Newsoara is funding all of these trials in their entirety.

 | Seek additional development and commercial collaborations for Olvi-Vec and our other human therapeutic product candidates, while retaining significant economic and commercial rights in key geographic areas. We intend to retain rights in the United States for our product candidates and to develop an oncology-focused commercial organization of internal and/or contract resources. When economically attractive, we intend to accelerate development and commercialization of, and patient access to, our product candidates by pursuing strategic partnerships with leading biopharmaceutical companies in those geographic areas where we are unlikely to pursue development and commercialization on our own.

 | Leverage our CHOICE discovery platform to build a portfolio of oncology product candidates that target a range of immune mechanisms and progress these product candidates into clinical development. We plan to continue to strengthen our leading position in the oncolytic viral immunotherapy field through ongoing product development and investments in VACV product candidates generated by our CHOICE platform. We plan to introduce into the clinic at least one next-generation oncolytic virus, aimed at further optimizing delivery and activating multiple immune mechanisms for the treatment of a broad range of cancers.

 Immuno-oncology Background and Limitations of Existing Therapies 
 Cancer is a broad group of diseases in which normal cells are transformed into a state of rapid and uncontrolled cell division, typically resulting in tumors. Cancer originates from a particular tissue in the body, such as the lung or ovary, and often spreads, or metastasizes, as the disease progresses and, if uncontrolled, can lead to death. Tumors are comprised of multiple cell types, including cancerous cells and the bodys own immune cells. The composition and the type of tumor dictate the aggressiveness of a particular cancer, its susceptibility to treatment, and ultimately, patient outcome. 
 Historically, cancer treatment has been limited to surgical removal, cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation. However, those treatments are not long-term solutions, as not all cancer cells may be killed or removed from the patient and those which remain may become resistant to standard-of-care treatment over time. 
 Another potential approach to cancer treatment is to activate the immune system by targeting specific genetic changes in individual tumors and redirecting the patients immune system to eliminate tumors. 
 The immune system contains many different cell types that fall into two general categoriescells of the innate immune system and cells of the adaptive immune system. The innate immune system is a first-line, ubiquitous, non-specific defense mechanism and involves a diverse set of cells, which generate a rapid response to any foreign body, particularly microbial pathogens and parasites, as well as tumor cells. The adaptive immune system is a second line of defense that is specific to particular foreign or mutated proteins, known as antigens, and is triggered when the innate immune system releases signals to activate and recruit cells from the adaptive immune system. The adaptive immune system is composed of T cells and B cells which can form immunologic memory and therefore be activated upon reintroduction of the initial antigens. Activation of both the innate and adaptive components of the immune system is believed to be essential for the induction of an effective anti-cancer immune response by the body. 
 Immuno-oncology therapies have been developed recently to activate or modulate the anti-cancer immune responses in some patients. Unfortunately, most patients either are not eligible for or do not respond to these therapies. For example, only about 1560% of patients respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in general, with a response rate that is lower than ten percent for certain cancer types, such as recurrent ovarian cancer or cancers with negative programmed death-ligand. While these therapies have advanced the treatment of cancer for some patients, many are still underserved. 
 Tumors have many defense mechanisms against anti-cancer therapies, which is why cancer patients often respond to initial treatment but then relapse when the tumors regrow. To overcome these defense mechanisms, it is commonly believed that multiple mechanisms of action will be required to unlock the full potential of available therapies. Given the limitations of current standards of care, whether traditional cancer therapy or newer immune-oncology therapies, there remains an urgent need for new therapeutic options that offer improved clinical outcomes for cancer patients. 
 We see a vast opportunity for therapies that stimulate robust anti-tumor responses by activating both the innate and adaptive immune systems and modifying the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by making cancer cells more receptive to subsequent treatments. This includes sensitizing cancer cells that are otherwise resistant to standard-of-care therapies. 
 Oncolytic immunotherapy is the treatment of cancer with viruses that selectively replicate in tumors but not in normal tissues. Viral immunotherapies cause immunogenic tumor cell death by way of viral oncolysis, which has the therapeutic benefit of exposing all the tumors neoantigens to the immune system. Tumor neoantigens are uniquely present in tumors, as compared to normal tissue, because they result from the genetic changes that occur as cancer develops. Immunogenic tumor cell death triggers both innate and adaptive immune responses and the establishment of lasting antitumor immunity, resulting in the further destruction of existing tumors and those that may form later. We believe that viral immunotherapies are the most promising modality available today to activate multiple arms of the immune system and improve outcomes for cancer patients.

 Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States and worldwide, exceeded only by cardiovascular disease. The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that 1.9 million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in 2022 and approximately 609,000 Americans are expected to die of cancer in 2022. This estimate excludes basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers, which are not required to be reported to cancer registries, and carcinoma in situ (noninvasive cancer) except for urinary bladder cancer. According to estimates from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), in 2020, there were approximately 19.3 million new cancer cases worldwide with a corresponding estimated number of cancer deaths of 10.0 million. 
 The death rate is expected to continue to increase despite introduction of scores of new treatments. Curative treatment requires elimination of all cancer cells, including cancer stem cells, an objective that current systemic treatments achieve only infrequently. For most patients, current systemic treatments provide incremental benefit with substantial toxic side effects. There is a significant unmet medical need for safer and more effective treatments for a wide array of human cancers. 
 The Genelux Approach 
 Oncolytic VACV 
 We utilize VACV as the backbone of our therapeutics and diagnostics platform. VACV is a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus and contains a single linear DNA genome. Like other large DNA viruses, VACV exhibits greater complexity and depends less on its host for replication than other viruses. The DNA genome of a number of strains of VACV has been sequenced and found to encode approximately 150200 proteins. VACV particles include a large number of viral enzymes and related factors that allow the virus to produce functional messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA) within the host cell cytoplasm. Therefore, VACV has a high level of independence from host cell functions with its genome encoding most of the proteins required for the production of virions, the infectious form of the virus. 
 Our approach is based on the mechanism of action of VACV, which has the following characteristics we consider desirable in an oncolytic virus for clinical applications: 
 

 | Not dependent on any known receptor and can infect nearly any type of cancer cells;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Large insertion capacity (> 25 kb) for the expression of multiple exogenous genes;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | High genetic stability;
--+------------------------


 | Lack of a known natural host;
--+------------------------------


 | Not associated with naturally-occurring disease in humans;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | Remains in the cytoplasm (mitigating its potential for mutagenesis by incorporation into the host genome);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Short, well-characterized life cycle;
--+--------------------------------------


 | Robust lytic capabilities, high replication and proliferation;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


 | Upregulates a unique profile of pro-inflammatory chemokines/cytokines and other apoptotic/cytotoxic factors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Induces a Th1-type immune (cellular) response, which is an optimal immune response for cancer killing;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Well-tolerated with low incidence of side effects when previously administered as the backbone of the vaccination campaign that eradicated smallpox;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Limited pre-existing immunity (waning over time as immunizations ended in the general population in the 1970s); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Amenable to large scale production of high levels of active virus.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Mechanism of Action 
 Oncolytic vaccinia viral immunotherapies, such as Olvi-Vec, have multiple properties that differentiate them from other anti-tumor therapies, including the ability to transform so-called immunologically cold tumors into hot tumors: 
 Viral Infection of Tumor Cells  VACV has shown a natural tropism, or an ability to productively infect a particular cell through mechanisms that are believed to contribute to the selective targeting of tumor cells as compared to normal cells. 

 | Cellular tropism refers to the observation that virus replication can be permissive, semi-permissive or abortive in cultured cells of different lineages or species. The binding and entry of poxviruses into mammalian cells is an efficient process. The intracellular events of the infected cell that affect replication efficiency of the virus include cell-cycle status, lineage and differentiation state, the availability of trans-acting transcription factors from the host, and its intrinsic antiviral state. There is evidence that mitogenically stimulated quiescent cells favor viral replication; therefore, it is expected that VACV may replicate more effectively in proliferating cells, such as tumor cells.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Tissue tropism refers to the frequently observed increased levels of virus replication in specific host organs or tissues, which can be influenced by factors that mediate cellular tropism as well as by tissue- specific antiviral responses. VACV are relatively large particles (350 nm in diameter) that require leaky vasculature (fenestrations) for transfer of the virus out of the circulation. The aberrant angiogenic signaling in tumors results in a vasculature that is leaky and tortuous. Therefore, after a systemic delivery, VACV is preferentially delivered or targeted to tumors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Amplification and Oncolysis  Once inside the tumor cells, VACV particles replicate rapidly in the cells cytoplasm. Reasons for such amplification include: 
 

 | Compromised immunosurveillance refers to the impairment of the immune processes, such as a downregulated interferon pathway, by which cells of the immune system look for and recognize foreign pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, or pre-cancerous and cancerous cells. The immunosuppressive nature of tumor tissues creates a virtual safe haven favoring the survival of VACV in the tumor tissues without immune system interference. In addition, with such defects in cellular anti-viral pathways, cancerous cells are also intrinsically susceptible to viral infection. In fact, specific defects in interferon pathway was noted as potential biomarkers for sensitivity towards oncolytic virotherapy.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Genetic modifications refer to inactivation of one or more genes of the virus genome to further enhance the favoring of VACV replication in tumor tissues over normal ones. For example, inactivation of the thymidine kinase (TK) gene forces the virus to be dependent on host cell nucleotides, which are more available in rapidly dividing tumor cells as compared to resting normal cells.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Viral replication ultimately causes tumor cell necrosis (oncolysis) and release of mature viral particles into the tumor. These newly released viral particles repeat the process by infecting and killing neighboring tumor cells. The oncolytic process can also cause bystander cell killing and viral-changes in tumor-associated vasculature. 
 Viral Particle and Tumor Antigen Release  The oncolytic process also harnesses the bodys immune system to fight the cancer. As viral particles begin destroying tumor cells, tumors release tumor antigens and tumor cell debris, including neoantigens specific to the patient, which could otherwise be hidden from the immune system. This process of necrotic cell death releases intra-cellular markers of danger, the danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), while the virus produces pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). 
 Immune Stimulation  The release of DAMPs and PAMPs activates the innate immune system through multiple pattern recognition receptors, each resulting in the production of interferon which activates natural killer cells. Innate immune activation also helps to trigger adaptive anti-cancer immunity, in which antigen presenting cells (APCs) are attracted to the infected tumor. APCs internalize cancer antigens, including neoantigens, and traffic back to the draining lymph nodes where they present the antigens to T cells. 
 Tumor Regression  The T cells are then primed to proliferate and disperse systemically to seek cancer cells with the same antigen profile throughout the body and destroy distant tumor deposits, with enhanced tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) correlated with improved survival in many solid tumor cancers. As such, while oncolysis is an important step, once anti-tumor immune stimulation and immune cell memory are developed, ongoing oncolysis (i.e., continued virus presence) is not necessary. The inflammatory cascade within the tumor microenvironment also can initiate or enhance an anti-tumor response upon subsequent administration of chemotherapies or targeted therapies.

 The following graphic demonstrates the expected mechanism of action of Olvi-Vec based on the factors described above: 
 

Given its paradigm-shifting biology, we believe that VACV has the potential to unlock the full power of viral immunotherapies and to fundamentally change the way cancer is treated. 
 Development Program 
 We are developing a pipeline of oncolytic immunotherapy clinical and preclinical product candidates with the potential to address many significant unmet medical needs in oncology. Specifically, our clinical and preclinical product candidates are intended to selectively kill tumor cells and induce a robust immune response against a patients tumor neoantigens. 
 Importantly, our oncolytic immunotherapy product candidates are off-the-shelf personalized immunotherapies. In other words, while we administer the same virus product to different patients, the cellular immune response generated is expected to be specific to the unique neoantigens in that patient. 
 We believe that our approach may offer significant advantages over other approaches to anti-cancer immune activation, such as targeted therapies that interdict a single cellular pathway or vaccines that rely upon single antigen or a small collection of neoantigens, because the use of redundant biological pathways may overcome the therapeutic inhibition of such approaches and lead to clinical relapse. We also believe our manufacturing capacity is more cost-effective and efficient as compared to some other personalized immunotherapies that require individual product preparations at high costs for each patient. 
 Our technology is broadly based on the use of genetically-engineered organisms, such as viruses, bacteria, and mammalian cells (e.g., stem cells), that deliver therapeutic and diagnostic constructs to tumors. This depth and breadth of approach allows for a deeper scientific understanding of the biological mechanisms of tumor biology and potentially allows for future discoveries and expansion of our clinical pipeline. 
 Lead Product Candidate: Olvi-Vec 
 Our current development focus is on our lead product candidate, Olvi-Vec (USAN: olvimulogene nanivacirepvec; laboratory name: GLV-1h68; previously known as GL-ONC1), a genetically stable, attenuated Lister-Institute of Viral Preparations (LIVP) strain of VACV. 
 We modified the LIVP strain by integrating three foreign gene expression cassettesRuc-GFP (a fusion gene of Renilla luciferase and green fluorescent protein); LacZ (ß-galactosidase gene from E. coli); and gusA (ß- glucuronidase from E. coli)to selectively disrupt non-essential vaccinia genes (F14.5L, thymidine kinase (TK), and hemagglutinin (HA) loci, respectively). The following table sets forth a description of the genomic modifications made to the LIVP strain.

A56R | inactivation | hemagglutinin | Reducing infectivity 
 | insertion | Ò-glucuronidase (E. coli) | High immune response; potential for enzyme-prodrug therapy 

 Clinical Development of Olvi-Vec 
 We are developing Olvi-Vec for the treatment of multiple cancers based on the results of preclinical studies that suggest Olvi-Vec has the potential to infect and directly kill a wide range of tumor cell types in vitro and in vivo and produce an anti-tumor immune response. To date, Olvi-Vec has been studied in multiple early- and mid-phase clinical trials via regional, local and systemic deliveries, as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies, in approximately 150 patients with a variety of cancer types. All of our clinical trials have yielded data that has informed our future clinical strategy and trial design involving multiple indications and methods of delivery. 
 In all of our clinical trials, irrespective of the route of administration, dosing regimen or cancer type, Olvi-Vec was: 
 

 | Observed to be well tolerated, and whether administered in a single dose or multiple doses per cycle, no MTD was reached in any of the trials and there were no significant issues with virus shedding into the environment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Shown to infect and selectively kill tumor cells, initiate an anti-tumoral response and modulate the tumor microenvironment, including re-sensitizing certain tumors to chemotherapy;

 Clinical Program Development Strategy 
 The previously conducted intraperitoneal study (NCT01443260) was a Phase 1 trial designed to test various dosing regimens and, primarily, to assess safety and tolerability and translational anti-tumor effects in a variety of solid tumors. We believed the results of the study supported advancement into our Phase 1b/2 study (NCT02759588) in resistant/refractory ovarian cancer, the results of which we believe support advancement into a Phase 3 registration clinical trial. 
 The previously conducted intravenous studies (NCT00794131; NCT01584284; NCT02714374; NCT03420430) were all Phase 1 trials designed to test various dosing regimens and, primarily, to assess safety and tolerability and translational anti-tumor effects in a variety of solid tumors. We believe the results of the studies support advancement of intravenous systemic administration of Olvi-Vec in multiple solid tumor types. Subject to FDA authorization, we anticipate beginning regulatory study start-up of a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, and controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenously delivered Olvi-Vec oncolytic VACV followed by treatment as per the NCCN Guidelines for patients with recurrent NSCLC in the United States in the first half of 2023, which will be funded in its entirety by Newsoara. We plan to conduct this trial under our current open IND and, subject to regulatory authorization, potentially launch a multi-regional clinical trial with Newsoara in the United States and China. We further anticipate Newsoara will initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of Olvi-Vec in patients with recurrent SCLC in the first half of 2023, and thereafter initiate trials in recurrent NSCLC and recurrent ovarian cancer in China. 
 The estimated enrollments of the planned systemic administration trials are set forth below. 
 

Sponsor | | Trial Sites | | Indication | | Clinical Stage | | Patients (est.) | Randomization
 | | US | | Recurrent NSCLC | | Phase II | | ~138 | 2:1 
 | | China | | Recurrent OC | | Phase I/II | | ~150 | 2:1 
 | Recurrent NSCLC | | Phase I/II | | ~150 | | 2:1 
 | Recurrent SCLC | | Phase I/II | | ~150 | | Single arm

 The previously conducted intrapleural study (NCT01766739) was a Phase 1 Investigator-initiated trial designed to test various dosing regimens and, primarily, to assess safety and tolerability and translational anti- tumor effects in a variety of solid tumors. While we believe the trial results warrant further study of the intrapleural systemic administration of Olvi-Vec, particularly in malignant pleural mesothelioma, at the present time we have determined to commit our resources to our other clinical development programs described above. 
 Ovarian Cancer Program 
 The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database estimates ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in women in the United States. According to GLOBOCAN 2020 (produced by the IARC), worldwide, there were 313,959 cases of ovarian cancer and 207,252 deaths in 2020 and worldwide, in 2018, almost 600,000 women were living within five years of an ovarian cancer diagnosis (five-year prevalence). It also predicted that by 2035 there will be a worldwide increase of annual incidence to 371,000, and an increase in deaths to 254,000. The ACS estimates in 2022 there will be approximately 19,880 new cases of ovarian cancer and approximately 12,810 deaths from the disease in the United States. The SEER database estimates in 2019 there were an estimated 233,565 women living with ovarian cancer in the United States (including those who had been cured of the disease). A majority (~80%) who respond to treatment will relapse. Median overall survival following recurrence of disease is 12 months or less with single-agent chemotherapy.

 According to GlobalData (2019), the ovarian cancer market was valued at $1.8 billion in 2018 across the seven major markets  U.S., EU5 (UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain) and Japan, and it is expected to grow to $6.7 billion in the following ten years with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.4%. North America dominates the global market for ovarian cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, and Europe is the second largest market. Asia-Pacific is expected to show high growth rates in the next few years due to the large aging population, with China and India the fastest growing markets. 
 Based on internal research and analysis, we estimate the U.S. market potential of our existing products in our initial label indication resulting from the Phase 3 registration clinical trial of Olvi-Vec in patients with PRROC to reach sales of approximately $250.0 million, at five years from marketing approval (2029). In order to estimate this initial market opportunity in ovarian cancer, which does not include the potential treatment of earlier-line patients or re- treated patients, we reviewed publicly-available data sources (e.g., SEER, Datamonitor) and identified the number of Olvi-Vec treated patients by multiplying the relevant ovarian cancer patient population (from both the annual incidences and prevalent pool) and the ovarian cancer market share for each specific year. We estimate the annual population of addressable PRROC patients in the United States to be approximately 10,000 patients. The material market assumptions for Olvi-Vec initially assume an addressable population of PRROC patients who would be eligible for treatment consistent with the expected product label resulting from our Phase 3 registration clinical trial, if successful, and who otherwise would receive platinum under current standard of care treatment. Using those assumptions, we estimate approximately 1,250 patients per year will be treated with Olvi-Vec, which will be priced at $200,000 per patient per year based on the estimates of similar products in development for this indication. With the introduction of Olvi-Vec and the anticipated re-sensitization of tumors that otherwise would not be considered eligible for platinum, we expect a change in practice and an increase in the number of addressable PRROC patients; however, our current Olvi-Vec market share assumptions do not take this into consideration. Our projections are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause them to be smaller than we currently estimate. 
 In the United States, patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer across all stages are generally treated with surgery followed by combination platinum-based chemotherapy (platinum). The majority of newly-diagnosed patients respond to platinum (so called platinum-sensitive) and many platinum-sensitive patients are eligible to receive maintenance poly-ADP ribose polymerase therapy. Unfortunately, most patients who initially respond to platinum will relapse and become resistant to further platinum therapy. Standard treatment of PRROC is largely palliative, relying on single agent non-platinum chemotherapies with or without the addition of bevacizumab. In platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, single agent therapies generally result in a 10 to 15% overall response rate (ORR), with three to four months PFS and approximately 12 months of OS. In a study of Avastin (bevacizumab) added to single agent non-platinum chemotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, sponsored by Hoffmann-La Roche, the addition of bevacizumab approximately doubles PFS; however, the 3.3 month improvement in OS (13.3 vs 16.6 months) did not reach statistical significance. The combination of non-platinum single agent therapies with bevacizumab have shown a significant increase of PFS. 
 Despite optimization of surgical and chemotherapy protocols, and initiation of clinical trials incorporating targeted therapy, the majority of patients with advanced-stage PRROC unfortunately relapse and eventually develop chemotherapy resistance. Also, importantly, common treatments continue to be associated with decreased patient quality of life due to toxicity. The treatment options for PRROC are very limited and only modest gains have been achieved in prolonging of survival of ovarian cancer. No approved therapy has been shown to significantly extend overall survival in patients with PRROC compared to standard chemotherapy. The five-year survival rate for women with Stage IV invasive epithelial ovarian cancer is only about 17%. Therefore, there is a critical unmet need to develop new therapeutic modalities that address intrinsic and acquired chemotherapy resistance in epithelial ovarian cancer. 
 A main manifestation of metastatic ovarian cancer is widespread peritoneal metastasis, which at late stage is often beyond the scope of surgery. We believe that peritoneal metastasis, because of its significant surface area and easy access in a limited space, is a potential ideal infection target for Olvi-Vec. We selected PRROC as our first registration-path indication because it represents a difficult-to-treat disease with significant unmet medical need, and intraperitoneal delivery allows for high and condensed dosing of Olvi-Vec.

 Ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer form in the same kind of tissue and are treated in the same way. These cancers are often advanced at diagnosis. Less common types of ovarian tumors include ovarian germ cell tumors and ovarian low malignant potential tumors. Epithelial ovarian cancer remains the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, owing to relatively late detection, intrinsic and acquired chemo-resistance, and relatively stable genomic makeup characterized by low mutation burden, microsatellite stable signature and infrequent PD-L1 staining. 
 Phase 1b/2 (GL-ONC1-015/AHCI Study) 
 We conducted a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of Olvi-Vec, which was administered intraperitoneally at high doses in a single round of treatment consisting of a bolus infusion on two consecutive days. Patients enrolled into the trial were heavily pretreated (with a median of four prior lines of therapy), with PD at the time of enrollment, and had PRROC, with poor responses to conventional chemotherapies. 
 In the Phase 1b portion of the clinical trial, a total of 11 patients were treated in the first two dose escalation cohorts. Olvi-Vec was observed to be well tolerated with transient overnight flu-like symptoms. Daily intravenous hydration during the treatment process relieved the symptoms and prevented dehydration. No virus- related severe organ toxicity was observed by clinical or serologic parameters and an MTD was not reached. 
 In the Phase 2 portion of the clinical trial, we implemented a cohort designed to treat patients with Olvi-Vec, at the dose of the first cohort in the Phase 1b portion, and approximately six weeks thereafter, patients were administered a chemotherapy regimen consisting of a platinum-based doublet (+/- bevacizumab). Olvi-Vec treatment was observed to be well tolerated, consistent with the previous Phase 1b results. 
 Olvi-Vec Monotherapy
The following mechanisms of action were observed: (1) Direct Lysisvirus colonized and replicated in the tumor, killing of tumor cells in ascites, and reduced circulating tumor cells; and (2) Immunotherapyvirus- induced immune activation with enhanced tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells and generation of tumor-specific T cell response (TSTcR). Killing and reduction of tumor cells, as well as a concurrent massive increase of immune cells, were confirmed by cytology analyses of ascites. 
 The following figure shows a typical tumor-cell and immune-cell dynamic observed across different patients (i.e., the tumor cell clusters in ascites fluid (abdomen) evident pre-treatment (W1D3) were cleared within days after virus infusion (W1D5, two days post-treatment), while at the same time, increasing infiltration of immune cells were observed after virotherapy (W2D10, seven days post-treatment)). This tumor-cell and immune-cell dynamic was not limited to the abdominal cavity. 
 


17 


 In an exemplary patient, a favorable and long-lasting TSTcR could still be detected at Week 30 after Olvi-Vec treatment alone as confirmed by interferon-g (IFN-g) ELISPOT assay. As shown in the following figure, this patient was heavily pretreated with nine prior lines of chemotherapy and failed the last line of pemetrexed treatment, with rapidly PD by CT scan at time of enrollment into our study. No TSTcR was detected in the patients peripheral blood mononuclear cell sample at baseline. The patient subsequently achieved objective response as partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1 criteria, measured by the significant reduction of sum of longest diameter (SLD) of the patients tumor target lesions from the Olvi-Vec monotherapy. Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1 is the standard approach to objectively measure the response of a solid tumor to treatment in adult and pediatric cancer clinical trials. RECIST 1.1 defines a complete response (CR), PR, stable disease (SD) and PD as follows: 
 

Category | Description 
Complete Response | Disappearance of all tumor lesions 
Partial Response | Reduction of >30% of the sum of target diameters 
Stable Disease | Reduction of <30% or increase of <20% of the sum of target diameters
Progressive Disease | Increase of >20% of the sum of target diameters 

 


18 


 As shown in the following figure, more importantly, we confirmed the favorable and long-lasting TSTcR in the patients blood by ELISPOT analysis coincided with the timing of objective response of PR by CT scan. 
 

Enhanced tumor infiltration and/or activity of both cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and CD4+ helper T cells has been a main aim of immunotherapy strategies and underlines the potent immune activation effect from virotherapy and its potential as an immunotherapy. In particular, the so-called immune-excluded phenotype, in which high levels of T cells and other immune cells accumulate at the tumor margin but cannot invade malignant cell nests, is generally linked to poor disease outcome, as compared to the inflamed or hot phenotype, in which intra-tumoral immune cells are abundant and get into direct apposition with neoplastic cells. 
 To investigate the influx of virus-induced CD8+ T cells into tumor tissues, multiplex immunohistochemistry analyses in paired tumor biopsies before and after virotherapy (prior to starting subsequent chemotherapy) were conducted. The following figure shows that the virus induced a large influx of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells into tumor tissues, in two representative patients. Both of these patients had recurrent cancer and achieved objective response by RECIST 1.1, with extended 11.4 and 13.0 months of PFS respectively, after subsequent platinum-based chemotherapy. 
 


19 


 While studying CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration in paired tumor biopsies by multiplex IHC, we also analyzed the number of T cells in distance relationship to the outlined tumor-stromal interface (set as 0 on the x axis) on a HALOTM infiltration histogram, with negative values of the x-axis to the left representing tumor region, and positive values to the right representing non-tumor stromal region. In five representative patients, a so-called left-shift of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells deeper into the tumor region occurred (i.e., away from stroma). The following figures show the CD8+ data described above. 
 

Clinically-significant anti-tumor effects of monotherapy were observed in both the Phase 1b and Phase portions of the trial. 
 As shown in the following figure, in the Phase 1b portion of the trial, the Clinical Benefit Rate (CR + PR + SD) was eight of 11 (73%); four out of 11 (36%) patients had a reduction in the SLD of target lesions, as confirmed by RECIST 1.1; and 17 of 38 (45%) of individual target lesions had a size reduction, with all target lesions reduced in size in the four patients with a reduction in SLD. 
 


20 


 As shown in the following figure, SD of ≥15 weeks was 55% (six out of eleven patients); and an extended PFS also was documented with 23, 35, 59 (confirmed PR) and 71 weeks of PFS, respectively, in four out of eleven patients (three in Cohort 1 and one in Cohort 2). Additionally, four patients (two in Cohort 1 and two in Cohort 2) showed more than doubling of PFS compared to the patients immediately-prior chemotherapy regimen. 
 

Olvi-Vec Primed Immunochemotherapy
Patients who received Olvi-Vec-primed immunochemotherapy demonstrated responsiveness to platinum- based therapy, which they previously were deemed resistant or refractory. As shown in in the following figure, this was documented by multiple efficacy evaluation endpoints (based on pre-chemotherapy baseline), such as ORR, as determined by RECIST 1.1 Criteria by CT scans and GCIG CA-125 Response Criteria, and durability of responses as determined by duration of response, PFS and OS. 
 Importantly, relative to historical comparisons, patients receiving Olvi-Vec-primed immunochemotherapy generally showed marked clinical benefits, particularly with respect to ORR per RECIST 1.1 (54%) with durable response, median PFS (11.0 months) and median OS (15.7 months). Historically, the expected ORR per RECIST 1.1 would be < 20%, median PFS < 3 months, and median OS < 12 months. Of note, an ORR by RECIST 1.1 of 50%, median PFS (10.8 months) was achieved in patients with platinum-refractory disease versus the historically expected ORR per RECIST 1.1 would be < 20%, median PFS < 5 months; these patients progressed during, or within one month after, receiving their most recent prior platinum-based therapy. 
 
21 


 The trial results exceeded the pre-defined threshold of 13 or more of 28 evaluable patients (minimum 43%) demonstrating an objective response by RECIST 1.1; in total, and as shown in the figure below, 13 out of 2!1 patients (54%), evaluable by RECIST 1.1, demonstrated an objective response by RECIST 1.1. 
 




22 


 In the following graphic, we show the results of three exemplary heavily pre-treated platinum-refractory (i.e., progression while on last platinum), presenting at time of enrollment with progressive disease and projected short life expectancy. All achieved PFS exceeding any of their respective prior lines, and achieved objective partial response, suggesting meaningful clinical benefit from Olvi-Vec-primed immunochemotherapy. 
 

The majority of patients treated with Olvi-Vec-primed immunochemotherapy showed clinical benefits exceeding their own last prior line of therapy (PFS of 11.0 months vs 4.5 months) with preserved or improved performance status. Historically, it is well known that patients with recurrent ovarian cancer suffer a decrease in PFS with each subsequent line of therapy. The effectiveness of subsequent lines of therapy have been described using the PFS Ratio, with any ratio greater than 1.3 considered clinically meaningful. The Kaplan-Meyer survival curves on the left show the median PFS was 4.5 months pre Olvi-Vec and 11.0 months post Olvi-Vec. The figure on the right shows that 74% of patients are on the left of the effect line, suggesting a clinically meaningful benefit following Olvi-Vec primed immunochemotherapy relative to prior lines of therapy. 
 


23 


 Importantly, the median overall survival of patients exceeded the historical survival rates of earlier lines of therapy. Additionally, 20% of patients were long-term survivors, which is generally regarded as a hallmark of clinically beneficial immunotherapies. 
 

Potential Mechanism of Action of Olvi-Vec-Primed Immunochemotherapy 
 We believe the high rate of responses and significantly prolonged PFS, in such a heavily-pretreated population with platinum-resistant/refractory disease, may be the result of mutual sensitization mechanisms between oncolytic VACV and chemotherapy/bevacizumab. 
 One such possible mechanism is so-called prime & boost, wherein Olvi-Vec may prime immune activation against tumor (neo)antigens, which is further boosted by immunogenic cell death by cytotoxic chemotherapies. 
 Combining Olvi-Vec-based immunotherapy with chemotherapy may have a particular clinical benefit against established tumors by increasing the tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune response through cross-presentation of the apoptotic tumor by subsequent cytotoxic chemotherapy, which is originally primed by virus-mediated vaccination. 
 Carboplatin/paclitaxel/gemcitabine are also known to decrease tumor-induced immune suppression by abrogating MDSC and T-reg activities. Together the immunogenic cell death and abrogation of inhibitory signals by chemotherapy deliver a strong boost to the viral primed antitumor immunity and provide a sound rationale for the clinical application of the combination regimen as virus-primed immunochemotherapy. 
 We believe the combination treatment regimen established an efficient and robust mechanism, which resulted in the observed clinical results. Specifically, the oncolytic activity of Olvi-Vec primed anti-tumor immunity by the release and immunogenic presentation of tumor antigens (including neoantigens), and of virus- encoded foreign antigens (including vaccinia viral proteins and virus-encoded transgene products) which served as functional adjuvants. Subsequent cycles of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs further generated immunogenic cell death and abrogated inhibitory signals, to deliver a strong boost to the viral-primed antitumor immunity. We believe that together, the virus-primed immunochemotherapy can potentially generate powerful and durable clinical benefits in otherwise difficult-to-treat cancer indications. 
 
24 


 Another such possible mechanism is STAT1 upregulation, wherein Olvi-Vec-mediated upregulation of STAT1 may re-sensitize resistant tumors to chemotherapy. High STAT1 protein levels, along with STAT1-induced chemokines and intra-epithelial CD8+ T cell infiltration correlate with improved chemotherapy response and better PFS in ovarian cancer. 
 We believe Olvi-Vec plays a crucial role in this process by activation of CD8+ T cells and intra-tumoral infiltration, which modifies the tumor microenvironment through both immune priming and changes of gene expression profile. CD8+ effector T cells play a key role, via activated STAT1 signaling, in abrogating stroma- mediated chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. 
 To characterize changes to the tumor microenvironment by Olvi-Vec treatment in patients, we conducted gene expression analysis by NanoString RNA profiling (PanCancer IO 360 Gene Expression Panel, including 770 genes that examine vital components involved in the complex interplay between the tumor, microenvironment and immune response in cancer) in paired (before and after virotherapy) tumor biopsies. Notably, gene expression generally associated with positive anti-tumor therapeutic effects was observed. For example, the gene expression of STAT1 of the IFN pathway was shown to be significantly upregulated (p = 0.008), which in combination with the observed virus-induced intra-tumoral influx of CD8+ T cells, together support the potential role of Olvi-Vec in abrogating platinum resistance in ovarian cancer. 
 

PRROC Development Plan: Phase 3 Registration Trial 
 We envision that Olvi-Vec-primed immunochemotherapy may overcome chemotherapy for patients with end-stage ovarian cancer that would otherwise consider palliative care or use of drugs with historically poor response rates. After an End-of-Phase 2 meeting held with the FDA in March 2021 during which we discussed the potential of our planned Phase 3 clinical trial serving as a registrational trial, we initiated a Phase 3 registration trial in PRROC. The trial is an open-label, randomized control design (2:1 randomization), enrolling patients who received their last platinum within six months from enrollment (i.e., patients who would not be responsive to platinum re-challenge). The Experimental Arm patients will receive a single cycle (two doses) of Olvi-Vec administered intraperitoneally and, approximately four weeks later, a regimen of a platinum-based doublet plus bevacizumab followed by maintenance therapy. The Active Comparator Arm patients will receive a regimen of platinum-based doublet plus bevacizumab followed by maintenance therapy. The enrollment will be approximately 186 patients.

  The following graphic summarizes the study design for the Phase 3 registration trial. 
 

We formally submitted our protocol to the FDA for our Phase 3 registration clinical trial of Olvi-Vec in PRROC in January 2022 and made minor clarifying revisions in a protocol amendment in May 2022. In December 2021 and February 2022, we responded to FDA comments on our IND amendments for our new in-house manufacturing process seeking to demonstrate comparability of product manufactured under our new in-house process to product used in our Phase 2 clinical trial of Olvi-Vec in PRROC. In July 2022, we responded to FDA comments regarding an assay used in our clinical trial. Our Phase 3 registration clinical trial of Olvi-Vec in PRROC initiated enrollment in the third quarter of 2022. 
 Systemic Administration Program 
 The intravenous administration of viral immunotherapies is an attractive approach for potentially improving the standard of care for many oncology patients because it allows for all tumors in a patient to be treated, including micro-metastases that are often difficult to detect and treat. Historically, there have been several immunologic challenges and potential limitations to the intravenous use of oncolytic viruses in clinical practice. We have generated promising data in several clinical trials studying the intravenous administration of Olvi-Vec, including over multiple cycles as a monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy. 
Phase 1 Clinical Trial (GL-ONC1-002)/MA 
 We conducted an open-label, non-randomized Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety profile and clinical activities of Olvi-Vec when administered intravenously as monotherapy to patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients were enrolled in various cohorts with different dosing regimens and different total cumulative doses. A total of 43 patients were treated. 
 All patients entered the trial with documented PD. The majority of patients presented with Stage IV cancers, and a small fraction with Stage III cancers. These patients had failed previous treatment(s) with disease progression when entering the trial. Thirteen patients from early to later dose cohorts had radiographic evidence of SD by computerized tomography (CT) scans from 8, 12, 13, 24 weeks and up to 48 weeks as compared to baseline tumor imaging. 
 Clear changes in tumor growth rate post Olvi-Vec treatment were documented by CT scans. In such cases, patients failed previous therap(ies) with PDs, but experienced significant reduction in tumor growth after receiving Olvi-Vec treatment. OS was compared in patients with PD or with SD. A statistically significant difference (p = 0.024) was documented between the two groups, indicating a potential clinical benefit of Olvi-Vec therapy in the group of patients who entered the trial with PDs. The intravenous administration of Olvi-Vec was observed to be well tolerated and MTD was not reached in this trial. 
 Tumor colonization
Viral colonization in tumor biopsies were confirmed by immunohistochemistry.

 Transient elevation of anti-tumor cytokines/chemokines and biomarkers
To elucidate immune stimulation from intravenous-delivered Olvi-Vec, we conducted immune analyses of cytokine levels at Day 8 after treatment compared to baseline levels. Overall, the data from this trial showed a profile of proinflammatory response. 
 There was an elevated level of various proteins involved in inflammation and Th-1 type related immune response, including acute-phase reactants, cytokines, and chemokines. Several IFN-g or interleukin-1 (IL-1)- induced proteins were significantly increased after virus treatment, including IP-10, ITAC, MCP-2 or MCP-4 (induced by IL-1 and TNFa), in addition to an increase in the interferon gamma-inducing factor, IL-18, all indirectly indicating an elevation in IFN gamma and IL-1 levels after virus treatment. 
 Increase of CD4+ and CD8+ cell populations
We investigated the potential impact of a peripheral blood mononuclear cells immune cell response on the therapeutic responses to Olvi-Vec. We included only the evaluable patients in the analysis, by looking at the relationship between the change from baseline for each peripheral blood mononuclear cell subset population and the responses to the Olvi-Vec treatment. Six of the seven patients with SD showed an increase in the CD4+CD69+ cell population (newly activated CD4+ cells) on Day 8 after Olvi-Vec treatment, whereas patients with PD did not show a major difference in concentration of these cells between baseline and Day 8 (p = 0.028). Similarly, there was a trend (p = 0.13) in elevated CD8+CD3+CD69+ cells (newly activated CTLs) in patients with SD compared to patients with PD. Interestingly, a drop in CD19+ cell population (B-lymphocytes) was observed in six out of seven SD patients, while out of ten patients with PD, five showed reduced B lymphocyte levels, two did not have any changes and three showed increased levels of this cell type. 
 Infection of Circulating Tumor Cells 
 We used the CellSearch system to analyze the blood of selected patients after Olvi-Vec administration, allowing detection by GFP fluorescence of circulating tumor cells which were infected with Olvi-Vec. 
 Clinical benefit in patients with pre-existing anti-vaccinia virus antibody titers 
 We examined the possible relationship of the baseline value of anti-vaccinia virus antibody titer and the anti- tumor activity of Olvi-Vec. Patients enrolled into this trial had failed previous line(s) of treatment with PD. Twenty seven of the 43 patients treated were evaluable by CT, and 13 of them showed SD for at least 12 to 24 weeks post treatment. The other 14 patients had PD by Week 12. We grouped these patients into those that received low, mid and high doses of virus, and examined how baseline anti-vaccinia titer (NAb) may or may not have affected their SD or PD status post treatment. We found that the anti-vaccinia virus titer does not plateau until around eight days after the first virus dose and does not continue to increase after repeated virus injections. 
 Only at the mid-dose level did we find that there was a statistically significant difference on baseline Nab between patients with SD or PD, which indicates that the baseline NAb affected the outcome of viral therapy. At the mid-dose level, patients with low to nonexistent baseline NAb tended to have SD, and patients with high baseline NAb tended to have PD (p = 0.007). At low-dose levels, lower baseline NAb titer does not significantly correlate to SD status and higher baseline NAb does not signal PD status (p = 0.18). This is understandable because such low doses are most likely sub-therapeutic. When high doses of virus were given, there was no statistical difference (p = 0.74). This tells us that high doses of virus may effectively neutralize the NAb, regardless of the pre-existing baseline NAb level, and therefore the existence of baseline NAb titer does not pose significant inhibition to viral therapy or forecast poor response. 
 Dose-dependent clinical benefit
Olvi-Vec, intravenously administered over months of time, as a monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors, with no standard of care option, showed a virus-dose-dependent clinical benefit on OS from multiple intravenous cycles. For purposes of the analyses below, virus dose is expressed in total cumulative dose received in all cycles in each patient. As stated above, 43 patients with advanced solid tumors were treated in this study. 
 
27 


 In the following figure, we show that, of the 43 patients, the 21 who received the lowest cumulative dose had a median OS of 6.2 months and the 23 who received the highest cumulative dose had median OS of 9.7 months. The results show a trend of OS favoring the higher-dose group. 
 

In the following figure, we further show the results of the 22 evaluable patients within the total treated population, with intractable primary lung cancers and/or lung metastases of other tumor types. In Graph 1, we show that, of the 22 patients, the 11 patients who received the lowest cumulative dose had a median OS of 4.6 months and the other 11 patients who received the highest cumulative dose had median OS of 16.8 months. The results show a statistically significant OS benefit favoring the higher-dose group (p = 0.026). In Graph 2, when we further extend the analysis, of the 22 patients, the five patients who received the lowest cumulative dose had a median OS of 4.6 months and the 11 who received the highest cumulative dose had median OS of 20.9 months. The results show a statistically significant OS benefit favoring the higher-dose group (p = 0.002).

 Data from this study suggest that Olvi-Vec may have activity against a variety of cancers, particularly with lung disease from either primary lung cancer or lung metastases from other cancer types, when intravenously administered initially prior to immune activation and potentially thereafter for multiple cycles. 
 Phase 1 Clinical Trial (GL-ONC1-011/UCSD)
We conducted an open-label, non-randomized Phase 1 clinical trial, which administered Olvi-Vec intravenously on multiple consecutive-days in a single cycle, as neoadjuvant treatment to patients with solid organ cancers prior to undergoing surgery. The objective of this study was to test a more aggressive dosing protocol in solid tumor patients by intravenously delivering high doses of virus on consecutive days in a single cycle from one week to one month prior to surgery. The intent was to obtain and analyze biological samples from the patients. As the surgeries were for curative intent, anti-tumor activity data was not obtained. The IV treatment was shown to be well tolerated and no DLTs were reported. 
 Neutralizing antibody dynamics suggest optimum dosing regimen
Anti-vaccinia antibody (NAb) levels were measured in blood before and after Olvi-Vec treatments. Substantial levels of NAb were detected by Day 8 in three out of five patients (NAb were low at Day 5 in two of these three patients), and were not reached in the other two patients at that time point. Therefore, these data indicate that there may be a window of opportunity for at least five days to allow condensed intravenous delivery of virus (e.g., consecutive days; even multiple doses per day) without significant neutralization effect from anti- vaccinia NAb. In one patient where long-term follow-up data was available, the Nab level dropped back to a low, near-baseline, level by six months post treatment. This data suggests that repeat dosing over extended time periods is possible. Overall, we believe the data described above indicates that a four-consecutive-day treatment schedule may balance efficiency of virus delivery and convenience of scheduling at the clinic. 
 Since patients received virus under neoadjuvant setting prior to surgery, primarily for curative intent, we were not able to determine therapeutic responses to Olvi-Vec among these patients. Nevertheless, data from this study suggest that high and condensed (up to five consecutive days) intravenous doses of Olvi-Vec result in endured viral pharmacokinetics in the blood and lead to infection of and immune cell infiltration into tumor tissues. 
 Expanded Access Program (GL-ONC1-021/AHCI)
We conducted an open-label, non-randomized expanded access study at Advent Health Cancer Institute, during which Olvi-Vec was administered on multiple consecutive-day intravenous doses in a single cycle to patients with advanced cancers and no standard of care or eligibility for other clinical trials and who otherwise would be provided hospice care. 
 The intravenous treatment was shown to be well tolerated. Since patients received virus under an expanded access protocol, biological sampling was limited, and tumor biopsy materials were not collected. 
 Clinically-significant anti-tumor effects were observed in two of three solid tumor patients who received Olvi-Vec-primed immunochemotherapy, with results pending for a fourth patient currently undergoing treatment. Case reports for the two patients who had clinically-significant results are set forth below. 
 

 | Case Report Patient #21A-04: A high-grade pancreatic cancer patient with lung and liver metastases received five consecutive daily intravenous doses of Olvi-Vec. The patient achieved a 59% drop of the cancer biomarker CA19.9 and an objective PR (38% target lesion size reduction from pre-Olvi-Vec baseline) per RECIST 1.1 documented by CT scans from intravenous Olvi-Vec monotherapy, as depicted in the figure below, with a PFS of 18 weeks. After subsequent disease progression, the patient then received subsequent chemotherapy and again achieved a PR (-30% target lesion size reduction from pre-chemo baseline) by RECIST 1.1, with 83% drop of CA 19.9, and PFS of 31 weeks.

 | Case Report Patient #21A-06: A patient with terminal recurrent metastatic cervical cancer with metastases in the lung also received five consecutive daily intravenous doses of Olvi-Vec. The patient had disease progression with multiple bilateral pulmonary tumor nodules increased in size compared with the prior exam at time of enrollment. Following Olvi-Vec treatment, the first CT scan at six weeks after treatment revealed growth arrest of her tumor lesions; her disease was stable for 24 weeks. The patient then went on to receive platinum doublet and bevacizumab after virotherapy and was assessed by the investigator to have had a PR to treatment. PFS for this patient was for 70 weeks, and her ongoing OS is at 36+ months with excellent performance status. Her current treating medical oncologist has recommended to again consider Olvi-Vec virotherapy when needed.

 Data from this trial suggest that Olvi-Vec-primed immunochemotherapy may have utility when administered intravenously in cancers beyond ovarian and in combination with therapies beyond platinum-based regimens. 
 Olvi-Vec-Primed Immunochemotherapy for the Treatment of Recurrent Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) 
 The first indication we intend to pursue through intravenous administration is recurrent NSCLC. NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for 80-85% of all lung cancer diagnoses. The most common types of NSCLC are squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma. Metastatic NSCLC has a poor prognosis. For example, the five-year OS rate for Stage IV NSCLC patients is less than five percent. Survival was similar in the recurrent diseases regardless of stage at diagnosis, with median OS of 6.6 months for Stage I, 6.7 months for Stage II, and 6.9 months for those with initial Stage III disease. Patients with de novo or recurrent Stage IV disease have median OS of 4.9 months. 
 Patients experiencing a recurrence of, or with advanced NSCLC, have few treatment options and are treated with chemotherapy or precision cancer medicines. The most commonly used regimens include either cisplatin or carboplatin; combined with one of several other drugs approved for the treatment of NSCLC; pemetrexed, paclitaxel, docetaxel, gemcitabine, irinotecan, or vinorelbine. Bevacizumab or ramucirumab in combination with the chemotherapy drugs paclitaxel and carboplatin, is FDA-approved for the first-line treatment of advanced, non-squamous NSCLC. 
 Despite advances in treatment and management of recurrent advanced NSCLC, NSCLC represents a high unmet medical need and novel therapies are needed to improve therapeutic outcomes, especially in patients who do not have driver mutations for targeted therapies and/or immunotherapy, or who have developed resistance to their previous treatment(s). According to Datamonitor (2021), the market for NSCLC is expected to reach $39.0 billion by 2029 in the seven major markets (U.S., EU5 and Japan). The growth of the NSCLC market will be driven partly by increasing incident cases, as the population ages. In addition, premium-priced immuno- oncology and targeted pipeline agents are expected to drive the uptake of new therapies and prolong the duration of treatment in the first-line and beyond. Based on our internal research and analysis of publicly-available data sources, we estimate the U.S. market potential of our existing products, with a label expansion in recurrent NSCLC, to at least $1.0 billion in 2029. Our projections are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause them to be smaller than we currently estimate. 
 Recurrent NSCLC Development Plan: Phase 2 Clinical Trial 
 We selected recurrent NSCLC as our first registration-path indication for intravenous delivery of Olvi-Vec-primed immunochemotherapy because of the promising data generated in patients with lung disease (primary or metastatic) in our GL-ONC1-002/MA and GL-ONC1-021/AHCI clinical trials. We believe intravenous delivery of Olvi-Vec to the lung, unlike other viruses that are administered intra-tumorally and that are less amenable to repeat injections, is particularly compelling because of the first pass effect (i.e., after administration the virus reaches the heart and is then first transported to the lungs). In preclinical studies, we have repeatedly observed the eradication of distal pulmonary metastases from multiple tumor types by intravenously administered Olvi-Vec virus. 
 Subject to FDA authorization, we anticipate beginning regulatory study start-up of a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, and controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenously delivered Olvi-Vec oncolytic VACV followed by treatment as per the NCCN Guidelines for patients with recurrent NSCLC in the United States in the first half of 2023, which will be funded in its entirety by Newsoara. We plan to conduct this trial under our current open IND and, subject to regulatory authorization, potentially launch a multi-regional clinical trial with Newsoara in the United States and China. We further anticipate Newsoara will initiate a Phase 1 study of Olvi-Vec in patients with recurrent SCLC in the first half of 2023, and thereafter initiate trials in recurrent NSCLC and recurrent ovarian cancer in China.

Additional Potential Indications for Olvi-Vec 
 We believe our preclinical and clinical data support the broad development of Olvi-Vec in patients with liquid or (metastatic) solid tumors, as a monotherapy or in combination with other therapies. Our current plan is to expand our clinical development program by pursuing additional indications via intravenous delivery. Other indications will be selected from the balance of more than 20 major human cancers against which Olvi-Vec has shown activity in preclinical studies, including blood (other leukemia/lymphoma), breast, colon, kidney, lung, prostate and skin (melanoma) cancers. 
 For example, one program expansion may be to conduct a basket trial of Olvi-Vec in patients who are either refractory and/or intolerant to standard of care and who have primary lung cancer or who have lung tumors metastatic from other primary tumors such as breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, sarcoma, bladder cancer, neuroblastoma and Wilms tumor. 
 A second program expansion may include clinical trials to assess the potential therapeutic benefit of Olvi-Vec in frontline settings, such as in ovarian cancer. In that regard, we have observed the potential benefits of combining Olvi-Vec with platinum compounds in preclinical studies, and in a completed Phase 1 clinical trial combining Olvi-Vec with cisplatin and radiation as front-line therapy in newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients. Olvi-Vec was well tolerated and demonstrated favorable trends in PFS and OS. 
 We believe that the potential to induce immune responses may represent an important mechanism to control tumor growth, prevent the spread of tumors, improve the ability to surgically remove tumors and perhaps reduce the need for surgery, and reduce or delay the onset of relapse. 
 We may also pursue additional indications via regional delivery. Potential indications include appendiceal, colorectal and gastric cancers, other gynecologic malignancies, and peritoneal mesothelioma. 
 License Agreement with Newsoara 
 In September 2021, we entered into a License Agreement (the Newsoara License) with Newsoara BioPharma Co. Ltd. (Newsoara) pursuant to which we granted Newsoara an exclusive license to research, develop, commercialize or exploit (i) any and all oncolytic viruses that are controlled by us, including Olvi-Vec but excluding V-VET1 (licensed viruses); (ii) any pharmaceutical product in final form that is comprised of or 
 
32 


 contains the licensed viruses as an active ingredient (licensed products); (iii) any virus developed by or behalf of Newsoara that (a) has a vaccinia virus backbone; (b) is not disclosed or covered by any of our patents; and (c) includes modifications (as compared to the licensed viruses) of a gene function with therapeutic intent (derived molecules); and (iv) any pharmaceutical product in final form that is comprised of or contains derived molecule as an active ingredient (derived products), in each case in China (the territory, which includes mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau) for all human diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic uses (the Newsoara field). The license granted to Newsoara is royalty bearing for licensed products and royalty free for derived products. Under the Newsoara License, Newsoara also granted to us an exclusive and royalty bearing license to develop, commercialize and exploit outside the territory any derived products developed by Newsoara. 
 Under the terms of the Newsoara License and to date, we have received from Newsoara an aggregate of $5.0 million as an upfront payment. Newsoara paid an additional $6.0 million milestone upon the FDAs authorization of our Phase 3 clinical trial for ovarian cancer. Additionally, Newsoara is obligated to pay us additional development and commercial milestone payments up to $160.5 million in the aggregate upon the occurrence of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones by the licensed products, and royalties on net sales of the licensed products in the mid-single-digit to mid-teens percentage range (the Newsoara Royalty). The Newsoara Royalty term, with respect to a licensed product and each region in the territory, is the period beginning on the date of first commercial sale of such licensed product in such region and ending on the last to occur of: (a) the expiration of the last to expire patent controlled by us (including any applicable patent term extension) in such region that contains either (i) an issued valid claim that covers the licensed product (including the licensed virus contained therein, and including the composition of matter and method of making and using thereof) or (ii) a pending valid claim that covers the sequence of the licensed virus contained therein; (b) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such region; and (c) the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity for such licensed product in such region. 
 If we, at our discretion, elect to develop and commercialize outside the territory any derived product developed by Newsoara, we are required to make certain milestone and royalty payments to Newsoara. 
 The partnership is managed by a four-member management committee that has equal representation from us and Newsoara. In the event of a dispute at the management committee level, Newsoara will have the final decision- making authority with respect to all matters concerning the development, manufacture or commercialization of the products for the Newsoara field in the territory and we shall have the right to veto any decision by Newsoara that would result in a substantial adverse effect on the products outside the Newsoara field and/or territory. 
 Newsoara is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize the licensed products in the territory in the applicable Newsoara field and is solely responsible for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with such activities. In addition, Newsoara is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct a multi-center Phase 2 clinical trial for Olvi-Vec in NSCLC using clinical sites in the United States and China and Newsoara will be responsible for the cost of such trial. Newsoaras development work will be initially focused on Olvi-Vec, and Newsoara may not develop any derived product in NSCLC or PRROC until either Olvi-Vec has been approved in such indication in the territory or the development of Olvi-Vec in such indication has been abandoned by the parties. 
 Unless terminated earlier, the Newsoara License will continue on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until expiration of the Newsoara Royalty. Each party may terminate the Newsoara License for the uncured material breach of the other party or in the case of bankruptcy of the other party. In addition, we may terminate the Newsoara License if Newsoara challenges any of the licensed patents, and Newsoara may terminate the Newsoara License for convenience with a specified prior notice period. 
 Virus and Neoantigen-primed Adoptive Cell Therapy (V2ACT Immunotherapy) 
 V2ACT Immunotherapy is a proprietary, indication-agnostic personalized immunotherapy designed to safely maximize the number and effect of cancer neoantigen-specific effector T cells within cancer tissues. It combines immunotherapeutic modalities, neoantigen-primed effector T cell immunotherapy (NACT) and oncolytic immunotherapy (initially, Olvi-Vec), each of which is supported by extensive preclinical and clinical proof-of-concept data, including Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, in various cancer indications. V2ACT Immunotherapy will be developed by V2ACT, a joint venture with TVAX and us. 
 
33 


 Immunotherapies can be subcategorized into 1) cytokines (e.g., Interleukin 2, Interferon beta); 2) vaccines (e.g., Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, Sipuleucel-T); 3) ICIs (e.g., ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab); 4) oncolytic viruses (e.g., T-Vec); and 5) adoptive CAR T cell transfer (e.g., Yescarta). Each has had significant therapeutic success in certain patient populations and the listed examples are FDA-approved products. It is generally believed that combinations of immunotherapies could broaden their applicability and increase overall efficacy. 
 V2ACT Immunotherapy is designed to combine the benefits of agents from four of the five subcategories. Neoantigen-specific adoptive T cell therapy and Olvi-Vec employ different and potentially synergistic mechanisms for cancer cell killing and prolonging patient survival. Adoptive transfer of cancer neoantigen- specific effector T cells has proven to be an effective treatment for multiple cancers. Reducing cancer tissue associated immunosuppression could increase the anti-cancer effects of adoptively transferred neoantigen- specific effector T cells. In addition to lysing cancer cells, Olvi-Vec induces an acute inflammatory response within cancer tissue that modulates the immune microenvironment in a way that would be anticipated to enhance the effects of adoptively transferred neoantigen-specific effector T cells. 
 The following diagram sets forth the potential synergistic use and mechanism of action of V2ACT Immunotherapy: 
 

The scientific rationale for V2ACT Immunotherapy is as follows: 
 

 | Patients cancer is surgically removed. Surgery performed for clinical benefit removes cancer tissue for manufacture of an attenuated autologous cancer cell vaccine.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Vaccination series to generate neoantigen-primed T cells. Vaccination with the patients own neoantigen-containing cancer cells combined with a powerful immunological adjuvant generates an immune response that produces high numbers of primed cancer neoantigen-specific effector T cell precursors in the patients body.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
34 


 
 | Harvest enriched T cells from blood. Immune cells obtained from a blood draw are stimulated with T cell activators ex vivo to convert neoantigen-specific effector T cell precursors into effector T cells and increases their numbers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Infuse oncolytic VACV. Olvi-Vec selectively enters cancer tissue and i) kills cancer cells; ii) generates an immunostimulatory acute inflammatory response, a hot spot that increases receptivity to the anti- cancer effects of adoptively transferred neoantigen-specific effector T cells; and iii) boosts anti-cancer immune responses.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Re-infuse personalized killer T cells. Ex vivo-activated neoantigen-specific effector T cells are carried to cancer tissue throughout the body, enter cancer tissue and initiate a cascade of immunological events that produce cancer cell killing, which are propagated with a course of low-dose interleukin 2 to stimulate continued multiplication of the infused cancer neoantigen-specific effector T cells.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neoantigen-primed Adoptive Cell Therapy (NACT) 
 In addition to Olvi-Vec, NACT is the other component of V2ACT Immunotherapy. 
 Following successful completion of preclinical studies, Phase 1/2a proof-of-concept studies of NACT were performed in humans. Those studies were conducted under an investigator-initiated, university-sponsored IND and an IND sponsored by TVAX. 
 Patients vaccinated with an attenuated autologous cancer cells and an immunological adjuvant generally produced a detectable immune response across a wide variety of cancer types in these studies. Specifically, 130 patients were vaccinated twice with 107 live attenuated autologous cancer cells and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Patients were tested for generation of adaptive T cell-mediated immune responses using delayed-type hypersensitivity skin testing with attenuated autologous cancer cells. The average percent positivity was 89% + 3% (estimated mean ± standard error). The following table sets forth the results of this study: 
 


35 


 In a single-arm Phase 2a clinical trial, metastatic renal cell cancer patients were treated with the combination of attenuated autologous cancer cell/immunological adjuvant vaccination and adoptive cell therapy of T cells activated ex vivo with anti-CD3 and a T cell proliferation-stimulating cytokine. The objective clinical response rate was 25% (5PR, 4CR) and all nine patients were long-term survivors. The following figure sets forth the results of this trial relative to historical control data. 
 

Pancreatic Cancer Development Plan: Phase 1/2a Trial 
 According to GlobalData (2021), pancreatic cancer has a global incidence of 495,773 cases annually, with 466,003 deaths attributable. From 2014 to 2018, the worldwide five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer increased two percent to nine percent. The ACS estimates in 2022 there will be 62,210 new cases of pancreatic cancer and 49,830 will die from the disease in the United States. According to GLOBOCAN 2020, the market for pancreatic cancer in the eight major markets (U.S., EU5, Japan and urban China) is expected to increase to $4.1 billion in 2029 at a moderate compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.2%. 
 Pancreatic cancer can develop from two kinds of cells in the pancreas: exocrine cells and neuroendocrine cells, such as islet cells. Survival is significantly better for patients with locally advanced disease (median survival 915 months) than for those with metastatic disease (three to six months). Unfortunately, pancreatic cancer often presents late and only a portion of patients with pancreatic cancer have disease at time of presentation that can be surgically resected with an expectation that surgery will generate clinical benefit. 
 Chemotherapy, primarily gemcitabine, is the mainstay of treatment for patients with advanced disease. Importantly, the targeted therapies and checkpoint inhibitor therapies that have demonstrated efficacy in some other forms of cancer have provided minimal benefit in pancreatic cancer. Despite advances in surgical and medical treatment of pancreatic cancer there has been a minimal improvement in the five-year survival rates. 
 In October 2020, V2ACT received an IND authorization from the FDA for the initiation of a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial to study V2ACT Immunotherapy as a treatment for newly diagnosed, surgically-resectable pancreatic cancer. This clinical trial is not yet scheduled to be initiated. The trial is designed to enroll 25 patients. All patients will have surgery to remove all or a portion of their primary cancer. The patients then will receive V2ACT Immunotherapy. This Phase 1/2a study is designed to obtain preliminary safety and efficacy data on this combination in order to design a larger Phase 2b clinical trial. The following graphic summarizes the study design for the planned Phase 1/2a clinical trial.

 Preclinical Studies of Olvi-Vec 
 Our preclinical studies demonstrate Olvi-Vec has the potential to infect and directly kill a wide range of tumor cell types in vitro and in vivo and produce an anti-tumor immune response. Our preclinical animal data show regression and elimination of the more than 20 major liquid and solid cancer types tested in preclinical models, including some of those deemed very difficult to treat, such as having known chemo-resistance or radio-resistance. We have also demonstrated the combination of oncolytic immunotherapy and clinically used chemo-, immuno-, and radio-therapies have the potential to enhance outcomes. 
 In vitro Cytotoxicity Studies 
 In a preclinical study conducted with the National Institutes of Health, we demonstrated the virus can replicate in a large panel of cell lines of different cancer types. We also have shown in many in vitro cytotoxicity studies that Olvi-Vec can infect and replicate more efficiently in human tumor cells than in normal cells. For example, we conducted in vitro cell culture experiments to test the tumor-cell killing (plaque forming) efficiency of Olvi-Vec in a fibrosarcoma cell line compared to the plaque forming efficiency in primary dermal fibroblasts. We showed a preferential infection and killing of fibrosarcoma tumor cells as compared to the noncancerous primary dermal fibroblasts. 
Preclinical Studies (GLV-1h68) 
 Based on preclinical studies of Olvi-Vec (Lab name: GLV-1h68), we believe Olvi-Vec not only has the potential to enhance the anti-tumor effect of chemotherapies and radiation therapies, but also immunotherapies such as cellular and targeted therapies (e.g., immune checkpoint inhibitors and co-stimulatory molecules). 
Lymphoma: Effect of VACV with Immune-modulating Checkpoint Inhibitor Following Local Tumor Irradiation 
 We examined the activity of a proprietary VACV (GLV-6b500), as both a single agent and as a combination agent with a checkpoint inhibitor and radiation, in a syngeneic animal model of hematologic malignancies to simulate advanced lymphoma. Murine lymphoma A20 cells were injected subcutaneously on bilateral flanks of BALB/c mice and treatment initiated on day 17 to only the right flank tumor with local irradiation, intra-tumoral VACV (Irr-VACV) and intra-tumoral anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody (Irr-VACV-CTLA4). The Irr-VACV- CTLA4 regimen was most effective in eradicating or shrinking not only the treated tumor but also the non-treated tumor and extending survival, followed by the Irr-VACV regimen. 
CHOICE Discovery Platform 
 Our proprietary CHOICE discovery platform is the foundation of our oncolytic immunotherapy product development program and is designed to allow us to develop new product candidates rapidly from conception through the initiation of clinical trials. The discovery platform is based on our collection of various strains of VACV based on multiple selection criteria, both in vitro (e.g., viral replication rate, plaque size, transgene expression efficiency, etc.) and in vivo (e.g., viral titer, antitumor activities, safety, etc.). 
 Through genetic engineering, recombinant strains have been generated to carry single or multiple exogenous therapeutic and/or diagnostic gene expression cassette(s) under different synthetic or natural promoters to regulate the timing and strength for transgene expression. We can generate custom-made viruses based on desired transgene(s) and specific parental viral strain, designed to optimize safety by reducing toxicity, tumor selectivity and desired diagnostic and/or therapeutic potential, e.g., to act at several key points in the pathways involved in the initiation of an immune response. 
 
39 


 We have generated an extensive portfolio of oncolytic vaccinia immunotherapy clinical candidates. We have made over 500 different versions of the VACV armed with greater than 110 transgenes, having a variety of engineered attributes, including immune modulatory and cell killing properties. We intend to develop one or more therapies derived from this platform to address multiple types of tumors, utilizing transgenes such as those set forth in the following table: 
 

Leveraging the knowledge and experience gained through the development of Olvi-Vec, we intend to nominate at least one additional product candidate after initiating and establishing our Phase 3 registration trial in ovarian cancer and our Phase 2 clinical trial in NSCLC, and to begin IND-enabling toxicology studies following nomination. 
 Selection criteria for nomination of next product candidate(s) will be based in part on our current and future preclinical and clinical experience with Olvi-Vec. We will evaluate our clinical candidates based on preclinical observations in animal model demonstrations that these viruses can more effectively lyse tumor cells, stimulate the immune system and/or enhance the ability to reach tumor sites after intravenous administration, including repeated dosing. 
 Our Animal Health Program 
 Cancer is the leading cause of death for dogs and the number one pet health concern for dog owners in the United States. In addition to surgery, currently available canine cancer treatment typically provides limited survival benefit. 
 The National Cancer Institutes Center for Cancer Research Comparative Oncology Program has reported that as many as six million pet dogs and six million pet cats are diagnosed with cancer annually in the United States. The veterinary oncology market is estimated to reach $909.4 million by 2026, with North America expected to hold a dominant position. 
 V-VET1 (Laboratory name: LIVP6.1.1), our lead animal health product candidate, is a genetically characterized, veterinary-grade replication-competent oncolytic VACV that is a naturally-attenuated isolate. 
 
40 


 V-VET1-001/CVS (Canine Veterinary Oncology Study) 
 We conducted a canine cancer study in which V-VET1 was administered as a single intravenous dose in multiple cycles to a total of 11 canine patients. 
 We did not observe any significant treatment related hematologic toxicities at any time. There was no report of skin rash from any dogs, and no report of horizontal transmission of virus. Samples were negative from canine patients who had nasal and lesion swabs taken post-virus administration and tested by viral plaque assay. One dog in the highest dose level cohort had oral swabs taken at ten minutes post-administration of virus injection and virus was detected on Cycle 1, Day 3 and Cycle 2, Day 1. No MTD was reached in this dose-escalation trial, even at the highest dose (3 × 109 pfu/25 kg body weight) out of four dose levels tested. 
 The following tables summarizes the individual best overall responses for the 11 evaluable canine patients. 
 

Tumor Type | Total # of Dogs | | Best Overall Response
Mast Cell Tumor | | 2 | | 1 PR /1 SD 
Osteosarcoma | | 2 | | 2 SD 
Soft Tissue Sarcoma | | 4 | | 3 SD /1 PD 
Anal Gland Carcinoma | | 2 | | 2 SD 
T Cell Lymphoma | | 1 | | 1 PR 
Overall Response | | 11 | | 2 PR /8 SD /1 PD

PR = Partial Response / SD = Stable Disease / PD = Progressive Disease 
 Overall, evidence of antitumor responses and disease control was documented in patients with different tumor types. Two objective responses (PR) in lymphoma and mast cell tumor, respectively, were documented among these patients, with an ORR of 18% and disease control rate (CR+PR+SD) of 91% (ten out of 11). 
 License Agreement with ELIAS 
 In November 2021, as amended on February 2022 and April 2022, we entered into a License Agreement (ELIAS License) with ELIAS Animal Health LLC (ELIAS) pursuant to which we granted ELIAS the exclusive, worldwide and royalty bearing license to research, develop, use, sell, offer for sale, have sold, import and otherwise commercialize any and all veterinary products that contain the oncolytic virus known as V-VET1 in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of cancer in non-human animals (the ELIAS field). Under the ELIAS License, ELIAS also granted to us an exclusive, fully paid and royalty free license to use the data and results developed by ELIAS to develop, commercialize and exploit any therapeutic virus outside the ELIAS field. 
 Under the terms of the ELIAS License, ELIAS is obligated to pay us certain development and sale milestones and to pay royalties in the mid single-digit percentage range on net sales of the licensed products (the ELIAS Royalty). The ELIAS Royalty term will continue, on a country-by-country basis, until the latest of: (i) the 10th anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country; (ii) the expiration of the last-to- expire valid claim in the licensed patents in such country that covers such product (including the composition of matter, manufacture or use of such product or any component therein); and (iii) the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country. 
 ELIAS is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop, and commercialize the licensed products, and is solely responsible for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with such activities, including all studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval for the licensed products in the ELIAS field. We and ELIAS created a technology transfer plan to enable ELIAS to initiate the development and manufacturing of the licensed products in the ELIAS field. At this time, we are completing technology transfer of V-VET1 to ELIAS. 
 
41 


 Unless earlier terminated, the ELIAS License shall remain in effect, on a country-by-country basis, until the expiration of the ELIAS Royalty. ELIAS has the right to terminate the ELIAS License for convenience with advance written notice. Each party has the right to terminate the ELIAS License for the uncured material breach of the other party or in the case of bankruptcy of the other party. In addition, we may terminate the ELIAS License immediately upon prior written notice to ELIAS, if they challenge any of the licensed patents. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary rights. We face significant competition from many sources, including pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and private and public research institutions. Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, may have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do, such as larger research and development, clinical, marketing and manufacturing organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. 
 We are focused on developing next-generation viral immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Any viral immunotherapies that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Competition in cancer therapeutics comes in many forms, where different technologies are employed against different molecular targets or biological systems. We are aware of other companies either marketing or focused on developing competing therapies for the treatment of cancer which generally fall into the following treatment groups: 
 

 | Oncolytic viral immunotherapies, including Amgens IMLYGIC (talimogene laherparepvec), the only FDA-approved oncolytic immunotherapy, which is approved for the local treatment of unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal lesions in patients with melanoma recurrent after initial surgery and is in development for several other indications, and other oncolytic viruses in development by companies such as AstraZeneca plc (AstraZeneca), Boehringer Ingelheim, CG Oncology, Inc., Candel Therapeutics, Inc., Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, DNAtrix, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck), Oncolytics Biotech, Inc., Oncorus, Otsuka Holdings Co. Ltd., PsiOxus Therapeutics, Ltd., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron), Replimune Group, Inc., SillaJen, Inc. (SillaJen), Targovax USA, Transgene SA (Transgene), Turnstone Biologics Corp. (Turnstone Biologics) and Vyriad, Inc.;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Approved immunotherapy antibodies and immunotherapy agents in clinical development, including antibody agents, bispecific T cell engagers, including those in development by Amgen, and immuno- oncology companies focused on IL-12, such as Ziopharm Oncology, Inc. (Ziopharm Oncology);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Cancer vaccines, including personalized vaccines and those targeting tumor neoantigens, including neoantigen therapies in development by companies such as Advaxis Inc., Agenus, Inc., AstraZeneca, Bavarian Nordic A/S, BioNTech SE, Genocea Biosciences, Inc., Gritstone Oncology, Inc., Heat Biologics, Inc., ImmunityBio, Inc., Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc. (Iovance), IMV, Inc., Moderna, Inc., SOTIO a.s., Transgene, Turnstone Biologics and VBI Vaccines, Inc.;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Cell-based therapies, including TILs in development by Iovance and approved and in-development CAR T cell therapies, including those commercialized by BMS, Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Novartis AG (Novartis), T cell receptor and NK cell therapies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Therapies aimed at activating innate immunity such as those targeting stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING) and toll-like receptors (TLRs) including those in development by BMS, Checkmate Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Chinook Therapeutics, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK), Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Merck, Mologen AG, Nektar Therapeutics, TriSalus Life Sciences, and UroGen Pharma, Inc.; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Traditional cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, surgery, radiation and targeted therapies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
42 


 These technologies and compounds can focus on very specific targets, such as up- and down-regulating genes, hyperactive protective factors, growth factors, and the immune system or broadly attack the cancer in the manner of conventional chemotherapy and radiation. We believe that our product candidates, if and when marketed, would largely complement rather than compete directly with these existing treatment options. 
 We are aware of several other companies developing therapies based on VACV. To our knowledge, the only clinical product based on VACV that has advanced beyond Phase 1 clinical development is Pexa-Vec, being jointly developed by SillaJen and Transgene. Pexa-Vec has a different product profile from Olvi-Vec, including a different strain of VACV and different transgenes. In August 2019, SillaJen announced the discontinuation of its Phase 3 PHOCUS trial of Pexa-Vec in advanced liver cancer for futility. 
 We are also aware of other companies either marketing or focused on developing competing therapies for the treatment of other cancers which generally fall into the following treatment groups: 
 NSCLC 
 

 | Chemotherapies which include carboplatin (manufactured by sixteen companies), vinorelbine tartrate (manufactured by six companies), paclitaxel (manufactured by seven companies), taxotere (manufactured by fifteen companies), doxorubicin hydrochloride (manufactured by thirteen companies) along with Celgenes Abraxane, Eli Lillys Gemzar and Eli Lillys Alimta.

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manufacturing and Distribution 
 We have assembled a seasoned management team with extensive experience in developing and manufacturing biological, viral and gene therapies. We have strong in-house process development and manufacturing capabilities for VACV. Concurrent with the clinical development of Olvi-Vec, we have been developing a large-scale manufacturing process designed to optimize production of cGMP material that we expect will result in a high yield and lower overall cost of goods. We transitioned from using an external contract manufacturing organization for production of Olvi-Vec in chicken embryo fibroblasts, to establishing our in-house manufacturing facility for larger-scale manufacturing using a mammalian-cell production system. Product is harvested, purified and filled into vials and maintained at -70°C plus or minus 10°C. 
 We signed a long-term lease for a 7,569 square-foot building in San Diego, California and have established and equipped our own manufacturing facility in order to secure supplies for clinical trials and commercial launch. The facility includes laboratories, cleanrooms and vialing rooms, and installed equipment, to accept and prepare raw materials, and produce drug substance and drug product in accordance with cGMPs and all other applicable laws and regulations. This building has additional space for expansion. 
 We maintain agreements with our raw material and equipment suppliers, as well as with contract laboratories to provide services such as analytical development and validation, raw material testing, release testing of drug substance and drug product and stability testing. We also contract with a third party for the labeling, packaging and distribution of our clinical material and we expect to do so in the future for commercial Olvi-Vec product, assuming it receives regulatory approval. We do not have long-term supply arrangements in place with our raw material and equipment suppliers. 
 We continue to invest in our internal development capabilities to establish critical in-house manufacturing expertise to support our pipeline. We expect to continue to invest to improve our proprietary processes that will enable us to be at a competitive advantage when manufacturing product candidates for our VACV immunotherapy program. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 None of our product candidates has been approved for sale. If and when our product candidates receive marketing approval, we intend to commercialize them on our own, or jointly with a partner, in the United States and potentially with pharmaceutical or biotechnology partners in other geographies. We currently have no sales, marketing or commercialization capabilities and have no experience as a company performing such activities. However, we intend to build the necessary capabilities and infrastructure over time following the advancement of our product candidates through clinical development. Clinical data, the size of the opportunity and the size of the commercial infrastructure required will influence our commercialization plans and decision making. 
 
44 


 Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends upon our protecting and enhancing the proprietary technologies, inventions and improvements that we believe are important to our business, and we strive to and intend to seek, maintain and defend intellectual property rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and confidentiality agreements with other third parties, and we rigorously control access to proprietary technology. 
 We believe our rights under issued patents and patent applications, if granted, will provide a competitive advantage. As of December 31, 2022, our patent portfolio consisted of 19 issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application, 20 issued foreign patents, two pending foreign patent applications and one PCT application, which relate generally to the composition of our current and potential future products, and their methods of use. 
 As briefly summarized, below, the 4802 Series claims cover Olvi-Vec and our other technologies from different perspectives. Patent protection for Olvi-Vec in the United States from regulatory extension of issued claims may extend until 2031. 
 

 | 4802 Series  This series of patents includes claims directed to a recombinant vaccinia virus that contains modifications at three gene loci: the thymidine kinase (TK/J2R) gene, hemagglutinin (HA/ A56R) gene and F3 (also named F14.5L) gene loci. Granted claims in the 4802 series include claims directed to isolated cells containing the modified vaccinia virus, pharmaceutical products (including a vaccine) containing the modified vaccinia virus, combinations of the modified vaccinia virus with an anti-cancer agent and methods for eliminating cancerous cells by administering the modified vaccinia virus. There are issued patents in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe (the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy), Japan and Mexico. The United States patents expire in 2026 and 2024; one U.S. patent expires on November 29, 2026 (U.S. Patent No. 7588767) and the other U.S. patents and patents outside the United States expire June 18, 2024, absent any regulatory extensions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | 4816 Series  There are five issued U.S. patents directed to vaccinia viruses that encode a diagnostic or therapeutic protein, combinations of the virus and a chemotherapeutic compound, isolated cells that contain the virus, and methods of treatment by administering the virus. These patents expire in 2027 and 2028, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | 4832 Series  There are pending applications and granted patents directed to clonal isolates of LIVP that demonstrate relatively low toxicity and/or high anti-tumor activity, and thus include possible next generation clinical candidates. These patents expire in April 2032, absent any patent term adjustment (in the United States) and/or regulatory extensions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | 4847 Series  There is an issued U.S. patent directed to methods of increasing infectivity of an oncolytic virus. This patent expires in September 2035, absent any patent term adjustment (in the United States) and/or regulatory extensions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | 4849 Series  There is an issued U.S. patent and a pending PCT application directed to methods for producing viruses that include culturing host cells in a bioreactor. The PCT application, filed upon allowance of the U.S. application, which did not publish, does not claim priority to the U.S. patent. The U.S. patent expires in 2038, and any patent that issues from the PCT application is expected to expire in 2040, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The 4832, 4847 and 4849 Series include claims covering V-VET1 and associated other technologies from different perspectives. Patent protection for V-VET1 in the United States expires in April 2032, absent any patent term adjustment (in the United States) and/or regulatory extensions. 
 
45 


 In addition to the foregoing, we own several other series of patent applications that we believe will add substantial value to our intellectual property, if issued. 
 In 2016, TVAX filed a PCT application covering V2ACT Immunotherapy. The application was nationalized and applications are pending in the United States, Europe and Japan. Patents in this family are expected to expire in 2037, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
 Any future provisional patent applications will not be eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file a non-provisional patent application within 12 months of filing of one or more of our related provisional patent applications. If we do not timely file any non-provisional patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our provisional patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in our provisional patent applications. 
 Although we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications, we cannot predict whether any of our future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that effectively protect our technology or our product candidates, or if any of our future issued patents will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive products. We may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all until they are issued as a patent. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. 
 Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. We also protect our proprietary information by physical security of our premises and our information technology systems. 
 Our commercial success also will depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our product candidates or processes, obtain licenses, or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future product candidates may have an adverse impact on us. 
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of product candidates, some of a sponsors U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. 
 
46 


 However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the products approval date. The patent term restoration period generally is one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biologic product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. Moreover, a given patent may only be extended once based on a single product. An application for patent extension must be filed within 60 days of FDA approval of the product. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. 
 Patent term extension also may be available in other jurisdictions, including the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom, Japan and China. 
 The BPCIA creates an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed biological reference product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires a high similarity to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical trial, absent a waiver by the FDA. There must be no difference between the reference product and a biosimilar in mechanism of action, conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a prior approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biosimilar and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
 A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. However, certain changes and supplements to an approved BLA, and subsequent applications filed by the same sponsor, manufacturer, licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity do not qualify for the twelve-year exclusivity period. The Public Health Service Act (PHSA) also includes provisions to protect reference products that have patent protection. The biosimilar product sponsor and reference product sponsor may exchange certain patent and product information for the purpose of determining whether there should be a legal patent challenge. Based on the outcome of negotiations surrounding the exchanged information, the reference product sponsor may bring a patent infringement suit and injunction proceedings against the biosimilar product sponsor. The biosimilar applicant may also be able to bring an action for declaratory judgment concerning the patent. 
 Biosimilar protection may be available in other jurisdictions, including the EU, United Kingdom and Japan. 
 Also, certain indications, such as pancreatic cancer, for which we plan to develop our products may qualify as an Orphan, or Rare, Disease. A product qualifying for Orphan Drug status is eligible for 7 years of exclusivity following FDA marketing approval. A Rare Disease is defined as affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States; a sponsor may request Orphan Drug status for a drug for only a subset of persons with a particular disease or condition that otherwise affects 200,000 or more people if the sponsor demonstrates that, due to one or more properties of the drug, the remaining persons with such disease would not be appropriate candidates for use of the drug. Orphan Drug status may also be available in other jurisdictions, including the EU, the United Kingdom and Japan.

 Our unregistered trademarks include CHOICE. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), the PHSA, and regulations and guidance documents implementing these laws. The FDCA, PHSA and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, purity, potency, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. Consent from the FDA is required before conducting human clinical testing of biological products. FDA licensure also must be obtained before marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
U.S. Biological Products Development Process 
 Any biologic product must be licensed by the FDA before it may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a biologic product candidate may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

 | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests and in vivo studies in accordance with the FDAs Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug (IND) application, which allows human clinical trials to begin unless FDA objects within 30 calendar days;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB), reviewing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDAs Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Preparation and submission to the FDA of a biological products license application (BLA) for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic product candidate is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic product candidates identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Payment of user fees and FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process of product candidates requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources. Satisfaction of the FDAs pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vivo studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. 
 
48 


 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually must complete some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 A clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 calendar days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA also may impose partial or full clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that partially or fully suspend or terminate such studies. 
 Human Clinical Trials Under an IND 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators which generally are physicians not employed by, or under, the control of the trial sponsor. Clinical trials must be conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, subject selection and exclusion, the trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, and a statistical analysis plan. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 Further, clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with federal regulations and GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial, as well as review and approval by an IRB at each study site participating in the clinical trial or a central IRB. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers items such as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject, or their legal representative, reviews and approves the study protocol, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. 
 Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
 

 | Phase 1. The biologic product candidate initially is introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early understanding of its effectiveness. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2. The biologic product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
49 


 
 | Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as pivotal or registrational studies, which typically denotes a study which presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a biologic product. In Phase 3 studies, the biologic product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the potency and safety of the product for approval. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. 
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. 
 Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for: serious and unexpected adverse events; any findings from other studies, in vivo laboratory tests or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsors initial receipt of the information. Relevant additional information obtained by the sponsor that pertains to a previously submitted IND safety report must be submitted as a follow-up IND safety report. Such report should be submitted within 15 calendar days after the sponsor receives the information. 
 Information about certain clinical trials, including a description of the study and, in some cases, study results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for public dissemination on their clinicaltrials.gov website. Manufacturers or distributors of investigational products for the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of one or more serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions where no other comparable or satisfactory therapeutic options exist must also have a publicly available policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access, sometimes called compassionate use, requests. 
 Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor that regularly reviews accumulated data and advises the study sponsor regarding the continuing safety of the trial. This group may also review interim data to assess the continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. This group receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may advise the sponsor to halt the clinical trial if it determined there is an unacceptable safety risk for 
 subjects or on other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. 
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRBs requirements or if the trial poses an unexpected serious harm to subjects. The FDA or an IRB may also impose conditions on the conduct of a clinical trial. Clinical trial sponsors may also choose to discontinue clinical trials as a result of risks to subjects, a lack of favorable results, or changing business priorities. 
 Compliance with cGMP Requirements 
 Manufacturers of biological products must comply with applicable cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products also must register their establishments with the FDA and 
 
50 


  certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Establishments may be subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Discovery of problems may result in a government entity placing restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, and may extend to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA will not approve a BLA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specification. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 In relation to the clinical trials that may be conducted in other countries with a view to obtaining a marketing authorization, there are equivalent cGMP requirements and other regulatory rules that are implemented nationally. 
 U.S. FDA Review and Approval Process 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical and preclinical testing, the results of the preclinical tests and clinical trials together with detailed information relating to the products CMC, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended (PDUFA), each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. The PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for approved biological products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), a BLA or supplement to a BLA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen, or route of administration, must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Also, applications for product candidates intended for the treatment of adult cancer which are directed at molecular targets that the FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of pediatric cancer, in place of the PREA investigations, sponsors must submit, with the application, reports from molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigations designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data, using appropriate formulations, to inform potential pediatric labeling. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Orphan products are also exempt from the PREA requirements. 
 
51 


 The FDA reviews a BLA within 60 days of submission to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In that event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth, substantive review of the BLA. 
 The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product candidates identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the product candidate. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product candidate within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. 
 On the basis of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. 
 If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. The FDA may also require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biologic products safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 Every five years, the FDA agrees to specified performance goals in the review of BLAs under the PDUFA. One such current goal is to review standard BLAs in ten months after the FDA accepts the BLA for filing, and priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
 
52 


 Post-Approval Requirements 
 After approval, there also are continuing annual program user fee requirements for approved products, excluding, under certain circumstances, orphan products. 
 Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Manufacturers are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states. 
 Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA, together with a release protocol, showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biological products. 
 In addition, manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved therapeutics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, list their products, and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with current cGMP and other requirements, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and third-party manufacturers. Manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with current cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval or notification before being implemented, and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 Moreover, the Drug Quality and Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of biopharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. 
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports, including annual reports and deviation reports, are required following FDA approval of a BLA. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in significant regulatory actions. Such actions may include refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, imposition of a partial or full clinical hold or termination of clinical trials, warning letters, untitled letters, cyber letters, modification of promotional materials or labeling, provision of corrective information, imposition of post-market requirements including the need for additional testing, imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS, product recalls, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow imports or exports, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, FDA debarment, injunctions, fines, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, suspension and 
 
53 


  debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment, and result in adverse publicity, among other adverse consequences. 
 A sponsor also must comply with the FDAs advertising and promotion requirements, such as the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in-patient populations that are not described in the products approved labeling (known as off-label use). The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Violations relating to the promotion of off-label uses may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and other laws, as well as state consumer protection laws. Companies, however, may generally share truthful and non-misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a products FDA approved labeling. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. 
 Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal actions and adverse publicity. These actions could include refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, suspension or termination of a clinical trial by an IRB, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines or other monetary penalties, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare providers, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits or other civil or criminal penalties. 
 Broadly equivalent requirements and controls typically apply in other countries to the submission of marketing authorization applications and, post-approval, to the holding of such marketing authorizations. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations 
 Our business activities, including but not limited to, research, sales, promotion, distribution, medical education, and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous federal and state regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its various divisions, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, and state and local governments. Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and use of pharmaceutical products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payors, existing or potential customers and referral sources, including healthcare providers, are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and these laws and regulations may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which manufacturers conduct clinical research, market, sell and distribute the products for which they obtain marketing approval. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following: 

 | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, in exchange for, or to induce, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and other individuals and entities on the other. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the ACA) amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
54 


 
 | The federal civil and criminal false claims, including the civil FCA, and Civil Monetary Penalties Laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.

 To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
 Violation of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations may result in significant penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, imprisonment, and additional reporting requirements and oversight if a person becomes subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. Furthermore, efforts to ensure that business activities and business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can be costly for manufacturers of branded prescription products.

 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States, sales of any product candidates for which regulatory approval for commercial sale is obtained will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities and health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. 
 A payors decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. 
 
56 


 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost- effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. New metrics frequently are used as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price and actual acquisition cost. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, it may be necessary to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. 
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part. 
 In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. EU member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements. 
 Health Reform 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the biopharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing. 
 By way of example, in March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the healthcare industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our business are: 
 

 | An annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | An increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
57 


 
 | A methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Extension of a manufacturers Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturers Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturers outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, on June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. In addition, in August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA) into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the donut hole under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost through a newly established manufacturer discount program. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA. For example, through the process created by the Budget Control Act of 2011, there are automatic reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, following passage of the BBA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will remain in effect until 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. 
 The heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics, also has resulted in executive orders, congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, President Trump used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders, and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the administrations proposals. The FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September 2020 implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing pathways for states to build and

  submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, the HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. The implementation of the rule has been delayed until 2032. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drugs average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, Promoting Competition in the American Economy, with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Bidens executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA directs the Secretary of HHS to establish a Drug Price Negotiation Program (the Program) to lower prices for certain single-source prescription drugs and biologics covered under Medicare Parts B and D, based on criteria established under the IRA. Under the Program, the Secretary of HHS will publish a list of selected drugs, and will then negotiate maximum fair prices (MFP) with their manufacturers. Beginning in 2026, the first year of the Program, the number will be limited to 10 Part D drugs and biologics. By 2029, and in subsequent years thereafter, the number will increase to 20 drugs and biologics covered under Part D and Part B. Agreements between HHS and manufacturers will remain in place until a drug or biologic is no longer considered a selected drug for negotiation purposes. Manufacturers who do not comply with the negotiated prices set under the Program will be subject to an excise tax based on a percentage of total sales of a selected drug up to 95% and the potential of civil monetary penalties. Further, the IRA imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. In addition, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. 
 At the state level, individual states in the United States have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies. 
 We expect that these initiatives, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, as well as the trend toward managed healthcare and increasing influence of managed care organizations, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government- funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of current and future cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may adversely affect our operations and prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates. 
 Data Privacy and Security 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, receive, process, generate, use, transfer, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit and store (collectively, process) confidential and sensitive information, including personal information, intellectual property, trade secrets, and proprietary information owned or controlled by ourselves or other third parties. Accordingly, we may be subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contractual requirements and other obligations related to data privacy and security. These frameworks are evolving and may impose potentially conflicting obligations. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CPRA) (collectively, CCPA), the 
 
59 


  European Unions General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (EU GDPR), the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (UK GDPR), the ePrivacy Directive, and wiretapping laws. Further, HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, imposes specific requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. In addition, several states within the United States, such as Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah, have enacted comprehensive data privacy laws, and similar laws are being considered at the federal, state, and local levels. 
 The EU GDPR, UK GDPR, and CCPA are examples of the increasingly stringent and evolving regulatory frameworks related to personal information processing that may increase our compliance obligations and exposure for any noncompliance. European data privacy and security laws (including the EU GDPR and UK GDPR) impose significant and complex compliance obligations on companies that are subject to those laws, notably with respect to the processing of health-related data from European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom-based individuals. Additionally, the CCPA applies to personal information of consumers, business representative, and employees who are California residents, imposes specific requirements on covered businesses, provides for administrative fines of up to $7,500 per violation and allows private litigants affected by certain data breaches to recover significant statutory damages. In addition, the CPRA expanded the CCPAs requirements. Furthermore, U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws may require us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal information and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal information. 
 See the section titled Risk FactorsWe are subject to stringent and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, rules, contractual obligations, policies and other obligations related to data privacy and security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; disruptions of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; loss of customers or sales; and other adverse business consequences for additional information about the laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject and about the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations. 
 Additional Regulation 
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biologic, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other countries that impose similar obligations. 
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business abroad or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign government official, government staff member, official or employee of a public international organization, or a political party or political candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with healthcare professionals of foreign state-owned or affiliated hospitals, universities, or research institutions. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts.

 Equivalent laws have been adopted in other foreign countries that impose similar or arguably broader obligations.
