Overview
 We are a clinical stage biotechnology company developing AK002, our wholly owned monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of various eosinophil and mast cell related diseases. AK002 selectively targets both eosinophils and mast cells, white blood cells that are widely distributed in the body and play a central role in the inflammatory response. Inappropriately activated eosinophils and mast cells have been identified as key drivers in a number of severe diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract, eyes, skin, lungs and other organs. As such, AK002 has the potential to treat a large number of severe diseases. AK002 has demonstrated activity in clinical trials. In these trails, AK002 depleted blood eosinophils and improved symptoms in patients with three forms of chronic urticaria (“CU”) and indolent systemic mastocytosis (“ISM”), all mast cell driven diseases. The activity observed in ISM and CU suggest that AK002 could provide significant benefit to patients suffering from these diseases and highlight AK002’s potential to broadly inhibit mast cells in different disease settings. We are developing AK002 for the treatment of eosinophilic gastritis (“EG”), eosinophilic gastroenteritis (“EGE”), and eosinophilic esophagitis (“EoE”). In addition, we have or are currently conducting studies in ISM, CU, and severe allergic conjunctivitis (“SAC”) and are evaluating additional indications for future development.

Figure 1: We are focusing our development efforts on AK002 for the treatment of the diseases shown in bold and are evaluating additional indications for future development.
 Despite the knowledge that eosinophils and mast cells drive many pathological conditions, there are no approved therapies that selectively target both eosinophils and mast cells. AK002 binds to Siglec-8, an inhibitory receptor found on eosinophils and mast cells, which represents a novel way to selectively deplete or inhibit these important immune cells and thereby resolve inflammation. We believe AK002 is the only Siglec-8 targeting

antibody currently in clinical development and has the potential to have advantages over current treatments for the diseases we are pursuing.
 AK002 has demonstrated activity in 3 forms of CU and ISM, and additional studies are currently being conducted in EG/EGE and SAC. CU is a group of inflammatory skin diseases characterized by hives and severe itching resulting from the inappropriate activation of mast cells in the skin. In a phase 2 open-label six month multiple dose study of 47 antihistamine refractory patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria, cholinergic urticaria or dermatographic urticaria, patients reported high levels of disease control and many patients experienced complete resolution of symptoms while receiving AK002. Importantly, AK002 also produced high levels of response in patients that were refractory to the only approved biologic treatment option, Xolair, suggesting that AK002, if approved, could be the treatment of choice for antihistamine refractory CU patients. ISM is a disorder caused by the release of mast cell derived inflammatory mediators throughout the body resulting in severe symptoms in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, joints, and muscles. There are no approved treatments for ISM. In a Phase 1 open-label six month multiple dose study in 11 patients with ISM, patients reported significant improvements in symptoms and improved quality of life measures. The activity observed in ISM and CU suggest that AK002 could provide significant benefit to patients suffering from these diseases and highlight AK002’s potential to broadly inhibit mast cells in different disease settings. 
 Previously, we have shown that AK002 depletes eosinophils. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 trial in 51 healthy volunteers, all doses of AK002 resulted in complete depletion of blood eosinophils within one hour after administration. The duration of depletion was dose-dependent, with a single dose of 1.0 mg/kg of AK002 suppressing eosinophils for up to 84 days. Depletion of blood eosinophils was also observed in the AK002 ISM and CU clinical studies. 
 We are currently testing AK002 in a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial in patients with EG and/or EGE. EG and EGE are severe eosinophilic inflammatory diseases of the stomach and small intestine, respectively. AK002 has received orphan drug designation for EG and EGE from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and we expect to report top-line data from the Phase 2 trial in mid-2019. In addition, AK002 is being tested in a Phase 1 trial in patients with SAC. SAC is a group of allergic eye diseases that are caused by eosinophil and mast cell driven inflammation in the tissues lining the eyes and eyelids. We expect to report top-line data from the trial in SAC patients in the first or second quarter of 2019. The status of our clinical trials is shown below.
 Figure 2. AK002 Development Status

We have prioritized our AK002 development efforts based on our assessment of the probability of clinical and regulatory success, unmet medical need and potential market opportunity. We have assembled a team with a proven track record and deep experience in antibody discovery and in clinical development, commercialization, operations and finance from companies such as Genentech, Gilead, Intermune, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, ZS Pharma and others.

Understanding the Foundation of Our Approach
 Background on Eosinophils, Mast Cells and Siglec-8
 Eosinophils and mast cells are involved in many inflammatory conditions and therefore represent attractive drug targets. Eosinophils and mast cells can respond to signals from allergens, tissues, bacteria, viruses and also cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. In response, they release a large variety of mediators which can result in tissue damage, fibrosis and the recruitment and activation of other innate and adaptive immune cells. The ability to respond to signals from multiple cell types and the diverse array of mediators that they produce place eosinophils and mast cells in the center of multiple aspects of the inflammatory response.
 Eosinophils are normally present in the blood and tissues, especially in the mucosal linings of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. However, they can be recruited to any site of the body in the setting of inflammation. Mast cells reside within the connective tissue of a variety of tissues and all vascularized organs, often located in close proximity to blood vessels, nerves and lymphatics. Sites include the dermis, gut mucosa and submucosa, conjunctiva and pulmonary alveoli and airways. As a result of their widespread location and potent inflammatory activity, eosinophils and mast cells have been identified as key drivers in a number of severe diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, eyes, skin and lungs as well as diseases which affect multiple organ systems.
 Siglec-8 is an inhibitory receptor located selectively on eosinophils, mast cells and, to a lesser extent, on basophils. Because Siglec-8 is expressed in high abundance only on eosinophils and mast cells, it presents a novel way to selectively target these important immune cells. As an inhibitory receptor, the natural function of Siglec-8 is to counteract activating signals within eosinophils and mast cells that lead to an inflammatory response. By binding to Siglec-8, AK002 is able to selectively target eosinophils and mast cells to resolve inflammation.
 Eosinophils and Mast Cells are Effector Cells That are Central to Initiating and Maintaining Inflammatory Responses
 Eosinophils and mast cells respond to a variety of activating signals including those from cell-cell contact, allergens bound to IgE, cytokines (including IL-33, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (“TSLP”), IL-5, IL-4 and IL-13) and viruses (through Toll-Like Receptor-3). In response to these and other activating signals, eosinophils and mast cells produce a broad range of inflammatory mediators that cause tissue damage and contribute to acute and chronic inflammation. These mediators include vasoactive amines, bioactive lipids, proteases, chemokines and cytokines. The mediators, their functions and their contribution to disease pathogenesis are described in more detail below.

• | Mast cells play an important role in inflammation as the main producer of histamine. Histamine causes vasodilation and produces intense itching. It is believed to contribute to increased gastrointestinal peristalsis (diarrhea), the skin symptoms of urticaria and ISM, the diffuse vasodilation of anaphylaxis and bronchospasm in asthma.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proteases and toxins secreted from eosinophils and mast cells are the key cause of tissue damage and contribute to tissue fibrosis. Eosinophil and mast cell secretions are toxic to surrounding cells and break down tissues, resulting in fibrosis and tissue remodeling.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Eosinophils and mast cells drive inflammation by signaling to other cells of the immune system. Eosinophils and mast cells release lipid mediators and a large variety of cytokines (including TNFa, IL-1, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, IL-13, MCP-1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CCL17, TGFa, TGFb and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (“GM-CSF”)) that attract and activate cells of the innate and adaptive immune system, such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, basophils, B-cells, T-cells and dendritic cells, as well as other eosinophils and mast cells.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Figure 3. Eosinophil and Mast Cell Functions
 
 Due to their ability to respond to signals from multiple cell types and elicit responses from others, eosinophils and mast cells mediate the immediate hypersensitivity and late phase responses responsible for allergies and many innate and adaptive immune responses.
 Siglec-8 is an Attractive Target for Eosinophils and Mast Cells
 Siglec-8 (sialic acid immunoglobulin-like lectin 8) is a constitutively expressed inhibitory receptor that is restricted to eosinophils, mast cells and to a lesser extent basophils (approximately 1/100 the level on mast cells and eosinophils). The physiological function of Siglec-8 is to provide an inhibitory signal to eosinophils and mast cells. Siglec-8 exerts these effects through an intracellular immunoreceptor, tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (“ITIM”) and ITIM-like motif. In contrast to approaches which block a single activating cytokine or receptor, targeting the ITIM signaling cascade (via Siglec-8) has the potential to counteract a broad array of activating signals, which could allow for the treatment of multiple diseases. Antibodies to Siglec-8 have been shown to trigger apoptosis of blood and tissue eosinophils and to inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells. In the human clinical studies, AK002 has depeleted eosinophils and demonstrated mast cell inhibitory activity in 4 disease settings: chronic spontaneous urticaria, cholinergic urticaria, symptomatic dermographism, and ISM. This expression pattern and broad inhibitory function make Siglec-8 an attractive target for the selective depletion of eosinophils and inhibition of mast cells.

Our Strategy
 AK002 has shown pharmacodynamic activity in humans and activity in a broad array of animal disease models of eosinophilic and mast cell driven diseases. We have prioritized our development efforts based on our assessment of the probability of clinical and regulatory success, unmet medical need and potential market opportunity. We have chosen to focus our wholly-owned AK002 program initially on four indications: EG, ISM, CU and SAC. The key elements of our strategy are to:

• | Rapidly advance AK002 through clinical development in EG and EGE. AK002 has secured orphan drug designation for the treatment of EG and EGE with the FDA. We have completed a Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers. In this trial, AK002 exhibited clear signs of pharmacodynamic activity by depleting blood eosinophils as soon as one hour after dosing. We are conducting a Phase 2 trial in patients with EG and/or EGE. We believe this trial, if positive, in conjunction with a future Phase 3 trial will serve as the basis for demonstrating safety and efficacy in our biologics license application (“BLA”) and market authorization application (“MAA”) submissions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop AK002 for other EGIDs. EG and EGE are part of a group of related diseases called eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases (“EGIDs”). These include EoE and eosinophilic colitis (“EC”). EGIDs share the common pathology of tissue inflammation caused by the presence of elevated numbers of eosinophils. If AK002 shows activity in EG and EGE, we expect to conduct clinical trials of AK002 in EoE.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Evaluate additional eosinophilic and mast cell driven conditions. We have completed trials for ISM and CU and are conducting an SAC study that is expected to be completed in the first or second quarter of 2019. We will evaluate further development in these and other indications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build commercial capability and retain rights in key markets. If AK002 receives regulatory approval, we intend to retain the rights to it in key markets, and plan to commercialize AK002 in both the United States and Europe through a specialty sales force.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 EG and other EGIDs, ISM, CU and SAC are severe diseases which lack effective treatments. We believe a significant market opportunity for AK002 exists in each of these diseases.
  
• | Coordinate clinical and manufacturing process development. AK002 has been produced under current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) at commercial scale utilizing the commercial process at Lonza Sales AG (“Lonza”), a Contract Development Manufacturing Organization (“CDMO”). We have signed an agreement with Lonza for BLA activities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AK002 Clinical Development Plan
 AK002 was designed to take advantage of the selective expression pattern and inhibitory function of Siglec-8, an inhibitory receptor found on eosinophils, mast cells, and to a lesser extent, on basophils. AK002 is a humanized antibody that binds to Siglec-8 with high affinity (bivalent binding avidity (K D ) = 17 pM, determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis). The high expression level of Siglec-8 on eosinophils and mast cells allows AK002 to selectively deplete eosinophils and inhibit mast cells. AK002 is a non-fucosylated IgG1 antibody engineered to have potent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (“ADCC”). ADCC is a mechanism whereby the binding of an antibody like AK002 triggers an effector cell of the immune system (usually a natural killer (“NK”) cell) to destroy the antibody-bound cell. This provides AK002 with an additional mechanism to deplete eosinophils present in blood, where NK cells also reside. As a result of these dual modes of action, AK002 has been shown to deplete eosinophils in blood and tissue, and to inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells.

AK002 has demonstrated activity in a broad array of animal disease models of eosinophilic and mast cell-driven diseases. Consistent with these experiments, human trials have shown that AK002 depletes blood eosinophils and inhibits mast cell symptoms in 4 different diseases (ISM, chronic spontaneous urticaria, cholinergic urticaria, and symptomatic dermographism). AK002 has generally been well tolerated in our clinical studies. The most common adverse event has been the occurrence of mild to moderate infusion-related reactions (“IRRs”) (flushing, feeling of warmth, headache, nausea or dizziness), which occurred mostly during the first infusion and diminished or did not occur on subsequent infusions. 
 Eosinophilic Gastritis and Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Disorders
 Disease Overview
 EGIDs are chronic inflammatory disorders that share a similar eosinophilic driven inflammation that occurs along different segments of the gastrointestinal (“GI”) tract. Based on the site of eosinophilic infiltration the EGIDs are subcategorized into EoE (esophagus), EG (stomach), EGE (duodenum and small intestine) and EC (colon). The EGIDs affect collectively up to 300,000 patients in the United States, though individually they are orphan diseases.
 EG is a rare disease that is characterized by chronic inflammation due to patchy or diffuse infiltration of eosinophils into layers of the stomach. Symptoms commonly include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malnutrition and weight loss. EG can occur with eosinophilia isolated to the stomach, or often in combination with eosinophilia of the small intestine. Diagnosis is established based on clinical presentation (gastrointestinal symptoms) combined with increased tissue eosinophils in biopsy specimens from the stomach and/or duodenum without any other cause for the eosinophilia. The presence of greater than 30 eosinophils per high powered field (“hpf”) in 5 stomach biopsies identifies the presence of EG and the presence of greater than 30 eosinophils per hpf in 3 duodenal biopsies identifies the presence of EGE. The estimated prevalence of EG in the United States is approximately 20,000 to 25,000 patients, and the estimated prevalence of EGE in the United States is approximately 25,000 patients and we believe these diseases may be significantly underdiagnosed based on our conversations with gastroenterologists.
 It is believed that EG and other EGIDs arise in some patients from food allergies or other allergens that cause a hypersensitivity reaction that leads to recruitment of eosinophils to the GI tract. The gastrointestinal symptoms are believed to be due to the release of inflammatory mediators from activated eosinophils. Mast cells are also elevated and believed to play a significant role. Elevated serum immunoglobulin E (“IgE”) levels and food-specific IgE are correlated with EG in some patients and provide evidence for the allergy hypothesis and mast cell involvement. We have recently demonstrated that in biopsies of patients with symptomatic EG, mast cells are present in elevated numbers compared to normal controls and that the mast cells are also in an increased activation state, providing additional evidence for a pathogenic role of mast cells in EGIDs.
Current Therapies and Limitations
 There are no FDA-approved treatments for EG or EGE. Current therapies and disease management strategies include restricted/elemental diets and systemic or topical corticosteroids. Restricted/elemental diets are designed to avoid foods which trigger symptoms. Unfortunately for most patients the restricted/elemental diets are only partially effective and mainly used as a strategy to provide nutrition despite continuing symptoms. Corticosteroids, systemic or topical, can provide symptom relief, but are not appropriate for long-term treatment due to their numerous side effects. By reducing the number of blood and tissue eosinophils and inhibiting mast cells, AK002 may be effective in the treatment of patients with EG or EGE.
 Clinical Results (healthy volunteer study)
 AK002 was tested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating Phase 1 trial conducted in Melbourne, Australia. 51 healthy volunteers were randomized to receive doses of AK002 (0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary endpoints of the trial were safety and tolerability. The secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (“PK/PD”) measurements, including changes in the absolute peripheral blood counts of eosinophils.

As shown in Figure 5, with respect to the secondary endpoints, all doses of AK002 tested resulted in complete depletion of blood eosinophils one hour after administration, clearly demonstrating the pharmacodynamic activity of AK002. The duration of depletion was dose-dependent with a single dose of 1.0 mg/kg of AK002 suppressing eosinophils for up to 84 days. AK002’s pharmacokinetic half-life was determined to be 18 days.

0.3 | 180 | 140 | 180 | 0 | 28 Days 
1.0 | 60 | 40 | 120 | 0 | 56-84 Days 

 In the multi-dose portion of the trial, subjects received monthly doses of 0.3 mg/kg. Monthly administrations of this dose provided sustained eosinophil depletion for the duration of dosing.
 Safety (All Studies)
 AK002 has generally been well tolerated in our clinical trials. The most common adverse event has been the occurrence of mild to moderate IRRs (consisting of flushing, feeling of warmth, headache, nausea or dizziness) which occurred in 22% of first infusions and 3% of subsequent infusions. Temporal interruption of the AK002 infusion and minimal intervention generally resulted in prompt resolution of symptoms and ability to resume the infusion without further complications, although there have been instances when an IRR has resulted in a subject being discontinued from a trial. 
 There have been no clinically significant effects of AK002 identified in vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory parameters (including hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis) or physical examinations. Transient (resolving within 24 hours) decreases in lymphocyte count have been observed after AK002 infusion, as seen with certain other monoclonal antibodies, that were not associated with any adverse event. 
 Anti-Siglec-8 Antibody Reduces Eosinophil and Mast Cell Levels in EG/EGE Model
 In this model, two groups of Siglec-8 transgenic mice were sensitized with ovalbumin to induce eosinophil and mast cell driven gastrointestinal inflammation similar to that observed in EG and other EGIDs. A third group of animals was administered phosphate buffered saline to serve as normal unsensitized sham controls (“sham”). Treatment with a single dose of anti-Siglec-8 antibody led to lower levels of eosinophils in the blood, stomach and small intestine and reduced numbers of mast cells in the stomach and small intestine compared to mice that received an isotype control antibody (“ISO”).

Anti-Siglec-8 treatment also reduced the levels of multiple important chemokines (CCL5/Rantes, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL17) to the levels of sham control animals. Chemokines are known to recruit and activate cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. By normalizing chemokine secretions, AK002 may be able to reduce further recruitment of immune cells and thereby interrupt the inflammatory cascade.

Phase 2 Trial
AK002 has received orphan drug designation in the United States for the treatment of EG and EGE. We have initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial with AK002 in approximately 60 patients with active, moderate to severe, biopsy-confirmed EG (stomach >30 eosinophils/hpf in 5 hpf) and/or EGE (duodenum >30 eosinophils/hpf in 3 hpf). Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive: (a) 0.3 mg/kg for the first month followed by three doses of 1.0 mg/kg AK002 given monthly, (b) 0.3 mg/kg for the first month followed by 1.0 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg given monthly, or (c) monthly placebo. The primary endpoint is the reduction in gastric or duodenal eosinophils post-treatment with AK002. The secondary endpoints include changes in EG and EGE patient symptoms, such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, as reported by patients using our proprietary daily Patient Reported Outcome (“PRO”) questionnaire. The PRO was developed based on published guidance from the FDA on the development of PRO instruments, and is expected to be used to help determine safety and efficacy in future clinical trials.
 A number of EG patients enrolled in the trial also have concomitant EoE. Consequently, it may be possible to evaluate response to treatment with AK002 in EoE as well. Patients completing the randomized portion of the trial will be eligible to enroll in a nine month safety exposure trial. Top-line data from the Phase 2 trial are expected during mid-2019. Based on discussions with the FDA, we believe that this Phase 2 trial, if successful, and a single Phase 3 trial, if successful, may be sufficient for regulatory approval of AK002 in EG and EGE.

Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis
 Disease Overview
 ISM is a rare disease characterized by the clonal proliferation and accumulation of mast cells in the bone marrow, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, and organs such as the skin, liver, spleen and brain. Common symptoms include pruritus, flushing, headache, cognitive impairment, fatigue, diarrhea, gastrointestinal cramps, hypotension and skin lesions, as well as an increased risk for osteoporosis and anaphylaxis, which in some cases can be life threatening. The symptoms of ISM are attributed to mast cell activation and the systemic release of mediators. Approximately 30,000 patients in the United States suffer from ISM. AK002 has received orphan drug designation from the European Medicines Agency for the potential treatment of ISM.
Current Therapies and Limitations
 There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of ISM by the FDA or EMA. ISM is treated with drugs targeting mast cell mediators, including antihistamines, cromolyn sodium and leukotriene blocking agents. Most patients’ symptoms remain poorly controlled by these treatments. Glucocorticoids can provide temporary relief in some cases; however long-term treatment with steroids is not appropriate due to their many side effects.

Clinical Results
 AK002 has been evaluated in an open-label, single and multiple ascending dose Phase 1 trial in patients with ISM. The single dose portion of this trial was completed during the second quarter of 2017, and the six month multi-dose portion completed in the first quarter of 2019. The primary endpoints of this trial were safety and tolerability. Key secondary endpoints were the PK/PD profile, peripheral counts of eosinophils and patient-reported mastocytosis disease symptoms including itching, hives, skin flushing, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, headache, difficulty concentrating and muscle and joint pain. In the single dose portion, 13 patients received single escalating doses of 0.0003 to 1.0 mg/kg, including three patients receiving 0.3 mg/kg and three patients receiving 1.0 mg/kg of AK002. Five out of six patients receiving 0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg reported to the study investigators that they had improvements in symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, pruritus, difficulty concentrating and headaches.
 In the multi-dose portion of the trial, six patients received six doses of 1.0 mg/kg of AK002 given monthly and five patients received 1.0 mg/kg for the first month and then monthly doses of 3.0 to 10 mg/kg of AK002 for five months. Eosinophil depletion was observed for all patients throughout the dosing period with AK002. ISM symptoms and quality of life were assessed using an Allakos created PRO, the Mastocytosis Questionnaire (“MSQ”), and two published questionnaires, the Mastocytosis Activity and Symptom Severity questionnaire (“MAS”) and the Mastocytosis Quality of Life questionnaire (“MC-QoL”). The MSQ is a proprietary daily PRO Mastocytosis Questionnaire that we developed based on published guidance from the FDA on the development of PRO instruments, and is expected to be used to help determine safety and efficacy in future clinical trials. The questionnaire consists of nine symptom assessments, with each symptom being scored on a 0-10 scale and higher values representing greater symptom burden (total score 0-90 points). For each PRO, baseline scores were collected over 14 to 28 days and compared to scores at Weeks 21 to 22, two weeks after the final AK002 dose. PRO data for the patients in the multidose portion of the trial are presented in Figure 5. Consistent with the improvements reported in the single ascending dose study, AK002 produced clinically significant improvement in patient symptoms in multiple symptoms across all three PROs used in the study.

 AK002 has generally been well tolerated in the Phase 1 ISM study. The most common adverse event was the occurrence of mild to moderate infusion-related reactions (flushing, feeling of warmth, headache, nausea or dizziness), which occurred mostly during the first infusion.
 Chronic Urticarias – Cholinergic Urticaria, Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria, Symptomatic Dermatographism
 Disease Overview
 CU is a group of mast cell driven skin conditions which are characterized by recurrent transient pruritic wheal and flare type skin reactions and, in roughly 40% of patients, angioedema. Symptoms include hives, itching, redness, raised welts, burning, warmth, tingling and irritation of the skin. Patients with CU are often severely impaired in their quality of life, with negative effects on sleep, daily activities, school/work life and social interactions. Urticaria symptoms are caused by degranulation of dermal mast cells, with IgE signaling believed to contribute to mast cell activation in many cases. The most common forms of CU are chronic spontaneous urticaria (“CSU”), cholinergic urticaria and symptomatic dermatographism.
 Despite sharing similar inflammatory pathology, urticarias differ in the triggers that cause the inflammatory response. Cholinergic urticaria patients typically develop symptoms a few minutes after exercise or passive warming in a bath or shower. In some cholinergic patients, emotional stress or hot and spicy food or beverages can also elicit symptoms. Symptomatic dermatographism is characterized by hiving and itching following a minor stroking pressure, rubbing or scratching of the skin. In CSU, itchy, wheal-and-flare-type skin reactions spontaneously appear on the skin at any time of the day or night. In most CSU patients, an underlying cause of CSU cannot be identified making a causal and/or curative treatment difficult. We conservatively estimate that approximately 200,000-500,000 patients with severe CSU, cholinergic urticaria and symptomatic dermatographism could be candidates for therapy with AK002 in the U.S.
Current Therapies and Limitations
 The current treatment guidelines for the management of all forms of urticaria recommend the use of non-sedating oral H1-antihistamines as first-line therapy. For patients that do not respond to standard doses of H1-antihistamines, doses are increased to as high as four times the standard dose. Though this can increase the response rates, side effects also increase, including sedation and anticholinergic effects, such as dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention and constipation. Patients that do not respond to or are unable to tolerate high dose antihistamines have few options. For cholinergic urticaria and symptomatic dermatographism patients, it is recommended that they avoid target triggers such as overheated spaces, hot baths/showers, exercise, specific food allergens and excessive

contact. For antihistamine refractory patients with CSU, the only currently approved treatment is omalizumab, a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody. Unfortunately, approximately 60% of CSU patients continue to have symptoms despite treatment with omalizumab (“Xolair”).
 Clinical Results
 We conducted an open-label Phase 2 trial with AK002 in patients with uncontrolled chronic urticaria despite treatment with H1 antihistamines at up to 4x the labeled dose. The study enrolled four cohorts consisting of 13 xolair naïve patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria patients, 11 Xolair refractory patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (average duration of Xolair treatment 10 months at doses as high as 600mg/month), 11 patients with cholinergic urticaria, and 10 patients with symptomatic dermographism. Baseline symptom scores, as measured by Urticaria Control Test (“UCT”) and Urticaria Activity Score (“UAS7”) were collected over a 4-week screening period. Patients with baseline UCT scores of less than 12, indicative of poorly controlled urticaria, were enrolled in the study and treated with up to 6 doses of AK002 given once monthly. Patients received an initial dose of 0.3 mg/kg at baseline, followed by a dose of 1.0 mg/kg on day 28, and then received monthly doses of either 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg for a total of 6 doses. The primary endpoint of the trial was patient-reported symptoms measured by the UCT. Secondary endpoints include safety and tolerability, as well as patient-reported symptoms as measured by UAS7 (CSU patients only), pulse controlled ergometry (cholinergic urticaria patients only), and FRIC testing (symptomatic dermographism patients only).
  Results for each cohort are shown in Figure 10. Patients in all cohorts reported high levels of disease control and many patients experienced complete resolution of symptoms while receiving AK002. Importantly, AK002 also produced high levels of response in patients that were refractory to Xolair, the only approved biologic treatment option, suggesting that AK002 could the treatment of choice for antihistamine refractory CU patients. Additionally, AK002 depleted blood eosinophils in subjects throughout the dosing period.

 AK002 has generally been well tolerated in the Phase 2 CU study. The most common adverse event was the occurrence of mild to moderate IRRs (flushing, feeling of warmth, headache, nausea or dizziness), which occurred in 34% of first in fusions and 4% of subsequent infusions. 
 Severe Allergic Conjunctivitis
 Disease Overview
 Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (“AKC”), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (“VKC”) and perennial allergic conjunctivitis (“PAC”) are a set of allergic ocular conjunctival diseases primarily associated with an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. We are focused on the severe forms of these diseases, which are collectively referred to as severe allergic conjunctivitis (“SAC”). These conditions are often caused by airborne allergens, such as grass and tree pollens, coming into contact with the eyes, which induces IgE mediated mast cell degranulation and allergic inflammation. The inflammatory mediators released by the mast cell result in inflammation and the infiltration of eosinophils, neutrophils and other immune cells. Eosinophils and mast cells are believed to be the main effector cells, with protease secretions directly damaging the conjunctiva, and play a key role in triggering and maintaining the inflammatory response. Symptoms include itching, hyperemia, light sensitivity (photophobia), pain, eye discharge and the sensation of having a foreign body in the eye. These symptoms can affect quality of life and daily activities, such as reading, driving and being in bright outdoor environments. In addition, patients with untreated disease, in particular those with VKC and AKC, can experience remodeling of the ocular surface tissues that can lead to vision loss. In addition to the primary symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, a high correlation of allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis comorbidities occur in this patient population. We believe that approximately 50,000-150,000 patients in the United States suffer from severe AKC, VKC or PAC and could be candidates for treatment with AK002.
Current Therapies and Limitations
 PAC is treated with topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers. More serious forms are treated with topical and systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporine and other immunomodulatory drugs. There are no drugs approved for AKC and VKC, and as a result, patients are typically treated similarly to patients with PAC. Unfortunately, many patients continue to have symptoms despite these topical and/or systemic treatments and many of the drugs are not suitable for long-term treatment due to undesirable side effects.
Phase 1 Trial
 We are conducting an open-label Phase 1 trial with AK002 in patients with SAC. The trial is enrolling patients with three different forms of allergic conjunctivitis: AKC, VKC and PAC. Thirty patients enrolled (13 AKC, 16 PAC and 1 VKC) and will receive six monthly doses of AK002. The primary endpoint of the trial will be safety and tolerability. Key secondary endpoints include patient-reported symptom measures of ocular itch, pain, lacrimation, photophobia and foreign body sensation. In addition, a number of patients enrolled in the trial will also have 
 13


concomitant allergic rhinitis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis. Consequently, it may be possible to evaluate response to treatment with AK002 in these allergic conditions as well. Given that the trial is an open-label study, it is not designed to show statistical significance. We expect to report data from this trial in the first or second quarter of 2019.

Preclinical Results
 AK002 Results in Animal Disease Models Suggest Broad Activity
 Because Siglec-8 is found only in cells of humans and certain other primates, we have developed a proprietary Siglec-8 transgenic mouse, in which Siglec-8 is expressed with a similar tissue distribution to humans and is functionally active. The transgenic mouse provides us with a proprietary tool to assess the safety, tolerability and activity of anti-Siglec-8 antibodies.
 AK002 has completed short- and long-term toxicity studies in Siglec-8 transgenic mice. Chronic weekly dosing for six months with AK002 in transgenic mice at dose levels of 50 or 100 mg/kg resulted in no adverse AK002-related findings in mortality, clinical observations, body weight, food consumption and anatomic pathology after the end of dosing. Non-adverse findings included decreases in eosinophil counts in both sexes at 50 mg/kg/week, which persisted through the recovery period. These findings reflect the expected pharmacology of AK002. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level of AK002 after chronic dosing for six months was 100 mg/kg/week.
 We have shown that AK002 or antibodies to Siglec-8 have broad activity in animal disease models (eosinophilic gastroenteritis, anaphylaxis, fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and in human ex vivo diseased tissue (eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease, mastocytosis, atomic dermatitis and lung). In these models, anti-Siglec-8 antibodies have significantly reduced eosinophil and inhibited mast cells. The activity in these models suggests AK002 has the potential to treat eosinophil and mast cell inflammation in a number of disease settings and highlights AK002’s ability to inhibit the inflammatory cascade triggered by different activating signals.
 Anti-Siglec-8 Antibody Inhibits IgE Mediated Systemic Anaphylaxis in Mouse Model
 The ability of an anti-Siglec-8 antibody to inhibit IgE-mediated mast cell activation was demonstrated in a mouse model of systemic anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis occurs due to IgE-mediated release of inflammatory mediators and cytokines from mast cells, which results in vasodilation, a reduction in core body temperature, itchiness and bronchoconstriction, among other symptoms. In this model, “humanized” mice engrafted with human immune cells were pretreated with an anti-Siglec-8 antibody or an isotype control antibody, administered an allergen-specific IgE, and 24 hours later, anaphylaxis was triggered using an allergen. Mice treated with the isotype control antibody plus IgE and allergen displayed symptoms of anaphylaxis and body temperature decreases that peaked 10 to 40 minutes after inducing anaphylaxis. In contrast, mice treated with the anti-Siglec-8 antibody plus IgE and allergen displayed no observable symptoms and had no significant changes in core body temperature.

Figure 12. Effects of Anti-Siglec-8 in a Mouse Model of Systemic Anaphylaxis

Anti-Siglec-8 Antibody Decreases Bleomycin Induced Lung Fibrosis in Mouse Model
 Lung fibrosis induced by bleomycin is believed to be due to the increased expression of IL-33. IL-33 induces mast cells to release mediators that activate fibroblasts leading to fibrosis and collagen deposition. In this model, lung fibrosis was induced by administering bleomycin to Siglec-8 transgenic mice every other day for 30 days. On days 14, 21 and 28, an anti-Siglec-8 or isotype control antibody was administered. Fibrosis was assessed on day 30 for anti-Siglec-8 or isotype control antibody treated mice and compared to sham treated mice (mice that did not receive bleomycin). Relative to control antibody mice, mice treated with an anti-Siglec-8 antibody displayed minimal fibrotic changes. In addition, the bronchoalveolar lavage (“BAL”) of anti-Siglec-8 treated mice displayed reduced levels of infiltrating leukocytes that were similar to sham treated animals.

  Anti-Siglec-8 Antibody Inhibits IL-33/TSLP Activation of Mast Cells from Human Skin
 IL-33 combined with TSLP is a potent activator of mast cells and results in increased expression of the mast cell activation marker CD63. Mast cells isolated from skin showed a 20% increase in the expression of CD63 after overnight exposure to IL-33 and TSLP. In contrast, skin mast cells treated with AK002 along with IL-33 and TSLP did not show increased activation, with CD63 levels remaining similar to control levels (no IL-33 and TSLP exposure). In addition, the levels of chemokines CCL2 and ENA78 did not increase after stimulation with IL-33 and TSLP in the presence of AK002. Chemokines are known to recruit and activate cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. By normalizing chemokine secretions, AK002 may be able to prevent further recruitment of immune cells and thereby interrupt the inflammatory cascade.

AK001
 We initially began developing two product candidates, AK001 and AK002, both of which are monoclonal antibodies targeting Siglec-8. These compounds entered clinical development in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Due to the greater activity of AK002, we decided to focus our development efforts on AK002 and discontinued the 
 16


development of AK001 in 2017. We have no current plans to continue development of AK001, but may choose to do so in the future.
 Preclinical Programs
 We are developing two additional antibodies targeting novel immune system receptors for the treatment of cancer. These antibodies are being assessed in a variety of animal models.
Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological advancement, significant competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates will include efficacy, safety profile, convenience, cost, level of promotional activity devoted to them and intellectual property protection.
 We are not aware of any other company or organization that is conducting clinical trials of a product candidate that targets both eosinophils and mast cells, including any product candidate that specifically targets Siglec-8. The competition we may face with respect to each of the indications we are targeting with AK002 includes:
  
• | EG, EGE and EoE. Currently, there are no therapies that have been approved by the FDA specifically for EG, EGE or EoE. Several companies, including but not limited to, Regeneron, AstraZeneca, Celgene, Shire, and Dr. Falk Pharma have or are conducting studies in these indications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ISM. We are not aware of any FDA-approved treatment options that target the underlying causes of ISM. Blueprint Medicines initiated a phase 2 trial evaluating avapritinib in smoldering systemic mastocytosis and ISM in the second half of 2018.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | CU. Xolair is a FDA-approved drug approved for the treatment of CSU. We are not aware of any FDA-approved treatment options for cholinergic urticaria or symptomatic dermatographism. Companies conducting studies in chronic spontaneous urticaria include: Novartis Pharmaceuticals (ligelizumab), Genentech (fenebrutinib), and Gossamer Bio (GB100).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SAC. The products that are currently available for treatment of SAC only provide temporary relief for most patients and have little effect on moderate to severe cases. We are not aware of any other company specifically targeting SAC.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 Sales and Marketing
 In light of our stage of development, we currently have limited marketing and sales capabilities. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to all of our product candidates. We intend to retain the rights to our compounds in key markets, and plan to build our own focused, specialty sales force to commercialize approved products in both the United States and Europe.
 17


Manufacturing
 We must manufacture drug product for clinical trial use in compliance with cGMP regulations. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our product candidates must meet cGMP requirements and FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority’s satisfaction before any product is approved and our commercial products can be manufactured. Our third-party manufacturers will also be subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other foreign authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations.
 We do not currently have the infrastructure or internal capability to manufacture our product candidates for use in clinical development and commercialization. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party manufacturers for the production of our product candidates in compliance with cGMP requirements clinical trials under the guidance of members of our organization. In the case of AK002, we rely on a single third-party manufacturer, Lonza, and we currently have no alternative manufacturer in place. We do not have long-term supply agreements and we purchase our required drug product on a purchase order basis. We expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for the commercial supply of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We have personnel with significant technical, manufacturing, analytical, quality, regulatory, including cGMP, and project management experience to oversee our third-party manufacturers and to manage manufacturing and quality data and information for regulatory compliance purposes.
 Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. Contract manufacturers often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel. Any of these actions or events could have a material impact on the availability of our products.
 In-Licensing Agreements 
 We have entered into two in-licensing agreements with third-parties for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of our products including AK002. The specific terms of the individual agreements are discussed in further detail below. In aggregate, we anticipate our total royalty obligation on AK002 from these two agreements will be a mid single digit percentage of net sales by us and our affiliates and sublicensees. 
 Exclusive License Agreement with The Johns Hopkins University
 We have exclusively licensed intellectual property from The Johns Hopkins University (“JHU”) in a license agreement dated December 20, 2013 and amended and restated September 30, 2016. In December 2013, we entered into an agreement with JHU for an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize for the treatment and prevention of disease products covered by the JHU licensed patent rights or derived from materials provided by JHU. In September 2016, we and JHU amended and restated the license agreement to an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize in all fields products covered by the licensed patent rights, or derived from materials provided by JHU.
 Under the license agreement we are obligated to make payments to JHU for therapeutic products aggregating up to $4.0 million based on achieving specified development and regulatory approval milestones. We will also pay single-digit royalties to JHU based on net sales of each licensed therapeutic product by us and our affiliates and sublicensees and have up to a low six digit dollar minimum annual royalty payment. In addition, in the event we sublicense the JHU intellectual property, we are obligated to pay JHU a specified portion of income we receive from sublicensing.
 Our royalty obligation with respect to each licensed product in a country extends until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire patent licensed from JHU covering the licensed product in the country or the 
 18


expiration of a specified number of years after the first commercial sale of any licensed product in any country. The latest possible expiration date of patents licensed under the agreement is 2021 in all applicable countries, in the absence of any patent extensions that may be available for such patents.
 Non-Exclusive License Agreement with BioWa Inc. and Lonza Sales AG
 We have licensed on a non-exclusive basis intellectual property from BioWa Inc. (“BioWa”) and Lonza pursuant to a license agreement dated October 31, 2013. The agreement grants Allakos a non-exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize certain products manufactured in a particular mammalian host cell line for the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of human disease.
 Under the license agreement, we are obligated to pay BioWa an annual commercial license fee of $40,000 until such time as BioWa receives royalty payments. We may also become obligated to make payments to BioWa aggregating up to $41.0 million based on achieving specified milestones, and to pay low single-digit royalties to BioWa based on net sales of licensed product by us and our affiliates and sublicensees. Our royalty obligation to BioWa with respect to each licensed product in a country extends until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent covering the licensed product in the country or the expiration of either regulatory exclusivity or a specified number of years after the first commercial sale of the licensed product in the country, whichever is later.
 We may also pay low single-digit royalties to Lonza based on net sales of each licensed product by us and our affiliates and sublicensees. We will be required to pay an annual license fees to Lonza if we (or our strategic partner) manufactures a particular product using the particular cell line, or if we utilize a third party CMO to manufacture a product using such system. Our royalty obligation to Lonza with respect to each licensed product in a country extends until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent covering the licensed product in the country or a specified number of years after the first commercial sale of the licensed product in the country, whichever is later. The latest possible expiration date of patents licensed under the agreement is 2021 or 2023, depending on the country, in the absence of any patent extensions that may be available for such patents.
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Development
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, 
 19


disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 Any future product candidates must be approved by the FDA through either a BLA or NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice (“GLP”), requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice (“GCP”), requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;
--+----------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to accept the filing for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of a FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The data required to support an NDA or BLA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
 Preclinical Studies and IND
 The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of 
 20


reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 Clinical Trials
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA or BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
 Clinical trials in the United States generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap.
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, tolerability and safety of the drug.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further PK and PD information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious 
 21


and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug or biologic, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that our product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
 NDA/BLA Review Process
 Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. In short, the NDA or BLA is a request for approval to market the drug or biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug or safety, purity and potency for a biologic. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2016, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an NDA or BLA, is $2.3 million. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for human drugs and biologics (approximately $97,750) and an annual establishment fee (approximately $580,000) on facilities used to manufacture prescription drugs and biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular-entity NDA or original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular-entity NDA or original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not 
 22


approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
 Orphan Drugs
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if a product candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biologics are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast 
 23


track status any time before receiving NDA or BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA or pre-BLA meeting.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies.
 A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”), which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product.
 Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
 Abbreviated Licensure Pathway of Biological Products as Biosimilar or Interchangeable
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”), created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The BPCIA attempts to minimize duplicative testing, and thereby lower development costs and increase patient access to affordable treatments. An application for licensure of a biosimilar product must include information demonstrating biosimilarity based upon the following, unless the FDA determines otherwise:

• | analytical studies demonstrating that the proposed biosimilar product is highly similar to the approved product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | animal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | a clinical trial or trials (including the assessment of immunogenicity and PK or PD) sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more conditions for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, an application must include information demonstrating that:
  
• | the proposed biosimilar product and reference product utilize the same mechanism of action for the condition(s) of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling, but only to the extent the mechanism(s) of action are known for the reference product;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the labeling for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously approved for the reference product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the route of administration, the dosage form and the strength of the proposed biosimilar product are the same as those for the reference product; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure that the biological product continues to be safe, pure and potent.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 24


Biosimilarity means that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components; and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. In addition, the law provides for a designation of “interchangeability” between the reference and biosimilar products, whereby the biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. The higher standard of interchangeability must be demonstrated by information sufficient to show that:
  
• | the proposed product is biosimilar to the reference product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | the proposed product is expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | for a product that is administered more than once to an individual, the risk to the patient in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the biosimilar and the reference product is no greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 FDA approval is required before a biosimilar may be marketed in the United States. However, complexities associated with the large and intricate structures of biological products and the process by which such products are manufactured pose significant hurdles to the FDA’s implementation of the law that are still being worked out by the FDA. For example, the FDA has discretion over the kind and amount of scientific evidence—laboratory, preclinical and/or clinical—required to demonstrate biosimilarity to a licensed biological product.
 The FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence, provided by a sponsor to support a demonstration of biosimilarity, and recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach in the development of their biosimilar products. Biosimilar product applications thus may not be required to duplicate the entirety of preclinical and clinical testing used to establish the underlying safety and effectiveness of the reference product. However, the FDA may refuse to approve a biosimilar application if there is insufficient information to show that the active ingredients are the same or to demonstrate that any impurities or differences in active ingredients do not affect the safety, purity or potency of the biosimilar product. In addition, as with BLAs, biosimilar product applications will not be approved unless the product is manufactured in facilities designed to assure and preserve the biological product’s safety, purity and potency.
 The submission of a biosimilar application does not guarantee that the FDA will accept the application for filing and review, as the FDA may refuse to accept applications that it finds are insufficiently complete. The FDA will treat a biosimilar application or supplement as incomplete if, among other reasons, any applicable user fees assessed under the Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 have not been paid. In addition, the FDA may accept an application for filing but deny approval on the basis that the sponsor has not demonstrated biosimilarity, in which case the sponsor may choose to conduct further analytical, preclinical or clinical studies and submit a BLA for licensure as a new biological product.
 The timing of final FDA approval of a biosimilar for commercial distribution depends on a variety of factors, including whether the manufacturer of the branded product is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods, during which time the FDA is prohibited from approving any products that are biosimilar to the branded product. The FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application for twelve years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. Additionally, a biosimilar product sponsor may not submit an application for four years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. A reference product may also be entitled to exclusivity under other statutory provisions. For example, a reference product designated for a rare disease or condition (an “orphan drug”) may be entitled to seven years of exclusivity, in which case no product that is biosimilar to the reference product may be approved until either the end of the twelve-year period provided under the biosimilarity statute or the end of the seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period, whichever occurs later. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent, and thus block biosimilarity applications from being approved on or after the patent expiration date. In addition, the FDA may under certain circumstances extend the exclusivity period for the reference product by an additional six months if the FDA requests, and the manufacturer undertakes, studies on the effect of its product in children, a so-called pediatric extension.
 25


The first biological product determined to be interchangeable with a branded product for any condition of use is also entitled to a period of exclusivity, during which time the FDA may not determine that another product is interchangeable with the reference product for any condition of use. This exclusivity period extends until the earlier of: (1) one year after the first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable product; (2) 18 months after resolution of a patent infringement against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product, based on a final court decision regarding all of the patents in the litigation or dismissal of the litigation with or without prejudice; (3) 42 months after approval of the first interchangeable product, if a patent infringement suit against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product is still ongoing or (4) 18 months after approval of the first interchangeable product if the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product has not been sued.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping requirements, requirements to report adverse experiences and comply with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA/BLA or NDA/BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs and biologics may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 26


Other U.S. Regulatory Matters
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.
 For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
 Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The distribution of biologic and pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
 The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
 U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”). The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or 
 27


restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of a NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 A reference biological product is granted twelve years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
 European Union Drug Development
 As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (“NCA”), and one or more Ethics Committees (“ECs”). Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014 ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU will be identical. In the meantime, Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC continues to govern all clinical trials performed in the EU.
 28


European Union Drug Review and Approval
 In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union (including Norway and excluding Croatia), Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (“MA”). There are two types of marketing authorizations.

• | The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (“RMS”). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (“SPC”), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug or biological products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
 The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
 The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for 
 29


states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (“AMP”), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), have proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well.
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
 For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug prices are determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.
 As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. An increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our

products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 62 full-time employees, 40 of whom were engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement.
Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters are currently located in Redwood City, California, where we lease 25,136 square feet of office, research and development and laboratory space pursuant to a lease agreement that expires on July 31, 2029. The lease agreement includes an option to extend the term for an additional period of five years. The new lease agreement also provides us a right of first offer to expand into available space on the first floor of the building. We will be responsible for payment of our proportionate share of taxes and operating expenses for the building, in addition to monthly base rent in the initial amount of $0.1 million, with 3% annual increases, which monthly base rent is abated for the first nine months of the lease term. We provided a security deposit under the lease in the form of a letter of credit in the initial amount of $0.8 million, subject to a reduction to $0.4 million following the 45th month of the term and the satisfaction of certain conditions. We believe that these existing facilities will be adequate for our near-term needs. If required, we believe that suitable additional or alternative space would be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms.
Legal Proceedings
 From time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings. We are not currently a party to any litigation or legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. Our patent portfolio is intended to cover our product candidates and components thereof, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, our proprietary reagents and assays and any other inventions that are commercially important to our business. We also rely on trade secret protection of our confidential information and know-how relating to our proprietary technology, platforms and product candidates.
 We believe that we have substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to our technology and product candidates. Our patent portfolio as of March 7, 2019 contains seven issued and unexpired U.S. patents and eight pending U.S. patent applications that are solely owned or exclusively licensed by us and numerous foreign counterparts of these patents and patent applications.
 We have exclusively licensed from JHU five issued and unexpired U.S. patents and also foreign counterparts, with claims granted in Europe and Japan. The JHU licensed patent rights include issued U.S. patents with claims that recite anti-Siglec-8 antibodies comprising the CDRs of a particular antibody and methods of use a class of antibodies that bind to Siglec-8 for treating particular diseases. We own two granted U.S. patents that claim the active component of AK002 (an anti-Siglec-8 antibody), pharmaceutical compositions comprising AK002, and methods for the treatment of particular diseases using antibodies to Siglec-8, with a projected expiration date in 2035 in the absence of patent extensions. Similar patent applications are pending in Europe and Japan. We have 
 31


eight further pending families of patent applications that include U.S. and foreign applications relating to methods of treatment for treating particular diseases using antibodies to Siglec-8 and methods of delivering antibodies to Siglec-8. We have also filed patent applications with claims pending relating to antibodies in preclinical development and methods for treating cancer with these antibodies. We also have a non-exclusive license to intellectual property from BioWa and Lonza regarding the expression and manufacturing of monoclonal antibodies in particular mammalian host cell lines.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended.
 Similar provisions are available in the European Union and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our product candidates, including AK002, receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors. Expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension or other market exclusivity that may be available to us.
 We also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
