ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General
 
On March 31, 2011, it was announced that our board had determined it would be in the best interest of our shareholders to transfer all of our online and operational technologies to our subsidiary, Worlds Online Inc. (currently called MariMed Inc.). The assets were transferred as of May 16, 2011 and included: Worlds’ technology platform, Worlds Ultimate Chat, Aerosmith World, DMC Worlds, Cinema Virtual, Pearson contracts and related revenue, URLs: Worlds.com, Cybersexworld.com, Hang.com, and Worldsfunds.com, a digital inventory of over 10,000 3D objects, animation sequences, an extensive avatar library, texture maps and virtual world architectures. The Company also entered into a License Agreement with MariMed Inc. to sublicense its patented technologies, which License expired upon the expiration of the underlying patents.
 
Worlds Inc. has retained all of its related Intellectual Property (IP) consisting of the nine existing patents, 6,219,045; 7,181,690; 7,493,558; 7,945,856; 8,082,501; 8,145,998; 8,161,385, 8,407,592 and 8,640,028 and all continuance claims currently before the USPTO including any to be filed going forward. While the last of these patents expired in 2016, we continue to pursue infringement we believe occurred during the lifetime of the patents.
 
We intend to endeavor to prosecute our issued patents and any future issued patents against all parties that the company and our legal counsel believe to be infringing on said patents.
 
Enforcement actions are subject to the analysis of all relevant prior art and the costs associated with litigation.
 
We may also seek to acquire additional patents we believe will enhance our portfolio position in the markets within which our existing patents cover.
 
There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our ability to prosecute our IP portfolio or that we will be able to acquire additional patents.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we own an approximately 2,994,697 shares in MariMed Inc.
 
Before the spin-off, Worlds was a leading 3D entertainment portal which leveraged its proprietary technology, which we retained through our patent portfolio, to offer visitors a network of virtual, multi-user environments which we call "worlds". These worlds are visually engaging online environments featuring animation, motion and content where people can come together and, by navigating through the website, shop, interact with others, attend events and be entertained. In support of this portal and the overall business strategy, we design and develop software, content and related technology for the creation of interactive, three-dimensional ("3D") Internet web sites. Using our technology, we created our own Internet sites, as well as sites available through third-party online service providers.
 
Sites using our technology allow numerous, simultaneous visitors to enter, navigate and share interactive "worlds". Our 3D Internet sites are designed to promote frequent, repeat and prolonged visitation by users by providing them with unique online communities featuring dynamic graphics, highly useful and entertaining information content, and interactive capabilities. We believe that sites are highly attractive to advertisers because they offer access to demographic-specific user bases comprised of people that visit the site frequently and stay for relatively long periods of time.

Recent developments

In 2018, 7,000,000 post split warrants were exercised at a post split exercise price of $0.125 per share raising $875,000 and the Company raised $4,692,990 from the sale of marketable securities.
 On February 9, 2018 we implemented a 5:1 reverse split.
 
Our Technology
 
We used our technology to produce three-dimensional portals and web sites. We believe that our core technology delivers a considerably faster frame rate for user experiences and, in some cases, a meaningful productivity increase in art production and integration over its previous generation production tools. Our technology permits the development of virtual worlds which have broad applications. These applications include but are not limited to:

• | a virtual meeting place (such as a fan club);
--+----------------------------------------------


• | a 3D e-commerce store (where merchandise can be viewed in 3D and purchased online); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a virtual classroom (where content can be viewed via video streaming and then discussed in real time).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our core technology has substantial elements written in Sun Microsystem's programming language, Java, including WorldsBrowser and WorldsShaper, so we expect that it can be made portable across Windows and UNIX Platforms because of Java's platform independence.
 
Our core technology includes:
 

• | WorldsShaper: WorldsShaper is the visual authoring component of our platform. It allows for quick assembly of pieces to create multi-user, shared state, virtual worlds. The WorldsShaper is an advanced compositing 3D building tool that integrates pre-existing or custom content, such as 3D models, textures or images created in Adobe's Photoshop, or midi or wave sound files, with architectural geometry and interactive behaviors and actions written in Java. The architectural building blocks for creating 3D worlds, the flexibility and power of integrating professional modeling and imaging tools, and the extensibility via Java make the WorldsShaper a tool well-suited for rapid creation of 3D environments.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | WorldsServer: WorldsServer is the scalable software that we use to control and operate our on-line virtual communities. WorldsServer manages the registration and authentication of users, the locations of users within the 3D environment, the physical structure of the 3D environment, all information regarding objects that are "shared" by the participants and any of the interactions between the users such as text chat. This platform also integrates an HTTP server for the delivery of other content such as audio and video streaming and secure e-commerce applications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | WorldsBrowser: WorldsBrowser is used to access the 3D environments. The browser is optimized for speed, delivering relatively fast frame rates per second in highly textured virtual 3D worlds.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | WorldsPlayer™: The WorldsPlayer allows users to view and experience our multi-user, interactive technology. Any world created with the WorldsShaper will be viewable and navigable with the WorldsPlayer. The WorldsPlayer has a high frame rate for fast, quality graphics, an easy-to-use graphic user interface, 2D web browser integration, automatic upgrade capability over the internet and a complete communication tool set including text chat, voice-to-voice chat, e-mail and animation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Worlds Gamma Libraries: The Worlds Gamma Libraries are composed of sample worlds, textures, models, avatars, actions, sensors, sounds, motion sequences, and other behaviors.

Our Strategy
 
Worlds Inc. will be focused solely on expanding our patent portfolio and to enforce our rights where it believes parties are infringing on its IP portfolio.
 
Effective upon the spin-off, we contracted to MariMed Inc. a perpetual world-wide license to our patented technology. However, inasmuch as the patents are currently expired we do not expect any licenses to be issued.
 
Competition
 
Since all operations were transferred to Worlds Online and our business is now the expansion of our patented technology, the Company does not have any direct competition as it did in the past. However, inasmuch as we believe that multi-user, interactive 3D is becoming a “hot” area, we expect other companies, many with far more resources than us, to move into this space.
 
Currently, there are many companies collaborating to establish standardization of 3D usage on the Internet, the adoption of which may require changes to our technology.
 
Intellectual Property
 
U.S. Patents: Worlds has been granted U.S patent 6,219,045, 7,181,690, 7,493,558, 7,945,856, 8,082,501, 8,145,998, 8,161,385, 8,407,592 and 8,640,028 for multi-server technology for 3D applications, which is our core technology.  While the patents have all expired, we continue looking into the implications and breadth of the patent in order to maximize there benefits.  The description of the initial patent is as follows:
 
"The present invention provides a highly scalable architecture for a three dimensional, multi-user, interactive virtual world system.  In a preferred embodiment a plurality of users interact in the three-dimensional, computer-generated graphical space where each user executes a client process to view a virtual world from the perspective of that user.  The virtual world shows Avatars representing the other users who are neighbors of the user viewing the virtual world.  In order that the view can be updated to reflect the motion of the remote user's Avatar, motion information is transmitted to a central server process that provides position updates to client processes for neighbors of the user at that client process.  The client process also uses an environment database to determine which background objects to render as well as to limit the number of displayable Avatars to a maximum number of Avatars displayable by that client."
 
Trademark: Worldsplayer - The WorldsPlayer is especially designed to allow users to view and experience the multi-user, interactive Worlds Gamma technology. Any world created with the WorldsShaper will be viewable and navigable with WorldsPlayer.  Utilizing the WorldsPlayer, a user assumes a persona (via a digital actor, or Avatars), and can then move, view, chat, play, express one's self via gestures and animations, voice chat, send email, join discussion groups, listen to music, shop at Worlds 3D stores, and watch videos, all in the company of users from around the world, within the 3D environment.  The WorldsPlayer boasts high frame rate for fast, high quality graphics, an easy to use graphic user interface, seamless 2D Web browser integration, auto-upgrade capability over the Internet, and a complete communication tool set including chat, voice-to-voice chat, email and animation. The WorldsPlayer offers users the unique and creative experience of customizing their Avatars, while maintaining the ability to animate and activate their Avatars.   
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had one full time employee, our president, Thomas Kidrin.
 
Corporate History
 
We were formed as a result of the contemporaneous mergers on December 3, 1997 of Worlds Inc., a Delaware corporation formed on April 26, 1994 with and into Worlds Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation formed on April 8, 1997 and of Worlds Acquisition Corp. with and into Academic Computer Systems, Inc., a New Jersey corporation formed on May 20, 1968 (the "Mergers"). Academic Computer Systems changed its name to Worlds Inc. after the Mergers. In December 1999, we changed our name from Worlds Inc. to Worlds.com Inc. in order to better reflect our business as a consumer Internet web site that offers virtual "worlds" in which consumers interact, conduct e-commerce and receive entertainment. 
 
The Company created a wholly-owned subsidiary named Worlds Online Inc. on January 25, 2011. On May 16, 2011, Worlds Inc. transferred to Worlds Online Inc. the majority of its operations and related operational assets, except for its patent portfolio. Worlds Online Inc. changed its name to MariMed Inc. in 2017.
