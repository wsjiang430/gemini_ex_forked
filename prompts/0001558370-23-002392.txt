Products and Markets
The following is a brief description of some of our brands and product lines:
The Green Giant and Le Sueur brands trace their roots to Le Sueur, Minnesota in 1903, and the Minnesota Valley Canning Company. For more than 100 years, Green Giant and Le Sueur vegetables have been grown and picked at the peak of perfection in the Valley of the Jolly Green Giant. In the remainder of this report, we generally refer to the Green Giant and Le Sueur brands collectively as the “Green Giant brand.”
The Crisco brand was introduced in 1911 and has revolutionized the way food is prepared and the way it tastes. From being the first shortening product made of plant based oils and oil seeds to creating the first cooking oil that was promoted for its light taste, Crisco has been making life in the kitchen more delicious for years. Today, Crisco is the number one brand of vegetable shortening, the number one brand of vegetable oil and also holds a leadership position in other cooking oils and cooking sprays.

We also offer Cream of Rice, a gluten-free, rice-based hot cereal.

In 2005, the leading brand in salt-free seasonings introduced salt-free marinades. Dash’s brand essence, “Salt-Free, Flavor-Full,” resonates with consumers and underscores the brand’s commitment to provide healthy products that fulfill consumers’ expectations for taste. Prior to 2020, the brand was known as Mrs. Dash.
Victoria Fine Foods is a Brooklyn-based business founded in 1929. The Victoria brand offers a variety of premium pasta and specialty sauces, savory condiments and tasty gourmet spreads.

sweetened fruit spread. The spreads are available in more than a dozen flavors. Polaner Sugar Free preserves are the second leading brand of sugar free preserves nationally.
The Tone’s brand started as a family business in 1873 and was responsible for many of the early advancements in the spice industry. The Tone’s brand sells predominantly in the club channel while also servicing traditional grocery.
The Underwood brand’s “Underwood Devil” logo, which was registered in 1870, is believed to be the oldest registered trademark still in use for a prepackaged food product in the United States.

The Ac’cent brand was introduced in 1947 as a flavor enhancer for meat preparation and is generally used on beef, poultry, fish and vegetables. We believe that Ac’cent is positioned as a unique flavor enhancer that provides food with the “umami” flavor sensation.

The Cary’s brand originated in 1904 and is the oldest brand of pure maple syrup in the United States. Cary’s also offers sugar free syrup.
The Regina brand, which has been in existence since 1949, includes vinegars and cooking wines. Regina products are most commonly used in the preparation of salad dressings as well as in a variety of recipe applications, including sauces, marinades and soups.
The Static Guard brand, the number one brand name in static elimination sprays, created the anti-static spray category when it was launched in 1978 to fulfill a previously unmet consumer need.

Food Industry
The food industry is one of the United States’ largest industries. Historically, it has been characterized by relatively stable sales growth, based largely on price and population increases. In recent years, however, excluding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, many traditional center of store grocery brands in the industry have often experienced flat to modestly declining sales. Over the past decade or so, the retail side of the food industry has seen a continuing shift of sales to alternate food outlets such as supercenters, warehouse clubs, organic and “natural” food stores, dollar stores, drug stores and e-tailers. Among other things, this shift has caused consolidation of traditional grocery chains into larger entities, often spanning the country under varying banner names. Consolidation has increased the importance of having a number one or two brand within a category, be that position national or regional. At the same time, this shift has also introduced many alternatives to traditional grocery chains. A broad sales and distribution infrastructure has also become critical for food companies, allowing them to reach all outlets selling food to consumers and expanding their growth opportunities.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution
Overview. We sell, market and distribute our products through a multiple-channel sales, marketing and distribution system to all major U.S. food channels, including sales and shipments to supermarkets, mass merchants, warehouse clubs, wholesalers, foodservice distributors and direct accounts, specialty food distributors, military commissaries and non-food outlets such as drug, dollar store chains and e-tailers. Certain of our brands, including Dash, Green Giant, Crisco, Cream of Wheat, Ac’cent, Crock Pot® seasoning mixes, Underwood, Polaner, Static Guard, New York Style, Sugar Twin and Victoria are also distributed to similar food channels in Canada. We sell, market and distribute our household brand, Static Guard, through the same sales, marketing and distribution system to many of the same customers who buy our food products as well as to other household product retailers and distributors.
We sell our products primarily through broker sales networks to supermarket chains, foodservice outlets, mass merchants, warehouse clubs, non-food outlets and specialty distributors. The broker sales network handles the sale of our products at the retail level.

- 8 -



Sales. Our sales organization is aligned by distribution channels and consists of regional sales managers, key account managers and sales persons. Regional sales managers sell our products nationwide through national and regional brokers, with separate organizations focusing on foodservice, grocery chain accounts and special markets. Our sales managers coordinate our broker sales efforts, make key account calls with buyers or distributors and supervise broker retail coverage of the products at the store level.
Our sales strategy is centered on individual brands. We allocate promotional spending for each of our brands and our regional sales managers coordinate promotions with customers. Additionally, our marketing department works in conjunction with the sales department to coordinate special account activities and marketing support, such as couponing, public relations and media advertising.
We have a national sales force that is capable of supporting our current brands and quickly integrating and supporting any newly acquired brands.
Marketing. Our marketing organization is aligned by brand and is responsible for the strategic planning for each of our brands. We focus on deploying promotional dollars where we believe the spending will have the greatest impact on sales. Marketing and trade spending support, on a national basis, typically consists of advertising trade promotions, coupons and cross-promotions with supporting products. Radio, internet, social media and limited television advertising supplement this activity.

Distribution. We distribute our products through a multiple-channel system that covers every class of customer nationwide. Due to the different demands of distribution for frozen and shelf-stable products, we maintain separate distribution systems. 
Our shelf-stable distribution network consists of six primary distribution centers in the United States, four of which are leased by us and are operated for us by a third-party logistics provider, one that is located at an owned manufacturing facility and is operated by us, and one that is located at an owned manufacturing facility and is operated by a third-party logistics provider. We also ship to certain customers direct from some of our manufacturing facilities. In Canada, Mexico and from time to time in the United States we also use public warehouse and distribution facilities for our shelf-stable products.
Our frozen distribution network consists of seven primary distribution centers in the United States and Canada, which are owned and operated by third-party logistics providers.
We believe that our distribution systems for shelf-stable and frozen products have sufficient capacity to accommodate incremental product volume. See Item 2, “Properties” for a listing of our owned and leased distribution centers and warehouses. 
In recent years, we have been negatively impacted by industry-wide increases in the cost of distribution, primarily driven by increased freight rates. We attempt to offset all or a portion of these increases through price increases and cost savings initiatives. For example, despite higher rates for freight in 2021 and 2022, we were able to offset a portion of the freight cost increases through pricing, which included both list price increases and trade spend optimization. 
Freight rates increased significantly during the fourth quarter of 2020, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, and we expect freight rates to remain elevated in 2023. To the extent that we are unable to offset present and future cost increases through pricing and cost savings initiatives, our operating results will be negatively impacted.

Customers
Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 60.5% of our net sales and approximately 60.3% of our end of the year receivables for fiscal 2022. Other than Walmart, which accounted for approximately 27.3% of our fiscal 2022 net sales, no single customer accounted for 10.0% or more of our fiscal 2022 net sales. Other than Walmart, which accounted for approximately 30.6% of our receivables as of December 31, 2022, no single customer accounted for more than 10.0% of our receivables as of December 31, 2022. During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, our net sales to foreign countries represented approximately 7.8%, 8.3% and 7.8%, respectively, of our total net sales. Our foreign sales are primarily to customers in Canada.

Seasonality
Sales of a number of our products tend to be seasonal and may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons/weather or certain other annual events. In general, our sales are higher in the first and fourth quarters.
We purchase most of the produce used to make our frozen and shelf-stable canned vegetables, pickles, relishes, peppers, tomatoes and other related specialty items during the months of June through October, and we generally purchase the majority of our maple syrup requirements during the months of April through August. Consequently, our liquidity needs are greatest during these periods.

Competition
We face competition in each of our product lines. Numerous brands and products compete for shelf space and sales, with competition based primarily on product quality, convenience, price, trade promotion, consumer promotion, brand recognition and loyalty, customer service, advertising and other activities and the ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences. We compete with numerous companies of varying sizes, including divisions or subsidiaries of larger companies. Many of these competitors have multiple product lines, substantially greater financial and other resources and may have lower fixed costs and/or be substantially less leveraged than we are. Our ability to grow our business could be impacted by the relative effectiveness of, and competitive response to, our product initiatives, product innovation, advertising and promotional activities. In addition, from time to time, we experience margin pressure in certain markets as a result of competitors’ pricing practices. 
Our products compete not only against other brands in their respective product categories, but also against products in similar or related product categories. For example, our shelf-stable pickles compete not only with other brands of shelf-stable pickles, but also with pickle products found in the refrigerated sections of grocery stores, and all our brands compete against private label products to varying degrees.

Raw Materials
We purchase raw materials, including agricultural products, oils, meat, poultry, flour, ingredients and packaging materials from growers, commodity processors, other food companies and packaging suppliers located in U.S. and foreign locations. The principal raw materials for our products include corn, peas, broccoli, oils, beans, pepper, garlic and other spices, maple syrup, wheat, corn, nuts, cheese, fruits, beans, tomatoes, peppers, meat, sugar, concentrates, molasses and corn sweeteners. Vegetables for the Green Giant brand are primarily purchased under dedicated acreage supply contracts from a number of growers prior to each growing season with the remaining demand being sourced directly from third parties. We purchase certain other agricultural raw materials in bulk or pursuant to short-term supply contracts. Most of our agricultural products are purchased between April 1 and October 31. We generally source pepper, garlic and other spices and herbs from locations other than the United States. We purchase the majority of our maple syrup from Canada. We also use packaging materials, particularly glass jars, cans, cardboard and plastic containers. The profitability of our business relies in substantial part on the prices we and our co-packers pay for these raw materials and packaging materials, which can fluctuate due to a number of factors, including changes in crop size, national, state and local government sponsored agricultural programs, export demand, currency exchange rates, natural disasters, weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons, water supply, general growing conditions, the effect of insects, plant diseases and fungi, and glass, metal and plastic prices.
Fluctuations in commodity prices can lead to retail price volatility and intensive price competition, and can influence consumer and trade buying patterns.
The cost of labor, manufacturing, energy, fuel, packaging materials and other costs related to the production and distribution of our food products can from time to time increase significantly and unexpectedly. We experienced sudden and high cost inflation in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022 and expect cost inflation to remain high and possibly continue to increase in fiscal 2023. We attempt to manage these risks by entering into short-term supply contracts and advance commodities purchase agreements, implementing cost saving measures and raising sales prices. During the past several years, our cost saving measures and sales price increases have not been sufficient to fully offset increases to our raw material, ingredient and packaging costs. To the extent we are unable to offset present and future cost increases, our operating results will be negatively impacted.

- 10 -



Production
Manufacturing. We operate twelve manufacturing facilities for our products. See Item 2, “Properties” for a listing of our manufacturing facilities.
Co-Packing Arrangements. In addition to our own manufacturing facilities, we source a significant portion of our products under “co-packing” arrangements, a common industry practice in which manufacturing is outsourced to other companies. We regularly evaluate our co-packing arrangements to ensure the most cost-effective manufacturing of our products and to utilize company-owned manufacturing facilities most effectively. Third parties located in U.S. and foreign locations produce our Baker’s Joy, B&M, Bear Creek Country Kitchens, Canoleo, Cream of Rice, Crock Pot, Joan of Arc, Le Sueur, MacDonald’s, McCann’s, New York Flatbreads, Regina, Spring Tree, Static Guard, Sugar Twin, TrueNorth and Underwood products and a portion of our B&G, Cary’s, Cream of Wheat, Crisco, Emeril’s, Green Giant, Las Palmas, Ortega and Victoria products under co-packing agreements or purchase orders. Each of our co-packers produces products for other companies as well. We believe that there are alternative sources of co-packing production readily available for the majority of our products. However, we may experience short-term or long-term disturbances in our operations and our ability to implement our business plan or meet consumer demand if we are unexpectedly required to change our co-packing arrangements or are unable to enter into additional or alternative arrangements in the future.

Trademarks and Licensing Agreements
Trademarks. We consider our trademarks, in the aggregate, to be material to our business. We protect our trademarks by registration in the United States, Canada and in other countries where we sell our products. We also oppose any infringement in key markets. Trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered. Registrations generally are for renewable, fixed terms. Examples of our trademarks and registered trademarks include Ac’cent, B&G, B&G Sandwich Toppers, B&M, Baker’s Joy, Bear Creek Country Kitchens, Brer Rabbit, Canoleo, Cary’s, Clabber Girl, Cream of Rice, Cream of Wheat, Crisco, Dash, Devonsheer, Don Pepino, Durkee, Emeril’s, Grandma’s, Green Giant, Joan of Arc, Las Palmas, Le Sueur, MacDonald’s, Mama Mary’s, Maple Grove Farms of Vermont, McCann’s, Molly McButter, New York Flatbreads, New York Style, Old London, Ortega, Polaner, Regina, Sa-són, Sclafani, Spice Islands, Spring Tree, Static Guard, Sugar Twin, Tone’s, Trappey’s, TrueNorth, Underwood, Vermont Maid, Victoria, Weber and Wright’s.
Inbound License Agreements. From time to time we enter into inbound licensing agreements. For example, we sell Weber seasonings and other flavor enhancers pursuant to a licensing agreement with Weber-Stephen Products LLC, Emeril’s brand products pursuant to a license agreement with a subsidiary of Marquee Brands, Crockpot seasoning mixes pursuant to a license agreement with Sunbeam Products, Inc., Skinnygirl fat free and sugar free salad dressings and sugar free cocktail inspired preserves pursuant to a license agreement with Better Bites, LLC, Cinnamon Toast Crunch Cinnadust seasoning blend and Cinnamon Toast Crunch creamy cinnamon spread pursuant to a license agreements with a subsidiary of General Mills, Inc., Snickers and Twix shakers seasoning blends pursuant to a license agreement with a subsidiary of Mars, Inc., Einstein Bros. everything bagel seasoning blend pursuant to a license agreement with Einstein Noah Restaurant Group, Inc., and Cream of Wheat Cinnabon®, a co-branded product, pursuant to a license agreement with a subsidiary of Cinnabon Franchisor SPV LLC.
Outbound License Agreements. We also from time to time enter into outbound license agreements for our trademarks and other intellectual property. For example, the Green Giant trademark is licensed to third parties for use in connection with their sale of fresh produce in the United States and Europe. We also license the Green Giant name and related intellectual property to General Mills for use with its sale of frozen and shelf-stable products in parts of Europe, Asia and in various other locations outside of the United States and Canada.

Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, our workforce consisted of 3,085 employees. Of that total, 2,661 employees were engaged in manufacturing, 144 were engaged in marketing and sales, 165 were engaged in warehouse and distribution and 115 were engaged in administration. Approximately 57.0% of our employees, located at six manufacturing facilities in the United States and one manufacturing facility in Mexico, are covered by collective bargaining agreements. See “—Labor Relations and Collective Bargaining Agreements” below.

(3) | Underrepresented talent refers to groups who have been denied access and/or suffered past institutional discrimination in the United States and, according to the Census and other federal measuring tools, includes African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics or Chicanos/Latinos, and Native Americans. This is revealed by an imbalance in the representation of different groups in common pursuits such as education, jobs, and housing, resulting in marginalization for some groups and individuals and not for others, relative to the number of individuals who are members of the population involved.

We have significantly increased our focus on DEI and are committed to achieving measurable improvements in results. As such, we have recently undertaken several DEI actions and initiatives, including:
In July 2020, our board of directors formed a corporate social responsibility committee that has been tasked with, among other things, oversight responsibility for our DEI efforts. Additionally, in January 2021, we formed a DEI council. The DEI Council consists of a cross-section of employees with different professional and personal backgrounds and experiences. The primary purpose of the DEI council is to provide input and guidance regarding our company’s DEI goals, strategy, metrics, initiatives, approach and communications and to partner with our company’s executive leadership team, human resources department and other employees to plan and implement DEI-related initiatives.
In January 2021, we hired a third-party DEI consultant to help us further develop our DEI strategy and priorities, educate and increase our self-awareness, assess our internal demographics and work practices, and provide guidance to our board of directors, corporate social responsibility committee, DEI council and management as we continue to make progress on our DEI efforts. In January 2022, we established five-year DEI goals, which are reflected in the tables above and about which we expect to report at least annually.
We are also working on DEI efforts in our supply chain. We are encouraging our business leaders to work closely with our procurement team to identify diverse suppliers so that they are provided with meaningful opportunities to compete for our business and so that we can expand our outreach and support to small- and large-scale suppliers from underrepresented communities.
Discrimination and Harassment. As set forth in our Code and our discrimination and harassment policy, we have a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and harassment and have several methods under which employees can report incidents, including an online and telephone hotline through which employees can report any discrimination and harassment or any other compliance and ethics concerns confidentially or anonymously and without fear of reprisal.
Compensation and Benefits. We provide competitive and equitable wages and offer comprehensive and affordable benefits to our employees.
Human Rights. Consistent with the requirements of our Code, our core values and our human rights policy, we respect the personal dignity and individual worth of every human being. At B&G Foods, it is the responsibility of each of our employees to maintain a work culture that supports human rights. Likewise, in establishing and maintaining relationships with our supply chain partners and other business partners, we expect the same commitment to high ethical standards and compliance with applicable laws, including those relating to human rights. We are committed to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to human rights, and our respect for the protection and preservation of human rights is guided by the principles set forth in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human

Rights. We have and will continue to communicate to our employees, supply chain partners and other stakeholders our commitment to human rights through our Code, our supplier code of conduct and our human rights policy.
Safety & Health at Work. We are committed to ensuring the health and safety of our employees and expect the same from our supply chain partners. We are committed to preventing accidents, injuries and illnesses related to the workplace. In January 2021, we adopted a new environmental, health and safety policy that, among other things, provides that we hold our leadership accountable for providing and maintaining safe and healthful working conditions; insist that no manufacturing facility, warehouse, office, or department will be considered properly managed regardless of its proficiency in other areas unless it maintains a safe and healthful work environment; and mandating that safety is a condition of employment and holding every employee accountable for following all prescribed work safety practices and procedures. To promote safety and health at work, we provide monthly safety and health training and assessments as well as annual internal and third-party safety and health audits.
Labor Relations and Collective Bargaining Agreements. We have collective bargaining agreements covering employees at six of our facilities in the United States, which vary in term depending on the location:

Historically, there were two unions representing 1,045 employees at our facility in Mexico, (1) the Industrial Union of Stevedore Workers, Cargo Transport Operators and Similar from the Mexican Republic and (2) the Union of Agriculture Workers at the Service of the Region. The collective bargaining agreements with the two unions did not have expiration dates but certain terms of the agreements were required to be reviewed periodically. However, in February 2023, the National Union of Frozen and Packaging Food Processors, Similar and Related, which falls under the umbrella of the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), assumed responsibility for the administration of the collective bargaining agreements covering our union employees in Mexico following a representation vote under the new Mexican labor law. We are currently negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement with CTM to replace the existing collective bargaining agreements. The new collective bargaining agreement must be subjected to a vote of the union employees in Mexico by May 1, 2023.
As noted in the table and paragraph above, four of our collective bargaining agreements, covering employees at our Cincinnati, Brooklyn and Mexico facilities, are scheduled to expire in the next twelve months. While we believe that our relations with our union employees are in general good, we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements for our Cincinnati, Brooklyn and Mexico facilities on terms satisfactory to us, or at all, and without production interruptions, including labor stoppages. At this time, however, management does not expect that the outcome of these negotiations will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Government Regulation
As a manufacturer and marketer of food and household products, our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the United States Department of Labor, the Environmental Protection Agency and various other federal, state, local and foreign authorities (including government authorities in Canada and Mexico) regarding the manufacturing, processing, packaging, storage, labeling, sale and distribution of our products and the health and safety of our employees. Our manufacturing facilities and products are subject to periodic inspection by federal, state, local and foreign authorities.
We are subject to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Food Safety Modernization Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. This comprehensive regulatory program governs, among other things, the

manufacturing, composition and ingredients, labeling, packaging and safety of food. We are also subject to the U.S. Bio-Terrorism Act of 2002 which imposes on us import and export regulations. Under the Bio-Terrorism Act we are required, among other things, to provide specific information about the food products we ship into the United States and to register our manufacturing, warehouse and distribution facilities with the FDA.
We believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with all material governmental laws and regulations and maintain all material permits and licenses relating to our operations. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that we are in full compliance with all such laws and regulations or that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations in a cost-effective manner. Failure by us to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Environmental Matters
Environmental Sustainability. As part of our commitment to being a good corporate citizen, we consider environmental sustainability to be an important strategic focus area. For instance, our manufacturing operations have a variety of initiatives in place to reduce energy usage, conserve water, improve wastewater management, reduce packaging and where possible use recycled and recyclable packaging. We evaluate and modify our manufacturing and other processes on an ongoing basis to mitigate risk and further reduce our impact on the environment, conserve water and reduce waste.
Environmental Sustainability Goals. In January 2022, we established five-year environmental sustainability goals. By 2027, we are striving to have 100% of our packaging be reusable, recyclable, compostable or biodegradable, and for 50% of our packaging to consist of recycled content. By 2027, we also aim to reduce energy usage at our manufacturing facilities by 25% and water usage by 10% and achieve “zero waste” to landfill.

The information contained on our website is not part of, and is not incorporated in, this or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC. We are currently collecting baseline data relating to our sustainable packaging, conservation of energy and water, and reduction of waste goals. Over the next year, we plan to enhance our public disclosures regarding the steps we have been taking over the years to minimize our impact on the environment, including the progress we have been making to achieve our environmental sustainability goals.
Environmental Laws and Regulations. We are also subject to environmental laws and regulations in the normal course of business. We have not made any material expenditures during the last three fiscal years in order to comply with environmental laws or regulations. Based on our experience to date, we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations (and liability for known environmental conditions) will not have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we cannot predict what environmental laws or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered or interpreted, nor can we predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with such environmental laws or regulations or to respond to such environmental claims.
