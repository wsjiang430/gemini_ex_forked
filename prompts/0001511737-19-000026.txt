Item 1. Business
Business Overview 
Overview
The Company was founded by Robert Pera in 2005. We sell equipment, and provide the related software platforms, worldwide through a network of over 100 distributors and on-line retailers. The Company has a very broad installed base with over 90 million devices sold in over 200 countries and territories around the world, since inception. 
We develop technology platforms for high-capacity distributed Internet access, unified information technology, and consumer electronics for professional, home and personal use. We categorize our solutions in to three main categories: high performance networking technology for service providers, enterprises and consumers. We target the service provider and enterprise markets through our highly engaged community of service providers, distributors, value added resellers, systems integrators and corporate IT professionals, which we refer to as the Ubiquiti Community. We target consumers through digital marketing, retail chains and to lesser extent the Ubiquiti community.
The majority of our resources consist of entrepreneurial and de-centralized research and development ("R&D"). We do not employ a traditional direct sales force, but instead drives brand awareness through online reviews and publications, our website, its distributors and the company’s user community where customers can interface directly with R&D, marketing, and support. Our technology platforms were designed from the ground up with a focus on delivering highly-advanced and easily deployable solutions that appeal to a global customer base markets. 
We offer a broad and expanding portfolio of networking products and solutions for operator-owners of wireless internet services ("WISP's"), enterprises and smart homes. Our operator-owner service provider-product platforms provide carrier-class network 
infrastructure for fixed wireless broadband, wireless backhaul systems and routing and the related software for WISP's to easily control, track and bill their customers. Our enterprise product platforms provide wireless LAN ("WLAN") infrastructure, video surveillance products, switching and routing solutions, security gateways, and other complimentary WLAN products along with a unique software platform, which enables users to control their network from one simple, easy to use software interface. Our consumer products, sold under the Ubiquiti Labs brand name, are targeted to the smart home and highly connected consumers. We believe that our products are highly differentiated due to our proprietary software, firmware expertise, and hardware design capabilities. 
We operate our business as one reportable and operating segment. Further information regarding Segments can be found in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our revenues were $1.2 billion, $1.0 billion and $865.3 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We reported net income of $322.7 million, $196.3 million and $257.5 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Refer to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part IV, Item 15 of this report for more financial information.
Industry Overview
Internet traffic worldwide has grown rapidly in recent years, driven by an increase in the number of users, increasing mobility of those users and high bandwidth applications, such as video, audio, cloud-based applications, online gaming and social networking. According to Cisco Visual Networking Index, global Internet protocol, or IP, traffic is expected to increase from 122 exabytes per month in 2017 to 396 exabytes per month in 2022, representing an approximate 26% compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, over that period. Additionally, it is estimated that there will be 3.6 networked devices per capita connected to IP networks in 2022, up from 2.4 networked devices per capita in 2017. Wired networking solutions have traditionally been used to address increasing consumer and enterprise bandwidth needs. However, the high initial capital requirements and ongoing operating costs and long market lead times associated with building and installing infrastructure for wired networks has severely limited the widespread deployment of these networks in underserved and underpenetrated markets. Wireless networks have emerged as an attractive alternative for addressing the broadband access needs of underserved and underpenetrated markets in both emerging and developed countries.
Our Technology and Products
We offer products and solutions based on our proprietary technology across multiple markets. Utilizing low cost hardware, consumer chipsets and innovative software and firmware, we seek to build price-performance solutions to address both service providers and enterprises.
Key Technology Platforms
Our current major Service Provider and carrier solutions include:
•airMAX - our airMAX platform includes proprietary protocols developed by us that contain advanced technologies for minimizing signal noise. Devices on the airMax platform, such as customer premise equipment ("CPE"), base station, and backhaul, are able to support a wireless network that can scale to hundreds of clients per base station over long distances while maintaining low latency and high throughput. 
•EdgeMAX - our EdgeMAX platform is a software and systems routing platform, powered by our full-featured EdgeOS operating system that includes advanced quality of service, firewall, dynamic routing and virtual private network functionality. 
•airFiber - our airFiber platform is a wireless backhaul point-to-point radio system, a wireless method of transmitting data to and from network backbone. Components of the airFiber products were designed to provide low latency with high throughput. Our airFiber product uses an integrated split antenna and a global positioning system to simultaneously send data packets from each side of the link.
•UFiber GPON - UFiber GPON platform, a plug and play fiber network technology, that allows users to build passive optical network deployment with minimal effort and cost. It is designed to enable internet providers ("ISPs") to quickly build high speed fiber internet networks for many users and over long distance. 
Our current major Enterprise Provider solutions include:
•UniFi -Enterprise WLAN - our UniFi- enterprise WLAN platform was designed as an enterprise Wi-Fi system, combining Wi-Fi certified hardware with software-based management controller. UniFi uses a virtual controller that allows for on-site management or remote management through the cloud, allowing for configuration of the network and individual access points.
•UniFi Protect - our UniFi protect platform is a video surveillance system that can be accessed securely from any web browser, provides detailed statistical reporting and advanced analytics and provides a management console with multiple views, versatile camera setting and customizable event recordings.
•UniFi Switch -UniFi Switch is one of our top selling categories as end customers can easily add equipment as they expand their networks. UniFi Switches deliver performance, switching, and power of ethernet ("PoE+") support for enterprise networks. 
•UniFi Security Gateway- UniFi Security Gateway extends the UniFi enterprise solutions to provide cost-effective, reliable routing and advanced network security. 
We offer a consumer product platform, called AmpliFi, which is a Wi-Fi system solution designed to serve the demands of the modern connected home. We continue to explore consumer related market opportunities and have research and development teams focused on new consumer related solutions.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development and testing of our products. Our geographically-distributed engineering team has deep expertise and experience in networking and antenna design, and we have a number of personnel with longstanding experience with network architecture and operation. We have developed and intend to continue to develop our technology in part by operating with a relatively flat reporting structure that relies on individual contributors or small development teams to develop, test and obtain feedback for our products.
As of June 30, 2019, our research and development team consisted of 626 full time equivalent employees, including contractors, located in the United States, Taiwan, China, Latvia, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Ukraine, Poland, and elsewhere. Our research and development operations work on product development of new products and new versions of existing products. Our research and development expenses were $82.1 million, $74.3 million and $69.1 million for fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. We expect that the number of our research and development personnel will increase over time and that our research and development expenses will also increase.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We use contract manufacturers, primarily located in China, Vietnam and Taiwan, to manufacture our products. Our relationships with contract manufacturers allow us to conserve working capital, reduce manufacturing costs and minimize delivery lead times while maintaining high product quality and the ability to scale quickly to handle increased order volume. Over the long term, our contract manufacturers are not required to manufacture our products for any specific period or in any specific quantity. If necessary, we expect that it would take approximately three to six months to transition manufacturing, quality assurance and shipping services to new providers.
We rely on third party components and technology to build and operate our products, and we rely on our contract manufacturers to obtain the components, subassemblies and products necessary for the manufacture of our products. While components and supplies are generally available from a variety of sources, we and our contract manufacturers currently depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for several components for our products. We and our contract manufacturers rely on purchase orders rather than long-term contracts with these suppliers. The majority of our product revenues are dependent upon the sale of products that incorporate components from Qualcomm Atheros, Inc. ("Qualcomm Atheros"). We are party to a non-exclusive license agreement with Qualcomm Atheros whereby we license certain technology that we incorporate into our products. This agreement automatically renews for successive one year periods unless the agreement is terminated by written notice of nonrenewal at least 90 days prior to the end of its then-current term. The Company has not received a termination notice as of the date of this Report. We depend on this license agreement to modify and replace firmware that Qualcomm Atheros provides with the chipsets with our proprietary firmware. While our agreement with Qualcomm Atheros remains effective, in accordance with the current terms of the agreement, either party may terminate the agreement without cause at the end of the annual contract term.
We do not stockpile sufficient chipsets to cover the time it would take to re-engineer our products to replace the Qualcomm Atheros chipsets which comprise the raw materials for our product offerings. If we need to seek a suitable second source for Qualcomm Atheros in our products, there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully source our chipsets on suitable terms, if at all. In any event, our use of chipsets from multiple sources may require us to significantly modify our designs and manufacturing processes to accommodate these different chipsets.
Tariffs
In June 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative announced new proposed tariffs for certain products imported into the U.S. from China. As of September 24, 2018, these tariffs were implemented with an initial rate of 10% impacting a portion of our products. On May 10, 2019, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative increased tariffs on certain imported goods from China to 25%. On May 13, 2019, the U.S. Trade Representative released a list of Chinese-origin products with an annual trade value of approximately $300 billion on which the U.S. proposed to impose Section 301 tariffs of up to 25%, which covered almost all remaining imports from China that are not already subject to Section 301 tariffs. On June 29, 2019 President Trump announced that trade negotiations with China are resuming and the proposed Section 301 tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, first announced on May 13, 2019, were place on hold. On August 13, 2019, it was announced the Section 301 tariffs on $300 billion would go into effect in two parts. "List 4A" on September 1, 2019 at 10% and "List 4B" on December 15, 2019 at 10%. The 
progress and continuation of the negotiations continues to be uncertain and a further escalation of the trade war remains a possibility. These tariffs have already affected our operating results and margins. As a result, current gross profit margins may not be indicative of future periods. Refer to “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our International Operations—Our business may be negatively affected by political events and foreign policy responses” for additional information.
Sales and Distribution
We sell our products and solutions globally to service providers and enterprises primarily through our extensive network of distributors, and, to a lesser extent, direct customers. During fiscal 2019, we sold our products to over 100 distributors and direct to customers through our webstores (collectively, “customers”) in over 60 countries. In fiscal 2019, two customers represented 10% or more of our revenues. In fiscal 2018 and 2017, one customer in each period represented 11% of our revenues. Refer to Note 14 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding financial data by geographic areas.
A majority of our sales are made to distributors outside the United States and we anticipate that non-U.S. sales will continue to be a significant portion of our revenues. We do not have any visibility on the location or extent of purchases of our products by individual network operators and service providers from our distributors. For further discussion of the risks associated with foreign operations, see “Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our International Operations"
Backlog
Our sales are primarily made through standard sale orders for delivery of products. Some orders remain in backlog due to concerns about the credit worthiness of the customer and/or delivery held due to inventory channel. We do not believe our backlog information is a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue of financial performance.
Competition
The markets for networking solutions for service providers, enterprise WLAN, video surveillance, microwave backhaul and machine-to-machine communications technology are highly competitive and are influenced by the following competitive factors, among others:

•total cost of ownership and return on investment associated with the solutions;
•simplicity of deployment and use of the solutions;
•ability to rapidly develop high performance integrated solutions;
•reliability and scalability of the solutions;
•market awareness of a particular brand;
•ability to provide secure access to wireless networks;
•ability to offer a suite of products and solutions;
•ability to allow centralized management of the solutions; and
•ability to provide quality product support.
We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors. We have been successful in rapidly developing high performance integrated solutions because we use individual contributors and small, experienced development teams that focus on the key needs of the markets. Our products and solutions are designed to meet the price-performance characteristics demanded by our customers to achieve a strong overall return on their investment. Our products are designed to operate in growing networks without degradation in performance or operational complexity.
In the backhaul market, our competitors include Cambium Networks, Ceragon Networks, DragonWave, MikroTîkls, Airspan, SAF Tehnika and Trango. In the CPE market, our competitors include Cambium Networks, MikroTîkls, Ruckus Wireless (Arris) and TP-LINK Technologies. In the antenna market, we primarily compete with PCTEL, ARC, ITELITE and Radio Waves.  In the enterprise WLAN market, we primarily compete with Huawei, Aerohive Networks, Aruba Networks (HPE), Ruckus Wireless (Arris), Cisco Meraki and Cisco. In the video surveillance market, we primarily compete with Axis Communications, HIKVISION, Mobotix and Vivotek. We expect increased competition from other established and emerging companies if our market continues to develop and expand. As we enter new markets, we expect to face competition from incumbent and new market participants.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and still evolving. Furthermore, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services and products are available. We seek patent protection for certain of our key concepts, components, protocols, processes and other inventions.
We have obtained a number of patents and trademarks in the United States and other countries. We have also filed, and will continue to file, patent applications and trademark applications in the United States and other countries where we believe there to be a strategic technological or business reason to do so. Any patents or trademarks issued to us now or in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and may not provide sufficiently broad protection or may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. There can be no assurance that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us or that our intellectual property rights will give us competitive advantage.
We endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and with parties with whom we do business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use or reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive with ours or that infringe on our intellectual property. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on the success of our legal actions against infringers and counterfeiters, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. For further discussion of the risks associated with intellectual property, see “Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Intellectual Property".
Employees
As of June 30, 2019, we employed and or contracted with 955 full time equivalent employees, which included 626 in research and development, 104 in sales, general and administrative and 225 in operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are party to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
