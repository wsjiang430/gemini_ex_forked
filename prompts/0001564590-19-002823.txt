 Products & Services
 We design, manufacture and distribute a diversified line of crawler-mounted lattice-boom cranes, which we sell under the Manitowoc brand name. We also design and manufacture an expansive line of top-slewing and self-erecting tower cranes, which we sell under the Potain brand name. We design and manufacture mobile telescopic cranes, which we sell under the Grove brand name, and a comprehensive line of hydraulically powered telescopic boom trucks, which we sell under the National Crane brand name. We also provide crane product parts and services and crane rebuilding, remanufacturing and training services, which are delivered under the Manitowoc Crane Care brand name. In some cases our products are manufactured for us or distributed for us under strategic alliances. Our crane products are used in a wide variety of applications throughout the world, including energy production/distribution and utility, petrochemical and industrial, infrastructure, such as road, bridge and airport construction, as well as commercial and residential construction. 
 We sell our entire product offering and full line of services in most regions of the world. Moreover, we report under a geographic reporting structure to better align with the location of our customers and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The main products we sell in each region are:   
 Lattice-boom crawler cranes. Under the Manitowoc brand name, we design, manufacture, market and sell lattice-boom crawler cranes. Lattice-boom crawler cranes weigh less and provide higher lifting capacities than a mobile telescopic crane of similar boom length. The lattice-boom crawler cranes are the only category of crane that can pick and move simultaneously with a full-rated load. The lattice-boom sections, together with the crane base, are transported to and erected at a project site. We offer our lattice-boom crawler crane customers various attachments that provide our cranes with greater capacity in terms of height, movement and lifting.

These cranes are used to lift material and equipment in a wide variety of applications, including heavy construction, bridge and highway, infrastructure and energy-related projects. These cranes are also used by the value-added crane rental industry, which serves all the aforementioned end markets. Lattice boom crawler cranes are produced in the U.S.
 Tower cranes. Under the Potain brand name, we design, manufacture, market and sell tower cranes primarily used in the commercial and residential construction end markets. Tower cranes offer the ability to lift and distribute material at the point of use, more quickly and accurately than other types of lifting machinery, without utilizing substantial square footage on the ground. We offer a complete line of tower crane products, including top slewing, luffing jib, topless, self-erecting and special cranes for large building projects. Top-slewing cranes are the most traditional form of tower cranes. Self-erecting cranes are bottom-slewing cranes which have a counterweight located at the bottom of the mast and are able to be erected, used and dismantled on job sites without assist cranes.
 Top-slewing tower cranes have a tower and multi-sectioned horizontal jib. These cranes rotate from the top of their mast and can increase in height with the project. Top-slewing cranes are transported in separate pieces and assembled at the construction site in one to three days depending on the height. These cranes are generally sold to medium to large building and construction groups, as well as to rental companies. These cranes are produced in France, Portugal, India and China.
 Topless tower cranes are a type of top-slewing crane and, unlike all others, have no cathead or jib tie-bars on the top of the mast. The cranes are utilized primarily when overhead height is constrained or in situations where several cranes are installed close together. Topless tower cranes are produced in France, Portugal, India and China.
 Luffing jib tower cranes, which are a type of top-slewing crane, have an angled rather than horizontal jib. Unlike other tower cranes which have a trolley that controls the lateral movement of the load, luffing jib cranes move their load by changing the angle of the jib. The angle is modified using either a cable controlled by a luffing winch or hydraulic cylinder. The cranes are utilized primarily in urban areas where space is constrained or in situations where several cranes are installed close together. Luffing jib tower cranes are produced in France and China.
 Self-erecting tower cranes are mounted on axles or transported on a trailer. The lower segment of the range unfolds in four sections, two for the mast and two for the jib. The smallest of our models unfolds in less than eight minutes; larger models erect in a few hours. Self-erecting cranes rotate from the bottom of their mast and are utilized primarily in low to medium rise construction and residential applications. Self-erecting tower cranes are produced in France and Italy.
 Mobile telescopic cranes. Under the Grove, Shuttlelift and National Crane brand names, we design, manufacture, market and sell mobile telescopic cranes utilized in industrial, commercial, construction and maintenance applications. Mobile telescopic cranes consist of a telescopic boom mounted on a carrier with the ability to easily move in or between job sites, with some permitted on public roadways. We currently offer the following six types of mobile telescopic cranes: rough-terrain, all-terrain, truck-mounted, telescopic crawler, industrial and boom truck.
 Rough-terrain cranes are designed to lift materials and equipment on rough or uneven terrain, and their versatility allows them to carry out many different lifts within the boundaries of given sites. These cranes cannot be driven on public roadways, and, accordingly, must be transported by truck to a job site. Rough-terrain cranes are produced in the U.S. and Italy.
 All-terrain cranes are versatile cranes designed to perform a wide range of lifts on rough or uneven terrain. These cranes are highly maneuverable and roadable at highway speeds. All-terrain cranes are produced in Germany.
 Truck-mounted cranes provide simple set-up, long reach, high capacity booms and are roadable at highway speeds. These cranes are produced in the U.S. 
 Telescopic crawler cranes are designed to lift materials on rugged terrain. These cranes consist of a telescopic boom superstructure mounted on a crawler crane chassis. These cranes combine excellent gradeability and lift capacity with 100 percent pick and carry capabilities. These cranes are purchased as complete units from a strategic manufacturer.
 Industrial cranes are designed primarily for plant maintenance, storage yard and material handling applications. These cranes allow for lifting and carrying loads on a smooth, flat surface. We manufacture industrial cranes in the U.S. under the Grove and Shuttlelift brand names.

We offer our hydraulic boom truck products under the National Crane brand name. A boom truck is a hydraulically powered telescopic crane mounted on a conventional truck chassis. Telescopic boom trucks are used primarily for lifting material on a job site. These cranes are produced in the U.S.
 Backlog, orders and customers. The year-end backlog of products includes accepted orders that have been placed on a production schedule that we expect to be shipped and billed primarily within one year. Our backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $670.6 million, $606.6 million and $323.8 million, respectively. Our backlog at the end of 2018 increased from the end of 2017 due primarily to higher customer demand for mobile hydraulic products in the Americas region, partially offset by slowing demand for our products in the EURAF and MEAP regions.
 Orders for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased 3% to $1,910.7 million from $1,864.2 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was due to strengthening demand for our mobile hydraulic and towers products in the Americas region, along with increased aftermarket demand across all regions. This was partially offset by slowing demand for new cranes in the Europe and Africa (“EURAF”) and Middle East and Asia Pacific (“MEAP”) regions. Orders were favorably impacted by $24.4 million year over year due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
 We do not have any customers that individually comprise more than 10% of our consolidated net sales.
 Manufacturing
 We operate ten manufacturing facilities (including remanufacturing facilities) that utilize a variety of processes. In general, the manufacturing process involves the fabrication and machining of raw materials, primarily steel, which are then manufactured into sub-assemblies. Sub-assemblies are then assembled with purchased components into a complete machine. In our manufacturing operations, we maintain advanced manufacturing, quality assurance and testing equipment and utilize extensive process automation. We have also invested in Product Verification Centers at our major manufacturing facilities to support new product development, testing and qualification of sub-systems and final product designs.
 We train employees dedicated to leading the implementation of The Manitowoc Way, a business system that seeks to enhance customers' experiences with our products and services. Our team is comprised of members with diverse backgrounds in quality, lean principles, finance, product and process engineering. The Manitowoc Way includes lean tools to eliminate waste from processes to provide better value for customers, and it assesses customer satisfaction and implements measures to improve customer experiences. The Manitowoc Way improvement projects have contributed to manufacturing efficiency gains, materials management improvements, steady quality improvements and reduction of lead times, as well as enabled us to free up manufacturing space.
 Raw Materials and Supplies
 We purchase a wide variety of raw materials to manufacture our products. Our primary raw materials are structural and rolled steel, which are purchased from various domestic and international suppliers. We also purchase engines and electrical equipment and other semi- and fully-processed materials. Our policy is to maintain alternate sources of supply for our critical materials and parts wherever possible, and by doing so, we mitigate the risk of being dependent on a single source for any particular raw material or supply.
Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses
 We utilize patent rights to protect our intellectual property and our
 position as a leading provider of engineered lift solutions. We hold numerous patents across the world pertaining to our products and also have pending applications for additional patents. In addition, we have various registered and unregistered trademarks, copyrights and licenses. We believe our patents, trademarks and copyrights are adequately protected in customary fashions under applicable laws. We actively enforce our patents, trademarks and copyrights and this intellectual property, in which we have invested, is collectively of material importance to our business.
Seasonality
 Our first quarter is typically the slowest quarter of the year due to seasonal conditions in the northern hemisphere impacting customer buying behavior.
