ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview
We are the largest branded marketer in North America of apparel exclusively for babies and young children. We own two of the most highly recognized and most trusted brand names in the children’s apparel industry, Carter’s and OshKosh B’gosh (or “OshKosh”), and a leading baby and young child lifestyle brand, Skip Hop.
Established in 1865, our Carter’s brand is recognized and trusted by consumers for high-quality apparel for children in sizes newborn to 14 and accessories.
Established in 1895, OshKosh is a well-known brand, trusted by consumers for apparel for children in sizes newborn to 14, with a focus on playclothes for toddlers and young children, and accessories.
Established in 2003, the Skip Hop brand re-thinks, re-energizes, and re-imagines durable childhood necessities to create higher value, superior quality, and top-performance goods for parents, babies, and toddlers. We acquired the Skip Hop brand in February 2017.

Our vision is to be the leader in baby and young children’s apparel and accessories, and to consistently provide high-quality products at a compelling value to consumers. We believe our brands provide a complementary product offering and aesthetic, and are each uniquely positioned in the marketplace. In the approximately $21 billion baby and young children's apparel market ages zero to seven in the U.S., our Carter's brand has the #1 position with approximately 14% market share and our OshKosh brand has approximately 2% market share.
Our multi-channel global business model - which includes retail store, e-commerce, and wholesale sales channels - enables us to reach a broad range of consumers around the world. As of December 29, 2018, our channels included 844 stores in the United States (excluding five temporary Skip Hop stores that were closed in January 2019), 188 stores in Canada, 42 stores in Mexico, over 17,000 wholesale locations in the United States (including department stores, national chain stores, specialty stores and discount retailers), our eCommerce sites in the United States, Canada, and China, as well as our other international wholesale accounts and licensees.
We have extensive experience in the young children’s apparel and accessories market and focus on delivering products that satisfy our consumers’ needs. Our long-term growth strategy is focused on: 

• | providing the best value and experience in young children's apparel and accessories;


• | extending the reach of our brands by improving the convenience of shopping for our products, and our omni-channel experience, as well as expanding our international operations;


• | improving profitability by strengthening distribution and direct-sourcing capabilities, as well as pricing and inventory management disciplines; and


• | investing in new sources of growth.

The three segments we use to manage and evaluate our performance are: U.S. Retail, U.S. Wholesale, and International. These segments are our operating and reporting segments. Our U.S. Retail segment consists of revenue primarily from sales of products in the United States through our retail and online stores. Similarly, our U.S. Wholesale segment consists of revenue primarily from sales in the United States of products to our wholesale partners. Finally, our International segment consists of revenue primarily from sales of products outside the United States, largely through our retail stores in Canada and Mexico, our eCommerce sites in Canada and China, and sales to our international wholesale accounts and licensees.
Additional financial and geographical information about our segments is contained in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” under Note 14, Segment Information, to the consolidated financial statements.
Our Brands
Carter's
Under our Carter’s brand, we design, source, and market products for sizes newborn to 14. Our focus is on essential, high-volume apparel products for babies and young children. We believe that a majority of our products are consumer essentials and are therefore less affected by changes in fashion trends and economic cycles. Our product categories include the following:
Baby
Carter’s brand baby products include bodysuits, pants, dresses, multi-piece knit sets, blankets, layette essentials, bibs, booties, sleep and play, rompers, and jumpers.
We sell a complete range of baby apparel products for newborns, including a preemie collection which we expanded in late 2018. These products are primarily made of cotton, including organic cotton as part of our Little Planet collection. We attribute our leading market position to our strong value proposition, brand strength, unique colors, distinctive prints, commitment to quality, and ability to manage our dedicated floor space with our wholesale customers. Our marketing programs are targeted toward experienced mothers, first-time mothers, and gift-givers. Our Carter's little baby basics product line, the largest component of our baby business, provides parents with essential products and accessories, including value-focused multi-piece sets. Our Little Collections product line consists of coordinated baby items designed for first-time mothers and gift-givers.
Carter’s is the leading brand in the baby category in the United States. In fiscal 2018, our multi-channel business model enabled our Carter’s brand to maintain its leading market share in the United States of approximately 24% in the zero to two year market, which represented nearly five times the market share of the next largest brand.
Playclothes
Carter’s brand playclothes include knit and woven apparel, primarily in cotton, for everyday use in sizes newborn to 14.
 2

We continue to focus on building our Carter’s brand in the playclothes market by developing a base of essential, high-volume products that utilize unique, special, or must-have print designs and innovative artistic applications. Our aggregate fiscal 2018 Carter’s brand playclothes market share in the United States was approximately 14% in the $14 billion young children’s playclothes market, which represents nearly two times the market share of the next largest brand.
Sleepwear
Carter’s brand sleepwear products include a full range of pajamas in cotton, fleece and poly-jersey, primarily in sizes 12 to 14 months.
As with our baby product line, we differentiate our sleepwear products by offering a wide assortment of high-quality, high-value products with distinctive designs and artwork. Our Carter’s brand is the leading brand of sleepwear for babies and young children in the United States. In fiscal 2018, in these channels, our Carter’s sleepwear brand market share was approximately 28%, which represents nearly six times the market share of the next largest brand. 
Other Products
Our other product offerings include bedding, cribs, diaper bags, footwear, gift sets, hair accessories, jewelry, outerwear, paper goods, socks, swimwear, and toys. 
We license our Carter’s, Child of Mine, Just One You, Precious Firsts, Precious Baby, Carter's little baby basics, and Simple Joys brands to partners to expand our product offerings. As of December 29, 2018, we had 10 licensees in the United States who manufacture products under these brands. These licensing partners develop and sell products through our multiple sales channels, while leveraging our brand strength, customer relationships, and designs. Licensed products provide our customers with a range of lifestyle products that complement and expand upon our baby and young children’s apparel offerings. Our license agreements require strict adherence to our quality and compliance standards and provide for a multi-step product approval process. We work in conjunction with our licensing partners in the development of their products to ensure that they fit within our brand vision of high-quality products at attractive prices to provide value to the consumer. 
We employ cross-functional product teams to focus on the development of our Carter’s brands and products. Our Carter’s brand team is skilled and experienced in identifying and developing high-volume, high-value products. The team includes members from merchandising, art, design, sourcing, product development, and planning, and follows a disciplined approach to fabric usage, color selection, and productivity. We believe this disciplined approach to product design, which includes consumer research, results in a compelling product offering to consumers, reduces our exposure to short-term trends, and supports efficient operations.
With our Carter’s brands, we believe that we continuously strengthen our brand image with the consumer by differentiating our products through fabric and material improvements, new artistic applications, and new packaging and presentation strategies. We also attempt to differentiate our products and presentation through in-store fixturing, branding, signage, photography, and advertising, both in our stores and with our major wholesale customers. 
OshKosh
Under our OshKosh brand, we design, source, and market apparel with an emphasis on high-quality playclothes for children in sizes newborn to 14. Our OshKosh brand is generally positioned towards an older age segment and at slightly higher average prices relative to the Carter’s brand. We believe our OshKosh brand has significant brand name recognition, which consumers associate with high-quality, durable, and authentic playclothes for young children. Our product categories include the following:
Playclothes
Our OshKosh brand is best known for its playclothes products. OshKosh brand playclothes include denim apparel products with multiple wash treatments and coordinating garments, overalls, woven bottoms, knit tops, and bodysuits for everyday use in sizes newborn to 14. Our fiscal 2018 OshKosh brand playclothes market share in the United States was approximately 3% of the $14 billion young children’s playclothes market.
Other Products
The remainder of our OshKosh brand product offering includes baby, sleepwear, outerwear, footwear, hosiery, and accessories.
 3

Additionally, we partner with a number of licensees to extend the reach of our OshKosh brand. As of December 29, 2018, we had five licensees in the United States selling OshKosh apparel and accessories. Our licensed products provide our customers and consumers with a range of OshKosh products including outerwear, socks, shoes, and accessories.
As with our Carter’s brands, we employ cross-functional product teams to focus on the development of our OshKosh brand and products, including members from merchandising, art, design, sourcing, product development, and planning, and these teams follow a disciplined approach to fabric usage, color selection, and productivity. We believe this disciplined approach to product design, which includes consumer research, results in a compelling product offering to consumers, reduces our exposure to short-term trends, and supports efficient operations.
As with our Carter’s brands, we believe that we strengthen our OshKosh brand image with the consumer by differentiating our products through fabric and material improvements, new artistic applications, and new packaging and presentation strategies. We also attempt to differentiate our products and presentation through in-store fixturing, branding and signage packages, and advertising, both in our stores and with our major wholesale customers.
Skip Hop
Under our Skip Hop brand, we design, source, and market products that are sold primarily to families with young children. Our Skip Hop brand is best known for its diaper bags, which we believe combine innovative functionality with attractive design. The Skip Hop brand offering also includes products for playtime, travel, mealtime, kid’s bags, bathtime, and homegear.
With Skip Hop, we believe we have acquired a global lifestyle brand. Skip Hop’s core philosophy and positioning begins and ends with its brand promise -- “Must-Haves * Made Better.” This reflects the brand’s goal of creating innovative, smartly designed, and highly functional essentials for parents, babies, and toddlers. The Skip Hop team includes in-house design and creative teams, which are made up of people who strive to improve the functionality, form, and design of must-have baby and young child products. We believe the brand is positioned as a competitively priced source of iconic products that offer greater value through innovation and design. We have recently introduced Skip Hop brand products in our retail stores, and have increased investments in in-store fixturing, branding, and signage packages, along with digital advertising, to further strengthen the position of the Skip Hop brand.
Our Sales Channels
We sell our Carter’s, OshKosh, and Skip Hop branded products through multiple channels, both in the United States and globally.
U.S. Retail
Our U.S. retail sales channel includes sales of our products through our U.S. retail stores and eCommerce sites.
Our U.S. retail stores are generally located in high-traffic strip shopping centers in or near major cities or in outlet centers that are near densely-populated areas. We believe our brand strength and our assortment of products have made our retail stores a destination for consumers who shop for young children’s apparel and accessories.
We operate retail stores in three different formats: 

• | Carter’s stand-alone stores, which carry an extensive assortment of Carter’s baby and young children’s apparel, accessories, and gift items, and average approximately 4,200 square feet per location.


• | OshKosh stand-alone stores, which carry a wide assortment of OshKosh young children’s apparel, accessories, and gift items, and average approximately 4,600 square feet per location.


• | Dual-branded stores, which include:


• | “Co-branded” locations, which consist of single retail stores that offer products from our Carter’s and Oshkosh brands, and average approximately 5,000 square feet per location; and


• | “Side-by-side” locations, which consist of adjacent retail stores for our Carter’s and OshKosh brands that are connected, and average approximately 7,300 square feet per location.

We also sell a selection of Skip Hop products at our retail store locations and open temporary Skip Hop stores from time to time to sell select Skip Hop merchandise.
As of December 29, 2018, in the United States we operated 418 Carter’s stand-alone stores, 107 OshKosh stand-alone stores, 163 “side-by-side” locations, 153 “co-branded” locations. In addition, as of February 25, 2019, we had three temporary Skip Hop stores.

We regularly assess potential new retail store locations and closures based on demographic factors, retail adjacencies, competitive factors, and population density, as part of a rigorous real estate portfolio optimization process.
We also sell our products through our online U.S. eCommerce sites at www.carters.com, www.oshkoshbgosh.com, www.oshkosh.com, and www.skiphop.com. 
In both our retail stores and eCommerce sites, we focus on the customer experience through store and eCommerce site design, visual aesthetics, clear product presentation, and experienced customer service. We strive to create a seamless omni-channel experience as more fully described below under “Our Customer and Marketing Strategy.”
U.S. Wholesale
Our U.S. wholesale channel includes sales of our products to our U.S. wholesale accounts.
Our Carter’s brand wholesale customers in the United States include major retailers, such as, in alphabetical order, Costco, JCPenney, Kohl’s, and Macy’s. Additionally, we sell our Child of Mine brand at Walmart, our Just One You brand at Target, and our Simple Joys brand on Amazon.
Our OshKosh brand wholesale customers in the United States include major retailers, such as, in alphabetical order, Costco, JCPenney, and Kohl’s.
Our Skip Hop brand wholesale customers in the United States include major retailers, such as, in alphabetical order, Amazon, Buy Buy Baby, and Target.
We collaborate with our wholesale customers to provide a consistent, high-level of service, and to drive growth through eCommerce, replenishment, product mix, and brand presentation. We also have frequent meetings with the senior management of key accounts to align on strategic growth plans.
International
Our International segment includes sales of our products through our retail stores in Canada and Mexico, and eCommerce sites in Canada and China, and to international wholesale accounts. In addition, we license our Carter’s and OshKosh brands to international licensees. These licensees sell our products through branded retail and online stores, as well as to wholesale accounts, within their territories. Our International segment also includes sales of our products to these licensees, and royalty income based on sales made by certain licensees.
As of December 29, 2018, in Canada we operated 188 co-branded Carter’s and OshKosh retail stores and an eCommerce site at www.cartersoshkosh.ca, in Mexico we operated 42 retail stores and franchisees operated an additional 16 retail stores, and in China we operated an eCommerce site.
In addition, as of December 29, 2018, we had approximately 40 international licensees who operated in over 80 countries.
Our Customer and Marketing Strategy
For all of our brands, our marketing is predominantly focused on driving brand preference and engagement with millennial customers, including through strengthening and evolving our digital programs. Our omni-channel approach allows the customer to experience the brand as a seamless shopping experience in the channel of their choice. For instance, our website capabilities have been designed to optimize the experience for consumers shopping on a mobile device and, during fiscal 2017, we launched our mobile application in the United States.
We operate our Rewarding Moments loyalty and rewards program in the United States to drive customer traffic, sales, and brand loyalty. This program is integrated across our U.S. retail stores and online businesses. During fiscal 2018, our U.S. retail sales were predominantly made to customers who are members of Rewarding Moments. 
Our investments in marketing, our loyalty program, and new technologies are focused on acquiring new customers, developing stronger connections with our existing customers, and extending their relationship with our brands. Our goal is to have the most top-of-mind, preferred brands in the young children’s market and to connect with a diverse, digitally-savvy customer.

Our Global Sourcing Network
We do not own any manufacturing facilities. We source all of our garments and other products from a global network of third party suppliers, primarily located in Asia. The remainder of our products are sourced primarily through Central America. During fiscal 2018, approximately 80%, based on cost, of our product was sourced from Cambodia, China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh. 
Our sourcing operations are based in Hong Kong in order to facilitate better service and accommodate the volume of manufacturing in Asia. Our Hong Kong office acts as an agent for substantially all of our production in Asia and monitors production at manufacturers’ facilities to ensure quality control, compliance with our manufacturing specifications and social responsibility standards, as well as timely delivery of finished garments to our distribution facilities. We also have representative offices in Cambodia and Bangladesh to help support these efforts. 
Prior to placing production, and on a recurring basis, we conduct assessments of political, social, economic, trade, labor and intellectual property protection conditions in the countries in which we source our products. In connection with the manufacture of our products, manufacturers purchase raw materials including fabric and other materials (such as linings, zippers, buttons, and trim) at our direction. Prior to commencing the manufacture of products, samples of raw materials are sent to us for approval. We regularly inspect and supervise the manufacture of our products in order to ensure timely delivery, maintain quality control and monitor compliance with our manufacturing specifications and social responsibility standards. We also inspect finished products at the factory site.
We generally arrange for the production of products on a purchase order basis with completed products manufactured to our design specifications. We assume the risk of loss predominantly on a Freight-On-Board (F.O.B.) basis when goods are delivered to a shipper and are insured against losses arising during shipping.
As is customary, we have not entered into any long-term contractual arrangements with any contractor or manufacturer. We believe that the production capacity of foreign manufacturers with which we have developed, or are developing, a relationship is adequate to meet our production requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that alternative foreign manufacturers are readily available. 
We expect all of our suppliers shipping to the United States to adhere to the requirements of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (“C-TPAT”) program, including standards relating to facility security, procedural security, personnel security, cargo security, and the overall protection of the supply chain. In the event a supplier does not comply with our C-TPAT requirements, or if we have determined that the supplier will be unable to correct a deficiency, we may move that supplier’s product through alternative supply chain channels or we may terminate our business relationship with the supplier.
Corporate Responsibility
We have adopted a factory on-boarding program that allows us to assess each factory’s compliance with our social responsibility standards before we place orders for product with that factory, including factories that were used by companies that we acquire. Additionally, we regularly assess the manufacturing facilities we use through periodic on-site facility inspections, including the use of independent auditors to supplement our internal staff. We use audit data and performance results to suggest improvements when necessary, and we integrate this information into our on-going sourcing decisions. Our vendor code of conduct, with which we require our factories to comply, covers employment practices, such as wages and benefits, working hours, health and safety, working age, and discriminatory practices, as well as environmental, ethical, and other legal matters. 
Our Global Distribution Network 
The majority of all finished goods manufactured for us is shipped to our distribution facilities or to designated third party facilities for final inspection, allocation, and reshipment to customers. The goods are delivered to our customers and us by independent shippers. We choose the form of shipment based upon needs, costs, and timing considerations.
In the United States, we operate two distribution centers in Georgia: an approximately 1.1 million square-foot multi-channel facility in Braselton and a 505,000 square-foot facility in Stockbridge. We also outsource distribution activities to third party logistics providers in California. Our distribution center activities include receiving finished goods from our vendors, inspecting those products, preparing them for retail and wholesale presentation, and shipping them to our wholesale customers, retail stores, and eCommerce customers.
 6

Internationally, we operate directly or outsource our distribution activities to third party logistics providers in Canada, China, United Kingdom, and Mexico to support our international wholesale accounts, international licensees, international eCommerce operations, and Canadian and Mexican retail store network.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
Our products are subject to regulation of and regulatory standards with respect to quality and safety set by various governmental authorities around the world, including in the United States, Canada, China, Mexico, and the European Union. Our operations also are subject to various international trade agreements and regulations. 
We are also subject to various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that govern our activities, operations, and products, including data privacy, truth-in-advertising, accessibility, customs, wage and hour laws and regulations, and zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers generally and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and e-commerce sites. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations may result in substantial monetary penalties and criminal sanctions. 
Competition
The baby and young children’s apparel and accessories market is highly competitive. Competition is generally based on a variety of factors, including comfort and fit, value, pricing, experience, and selection. Both branded and private label manufacturers as well as specialty apparel retailers aggressively compete in the baby and young children’s apparel market. Our primary competitors include: The Children's Place, Gap, and Old Navy (specialty apparel); Cat & Jack and Garanimals (private label); and Disney, Gerber, and Nike (national brand). Because of the highly-fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with many small manufacturers and retailers. We believe that the strength of our brand names, combined with our breadth of product offerings, distribution footprint, and operational expertise, position us well against these competitors.
Seasonality and Weather
We experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales and profitability due to the timing of certain holidays and key retail shopping periods, which generally have resulted in lower sales and gross profit in the first half of our fiscal year versus the second half of the year. Accordingly, our results of operations during the first half of the year may not be indicative of the results we expect for the full fiscal year. In addition, our business is susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions, which could influence customer trends, consumer traffic, and shopping habits. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool temperatures during the summer season could affect the timing of, and reduce or shift, demand.
