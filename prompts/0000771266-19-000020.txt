Item 1. | Business

Introduction
We were incorporated in Delaware in 1984 and are a leading inventor, developer, manufacturer and seller of components and systems for industrial, public safety and consumer augmented ("AR") and virtual reality ("VR") wearable headsets, soldier, avionic and military armored vehicle applications, 3D optical inspection systems and training & simulation markets.
The components that we offered for sale in 2018 consisted of our proprietary miniature active-matrix liquid crystal displays (“AMLCD”), liquid crystal on silicon (“LCOS”) displays / Spatial Light Modulators (“SLMs”), organic light emitting diode (“OLED”) displays, application specific integrated circuits (“ASICs”), backlights, optical lenses and audio

integrated circuits (“IC”). We refer to our AMLCD as “CyberDisplay®”, our LCOS displays/SLMs as “Time Domain ImagingTM technology”, our OLED as “Lightning™ Displays” and our audio IC as “Whisper® Chip.” Our transmissive AMLCDs are designed in Westborough, Massachusetts, U.S.A., have initial manufacturing steps performed in Asia and then are completed in our facilities in Westborough, Massachusetts, U.S.A. Our reflective LCOS microdisplays are designed in Dalgety Bay, Scotland, U.K., have initial manufacturing steps performed in Asia and are completed in our facilities in Dalgety Bay, Scotland, U.K. Our OLED displays are designed in our San Jose, California, U.S.A. facility and have initial manufacturing steps performed in Asia and then are completed by us in our facilities in Westborough, Massachusetts, U.S.A. In 2019 we anticipate that our OLED displays will be completely manufactured in Asia. Our displays provide either color or monochrome images and are offered in a variety of sizes and resolutions. The display driver ASICs we offer are designed in our San Jose, California facility and are the electronic interfaces between our displays and the products into which the displays are incorporated. The optical lenses and backlights we offer are based on either our proprietary designs or designs we license from third parties. Our licensed optical lenses are subject to agreements that have termination dates and are therefore subject to renewals. Our audio technologies are developed at our San Jose, California audio lab. The Whisper Chip, ASICs, optical lenses, and backlights are manufactured by third parties based on our purchase orders.
Our components are sold separately or in various levels of integration. For example, we offer a display as a single product, a display module which includes a display, an optical lens and backlight contained in either plastic or metal housings, a binocular display module which has two displays, lenses and backlights, and a higher-level assembly which has additional components for military applications. Current products which include our components are augmented reality consumer wearable devices for sports and fitness and virtual reality consumer products for recreational and sport drones; military devices such as thermal weapon sights and fighter pilot helmets; and industrial and public safety devices such as firefighter thermal camera enabled masks. Our reflective display products are also configured as SLMs and are used in industrial equipment for 3D optical inspection. Our OLED display was first introduced in 2017 and our sales of OLED displays in 2018 have primarily been for sample purposes or customer development programs.
We have designed and offered systems that are focused on the emerging enterprise and consumer markets for head-worn, hands-free voice and gesture controlled wireless computing and communication devices. Our systems connect via a wire, Bluetooth or WiFi to a smartphone or similar device in order to access or transmit information from or to the Internet or devices that are in close proximity. A feature of our enterprise systems is the ability to contact a resource, referred to as the “Remote Expert”, who can help in resolving problems. The system user and the Remote Expert can be in different locations so while the system user may be in a hazardous location the Remote Expert may be in a relatively safe location. This allows companies that purchase enterprise systems the ability to leverage their in-house experts to the technicians in the field. We currently license our systems under agreements which may include a royalty payable to us and a purchase and supply agreement which requires our customer to buy our components for the system. These systems include our components and a variety of commercially available software packages and our proprietary software. Our business model is to license our concept systems or technologies to branded OEM customers who wish to develop and market head-worn products for both mobile enterprise and consumer applications.
We offer SOLOS® smart glasses, which are sunglasses with AR capabilities designed for the health and fitness market. SOLOS is our proprietary design and contains our display, optic, and ASIC technologies and internally developed software. SOLOS smart glasses are hands-free head-worn devices that obtain information from sensors or the internet via a smartphone and displays the information on the sunglass lens. SOLOS smart glasses uses Bluetooth, WiFi or ANT+ to connect to devices. For example, a cyclist user can see the information being provided by the bike sensors such as speed, cadence or watts produced, can access the Internet for GPS location or can access an Internet training application. SOLOS is designed in our Westborough, Massachusetts U.S.A. facility. We provide our components to a contract manufacturer in Asia who assembles SOLOS.
Our NVIS, Inc. (“NVIS”) subsidiary is a designer and manufacturer of military and industrial head-mounted virtual reality products and simulated military equipment located in Reston, Virginia U.S.A. Depending on the size of the order NVIS’s products are either manufactured in its Reston, Virginia facility or by a contract manufacturer in the U.S.A. NVIS products allow customers to visualize and interact with simulated 3D environments and equipment for training purposes. Our customers develop high-fidelity training and simulation applications that require high-performance visuals, intuitive controls, and unsurpassed customer support. Some of NVIS’s products include our LCOS displays.

Industry Overview
Wearable Products
The introduction and wide acceptance of the smartphone has generated advances in many technologies including smaller and cheaper electronic components, voice search engines and wireless 4G networks. Smartphone adoption has also been the catalyst for the development of software for a wide-range of applications. Leveraging off of these advances and the growth of cloud computing, a new category of “Wearable” products is emerging that provides access to data. This emerging category of wearable systems can be used for hundreds of different applications by enterprise workers, public safety officials and consumers, bringing ever-increasing productivity, fun and convenience. Through the use of Wearable products both workers and consumers can have access to their digital files, the Internet, phone, e-mail, etc., enabling an “always connected” work-style and lifestyle. We believe that advances in wearables will continue to make the “always connected” life increasingly convenient and more productive by providing easier access to and control of the information accessible through our electronic devices.
Wearable products include body-worn devices such as sensors, scanners and terminals which are sold to enterprise markets to improve worker productivity, and to the consumer market to monitor health and fitness metrics such as heart rate, speed and temperature. The user interface for these devices is typically either a key pad or a touch-screen. Some Wearable products include voice recognition software as an additional feature to allow the user to navigate the device’s interface “hands-free” instead of using a traditional mouse, touch-screen or keypad. We believe wireless smartphone makers are looking to create products that work as a complement to the smartphone or will eventually replace the smartphone with more convenient configurations. Wireless network companies are encouraging the development of more products that utilize their network capacity and other companies are developing products which provide continuous access to social media outlets. In order for the markets for these new products to develop and grow, devices must further advance and application software that exploits the devices’ new features and functions must be developed. Device improvements include smaller, higher resolution displays, lower power processors, longer-life batteries, compact optics and software including voice recognition and noise cancellation.

Display Products
Small form factor displays are used in military, consumer, and industrial products such as thermal weapon sights, safety equipment, virtual and augmented reality gaming, training and simulation products and metrology tools. In order for these markets to develop and grow, advances and investment in application software, optics and wireless communications systems with greater bandwidth and increased functionality will be necessary. We believe small form factor displays will be a critical component in the development of these markets as these systems must provide high resolution images without compromising the portability of the product.
There are several microdisplay technologies commercially available including transmissive, reflective and emissive. We believe we are the only company that offers all of these technologies. Our principal display products are miniature high density color or monochrome AMLCDs that range from approximately 320 x 240 resolution to 2048 x 2048 resolution and are sold in either a transmissive or reflective format. In 2018 we began shipping samples of our emissive OLED display with a resolution of 2048 x 2048 (“2K x 2K”). We sell our displays individually or in combination with our other components assembled in a unit. For example, we offer a display as a product, a module product unit that includes a single display, backlight and optics in a plastic housing, a binocular display module product that includes two displays, backlights and optics in a plastic housing, and a Higher-Level Assembly ("HLA") that contains a display, light emitting diode based illumination, optics, and electronics in a sealed housing, primarily for military applications.
Our transmissive display products, which we refer to as CyberDisplay® products, utilize high quality, single crystal on silicon, which is the same high quality silicon used in conventional integrated circuits. This single crystal silicon is not grown on glass; rather, it is first formed on a silicon wafer and patterned into an integrated circuit (including the active matrix, driver circuitry and other logic circuits) in an integrated circuit foundry. These processes enable the manufacture of miniature active matrix circuits, that are comparable to higher resolution displays relative to passive and other active matrix displays that are fabricated on glass. Our foundry partners fabricate integrated circuits for our CyberDisplay displays in their foundries in Taiwan. The fabricated wafers are then returned to our facilities, where we lift the integrated circuits off the silicon wafers and transfer them to glass using our proprietary Wafer Engineering technology. The transferred integrated circuits are then processed, packaged with liquid crystal and assembled into display panels at our Display Manufacturing Center in Westborough, Massachusetts.
Our proprietary technology enables the production of transparent circuits on a transparent substrate, in contrast to conventional silicon circuits, which are on an opaque substrate. Our CyberDisplay products' imaging properties are a result of the inclusion of a liquid crystal layer between the active matrix integrated circuit glass and the transparent cover glass. We believe our manufacturing process offers several advantages over conventional active matrix LCD manufacturing approaches with regard to small form factor displays, including:

• | Greater miniaturization;


• | Higher pixel density;


• | Full color capability;


• | Lower power consumption; and


• | Higher brightness

The color CyberDisplay products we sell generate colors by using color filters with a white backlight. Color filter technology is a process in which display pixels are patterned with materials, which selectively absorb or transmit the red, green or blue colors of light.
Our reflective LCOS display products are miniature high density, dual mode color sequential/monochrome reflective microdisplays with resolutions which range from approximately 1280 x 720 pixels ("720P") resolution to 2K x 2K resolution. These displays are manufactured at our facility in Scotland, U.K. Our reflective displays are based on a proprietary, high-speed, ferroelectric liquid crystal on silicon ("FLCOS") platform. Our digital software and logic-based drive electronics combined with the very fast switching binary liquid crystal enables our microdisplay to process images purely digitally and create red, green and blue gray scale in the time domain. This architecture has major advantages in visual performance over other liquid crystal, organic light-emitting diode and microelectromechanical systems-based technologies: precisely controlled full color or monochrome gray scale is achieved on a matrix of undivided high fill factor pixels, motion artifacts are reduced to an insignificant level and there are no sub-pixels, no moving mirrors and no analog conversions to detract from the quality of the image.
The FLCOS device is comprised of two substrates. The first is a pixelated silicon-based CMOS substrate which is manufactured by our foundry partner using conventional silicon integrated circuit lithography processes. The silicon substrate forms the display's backplane, serving as both the active matrix to drive individual pixels and as a reflective 
4

mirror. The second substrate is a front glass plate. Between the backplane and the front glass substrate is a ferroelectric liquid crystal material which, when switched, enables the incoming illumination to be modulated.
An OLED has the ability to emit light when an electrical current is flowing through its electroluminescent layers as opposed to our AMLCD which requires a separate light source. Our OLED displays have a top-emitting structure built on opaque silicon integrated circuits rather than on glass. Light from an OLED appears fairly evenly distributed in the forward directions and so a slight movement of the eye does not perceive the change in the image brightness or color, and therefore an OLED typically has a wider viewing angle than an AMLCD. 
Our proprietary technology is in the design of the integrated circuits or “back plane”. We have engaged foundry services for the fabrication of the Lightning OLED displays. We believe this outsourcing model allows us to leverage existing infrastructure to obtain lower cost manufacturing and avail ourselves of manufacturing technology improvements as they occur.
Our 2k x 2k Lightning display addresses the most challenging technical hurdles with virtual reality systems, including the visible “screen door” effect, which is due to insufficient display resolution, bulky size, and nausea or dizziness from motion-to-photon latency, as well as heat-build-up caused by high power consumption. We combine the one-inch diagonal Lightning OLED microdisplay (which is less than 1/10 the size of direct view displays for the same resolution) with our patented Pancake™ optics (< 20 mm thick) to enable system manufacturers to create much smaller and thinner mobile VR systems. The Lightning OLED microdisplay has almost zero latency (about 10 microseconds) and an industry leading 120-Hz frame rate. At the same time, Lightning’s distinctive design enables low power consumption, even at 120-Hz.
By offering transmissive, reflective and emissive microdisplay technologies, we can uniquely support whichever technology is best suited for a given application. Transmissive and reflective AMLCDs are typically used in bright light conditions as their brightness can be modulated over a wide range by controlling the backlight operation. OLED technology displays currently have less brightness range, but offer superior contrast and response time characteristics and are better suited in an immersive products environment that blocks out ambient light.
Optical Lenses and Backlights
We offer a variety of optical lenses some of which we have developed internally and others we license the rights to sell the lenses. We also offer a variety of backlights, some of which we have developed internally and some of which are “off-the-shelf” components. The lenses come in a variety of sizes with the smallest being our Pupil, followed by our Pearl, Prism, Pantile, and Pancake lenses. The different sizes of lenses give us and our customers design flexibility when creating headset systems. There is a trade-off between the lens size and the size of the perceived image to the viewer. For example, a Pearl lens will provide the viewer with an image approximately equivalent to what the viewer would see looking at a smartphone, whereas a Prism lens will provide the viewer with an image approximately equivalent to what the viewer would see looking at a tablet. A Pearl lens, however, is smaller than a Prism and would enable a more fashionable design. Therefore, a customer designing a consumer-oriented product may choose a Pearl lens but a customer designing an enterprise-oriented product might choose a Prism Lens. We use third parties to manufacture these lenses.
Whisper Chip
Today, many devices are equipped to use voice as an input or control method for the device. Most users find, however, that today’s speech recognition on their devices is not satisfactory because it does not work reliably in the variety of noisy environments we find ourselves in during the course of our days. The root cause of the low reliability is that the noise canceling software used in today’s devices is not always effective. The Whisper Chip addresses this problem. It is designed to enhance the performance of existing audio systems and speech recognition engines by allowing the speaker’s voice to be clearly “heard” by the listener, whether the “listener” is a person or a machine. The Whisper Chip incorporates our Voice Extraction™ Filter ("VEF"). VEF is a patented approach to singulating the voice signal without distorting it. The Whisper Chip is an all-digital solution that runs at 16MHz, consumes less than 12mW of power and replaces the CODEC so no ADC or DAC is needed. The Whisper Chip is 4 x 4 mm in size and accepts up to four (4) digital microphone inputs. We use third parties to manufacture the Whisper Chip.

Headset Systems
Our headset systems include:

• | Augmented reality health and fitness sunglasses, called SOLOS smart glasses, that have voice and audio capabilities, and a Pupil display module which overlays situational information on the glasses;


• | Industrial headset reference design, called Golden-i, which is a complete head-worn computer that connects to the internet wirelessly and includes an optical pod with one of our display products, a microprocessor, battery, camera, memory and various commercially available software packages that we license;


• | Industrial headset reference design, called Golden-i™ Infinity, which is a device that attaches to a pair of safety glasses, includes an optical pod with one of our display products and a camera and is operated primarily through the use of voice; and


• | Training and simulation head-mounted display with a 1280 x 1024 full color display with either a 50° diagonal field-of-view in see-through or immersive modes or a stereoscopic 60° diagonal field-of-view, built-in microphone and stereo headphones for professional augmented and virtual reality applications.

Except for Golden-i Infinity, our headsets receive, or transmit data, from or to the Internet by interfacing with a smartphone or similar device via WiFi or Bluetooth. They can also receive information from devices in close proximity using ANT+. Golden-i Infinity connects to a smartphone or similar device via wire to leverage the processing capabilities of the smartphone and make the device as small and light as possible. The display module or optical pod allows users to view the information such as Internet data, emails, text messages, maps or biometric data (heart rate), and situational data (speed, distance traveled, watts produced) at a “normal” size because of our specialized optics. Our industrial headsets provide the capability of viewing technical diagrams, by enabling the user to zoom in to see finer details or zoom out to see a larger perspective. Our headsets utilize operating system software we developed or outsource.
For commercial users, we believe the following features can drive adoption through improved productivity:

• | User can access cloud based systems to obtain up-to-date work instructions, checklists, diagrams or videos in order to perform the required tasks;


• | Our systems enable the user to stream video to a “subject matter expert” who can see what the user is doing and can make recommendations; and


• | By virtue of using a head mounted system that is primarily voice controlled the user has the ability to use both hands.

Strategy
Our commercial product strategy is to invent, develop, manufacture and sell the leading-edge critical components that enable our customers to create differentiated wearable products in their respective markets, to license wearable headset computing system designs to customers who wish to offer their own branded products that enable a better “always connected” experience and to develop and offer our branded SOLOS smart glasses to the health and fitness market, our Golden-i headset for the enterprise market and headsets for the training and simulation market. Our military strategy is to work primarily with the U.S. military to determine its program needs several years in the future and develop products which meet those needs. The critical elements of our strategy include:

• | Broad Portfolio of Intellectual Property. We believe that our extensive portfolio of patents, trade secrets and non-patented know-how provides us with a competitive advantage in our markets and we have been accumulating, either by internal efforts or through acquisition, a significant patent and know-how portfolio. We own, exclusively license or have the exclusive right to sublicense approximately 300 patents and patent applications issued and/or pending worldwide. An important piece of our strategy is to continue to accumulate valuable patented and non-patented technical know-how relating to our microdisplays as well as other critical technologies for advanced wearable services. 


• | Maintain Our Technological Leadership. We are a recognized leader in the design, development and manufacture of high resolution microdisplays and modules which incorporate our microdisplays with optics and ASICs and our audio IC, Whisper Chip We believe our ability to develop components, software and noise canceling technology and innovative headset system designs enhances our opportunity to grow within our targeted markets. By continuing to invest in research and development, we are able to add to our expertise as a system and components supplier for our original equipment manufacturer (our “OEM”) customers, and we intend to continue to focus our development efforts on proprietary wearable computing systems. 

6


• | Understand Our Customer Needs. We believe our system know-how, be it a consumer, industrial or military system is a compelling reason customers choose us as their supplier. Unlike many of our competitors we offer a range of display technologies, optics, backlights, ASICs, noise cancellation as either an individual component or in a system. Our system understanding enables us to offer our customers valuable engineering services to solve their issues and reduce time to market for their products. 


• | Internally Manufactured Products and Use of Third Party Manufacturing. We design and manufacture our transmissive and reflective display products in facilities that we lease and manage. Our OLED displays are designed by us but we use foundry service to perform a substantial portion of the manufacturing. Our optical lenses, backlights and ASICs are manufactured by third parties who are only authorized to manufacture and supply these products to us. The use of these third party manufacturers reduces our investments in plant and equipment and working capital for new products and enables us to update designs as trends change.


• | Strong U.S. Government Program Support. We perform research and development contracts for U.S. government agencies, such as the U.S. Night Vision Laboratory and the U.S. Department of Defense Under these contracts, the U.S. Government funds a portion of our efforts to develop next-generation microdisplay related technologies for aviation systems such as fighter pilot helmets, soldier centric systems such as thermal weapon sights, training and simulation systems and military armored vehicles. This enables us to supplement our internal research and development budget with additional funding. 

Markets and Customers
Wearable products
Our business model is to generate revenues by selling components to customers who offer consumer, industrial or military products, license our system designs and know-how and to sell SOLOS smart glasses and Golden-i systems directly. We may also receive development fees from customers to help them integrate our technology into their products. The sale of SOLOS smart glasses is relatively new and to date the revenues have been de minimis. We have licensed our wearable system technologies to Lenovo New Vision, RealWear, Inc. and Fujitsu Limited for enterprise wearable systems. Our license agreements may include a license fee, a per unit royalty and a supply agreement which requires the customer to buy components from us in order to maintain the license.
Display Products
We currently sell our display products to our customers in various configuration including but not limited to a single display component, a module that includes a display, optic, backlight and focus mechanism and electronics, a binocular display module that includes two displays, lenses, and backlights, and as higher level assemblies or HLA for military customers. An HLA is similar to a module but includes additional components such as an eye cup specific to a military application.
We have sold our AMLCD products to Collins Aerospace, Elbit, Raytheon Company, DRS RSTA Inc., BAE Systems (directly and through a third party QiOptiq), and ITT for use in military applications, to Google, Vuzix, and RealWear for enterprise wearable products, and to Scott Safety for public safety applications.
In order for our display products to function properly in their intended applications, ASICs generally are required. Several companies have designed ASICs to work with our display products and our customers can procure these chip sets directly from the manufacturer or through us.
For fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, sales to military customers, excluding research and development contracts, as a percentage of total revenue were 36%, 48% and 24%, respectively.
For fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, research and development revenues, primarily from multiple contracts with various U.S. governmental agencies, accounted for approximately 20%, 11% and 7%, respectively, of our total revenues.
Product Development
We believe that continued introduction of new products in our target markets is essential to our growth. Our commercial products tend to have one to three year life cycles. We have assembled a group of highly skilled engineers who work internally as well as with our customers to continue our product development efforts. Our primary development efforts are focused on displays, military products, noise cancellation, optics and headset system designs.

Component Products
Our display product development efforts are focused towards continually enhancing the resolution, performance and manufacturability of our display products. A principal focus of this effort is the improvement of manufacturing processes for very small active matrix pixels with our eight-inch manufacturing line. The pixel size of our current transmissive display products ranges from 6.8 to 15 microns. These pixel sizes are much smaller than a pixel size of approximately 100 microns in a typical laptop computer display. The resolutions of our current commercially available display products are 320 x 240, 432 x 240, 640 x 360, 640 x 480, 854 x 480, 800 x 600, 1,280 x 720,1,280 x 1,024 and 2048 x 2048. We are also working on further decreasing the power consumption of our display products. The pixel size of our current reflective display products ranges from 8.2 to 13.6 microns. The resolutions of our current commercially available reflective display products are 1,280 x 768, 1,280 x 1,024, 2,048 x 1,536, 2048 x 2048 pixels. The pixel size of our current OLED display is 8.6 microns with a resolution of 2048 x 2048. Additional display development efforts include expanding the resolutions offered, increasing the quantity of display active matrix pixel arrays processed on each wafer by further reducing the display size, increasing the light throughput of our pixels, increasing manufacturing yields, and increasing the functionality of our HLA products.
We offer components such as our optical lenses, backlights and ASICs, manufactured to our specifications, which we then buy and resell. The components which are made to order include either intellectual property we developed or that we license from third parties.
Headset System Design Products
Our headset system efforts are primarily focused on improving the optics in the display pod and reducing the size and power consumption of the unit and improving the overall fit and style of the system.
Funded Research and Development
We have entered into various development contracts with agencies and prime contractors of the U.S. government and commercial customers. These contracts help support the continued development of our core technologies. We intend to continue to pursue development contracts for applications that relate to our commercial and military product applications. Our contracts contain certain milestones relating to technology development and may be terminated prior to completion of funding. Our policy is to retain our proprietary rights with respect to the principal commercial applications of our technology, however, we are not always able to retain our proprietary rights. To the extent technology development has been funded by a U.S. federal agency, under applicable U.S. federal laws the federal agency that provided the funding has the right to obtain a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, fully paid license to practice or have practiced this technology for governmental use. For our commercial development agreements customers often obtain exclusive rights to a particular display or technology that is developed either permanently or for some period of time. Revenues attributable to research and development contracts for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 totaled $5.3 million, $2.9 million and $1.5 million, respectively.
Competition
Component Products
The commercial display market is highly competitive and is currently dominated by large Asian-based electronics companies including AUO, BOE Technology Group, Himax, LG Display, Samsung, Sharp, Seiko and Sony. The display market consists of multiple segments, each focusing on different end-user applications applying different technologies. Competition in the display field is based on price and performance characteristics, product quality, size and the ability to deliver products in a timely fashion. The success of our display product offerings will also depend upon the adoption of our display products by consumers as an alternative to traditional active matrix LCDs or OLEDs and upon our ability to compete against other types of well-established display products and new emerging display products. Particularly significant is a consumer's willingness to use a near eye display device, as opposed to a direct view display which may be viewed from a distance of several inches to several feet. In addition, companies such as Samsung and Oculus are offering products which use a cell phone or a cell phone display to provide the image. Cell phone displays typically have lower resolution and greater image latency than our products but are lower in cost on a per square inch basis. We cannot be certain that we will be able to compete against these companies and technologies, or that the consumer will accept the use of such eyewear in general or our partners' form factor specifically.
There are also a number of active matrix LCD and alternative display technologies in development and production. These technologies include plasma, organic light emitting diode, micro light emitting diodes (“LEDs”) and virtual retinal displays, some of which target the high performance small form factor display markets in which our military and 
8

industrial display products are sold. There are many large and small companies that manufacture or have in development products based on these technologies. Our display products will compete with other displays utilizing these and other competing display technologies.
There are many companies whose sole business is the development and manufacture of optical lenses, backlights, ASICs, software and noise cancellation products. These companies may have significantly more intellectual property and experience than we do in the design and development of these components. We do not manufacture optical lenses, backlights, or ASICs but we either have them made to our specifications or buy standard off-the-shelf products.
Headset Concept Design Products
The markets our headset systems are targeted at currently use smartphones, smartwatches, laptop computers, personal computers, tablets, ruggedized portable computers referred to as "tough books” and a variety of hand-held devices. These markets are extremely competitive and is served by companies such as Panasonic, Garmin, Toshiba, Dell, HTC, Hewlett Packard, Apple, Sony and Samsung. These companies are substantially larger than Kopin from revenue, cash flow and asset perspectives.
Patents, Proprietary Rights and Licenses
An important part of our product development strategy is to seek, when appropriate, protection for our products and proprietary technology through the use of various U.S. and foreign patents and contractual arrangements. We intend to prosecute and defend our proprietary technology aggressively. Many of our U.S. patents and applications have counterpart foreign patents, foreign patent applications or international patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty.
Government Regulations
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental regulations including the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process. The failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production or cessation of operations. Any failure on our part to control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances, or otherwise comply with environmental regulations, could subject us to significant future liabilities. In addition, we cannot be certain that we or our suppliers have not in the past violated applicable laws or regulations, which violations could result in required remediation or other liabilities. We also cannot be certain that past use or disposal of environmentally sensitive materials in conformity with then existing environmental laws and regulations will protect us from required remediation or other liabilities under current or future environmental laws or regulations. Certain chemicals we import are subject to regulation by the U.S. government. If we or our suppliers do not comply with applicable laws, we could be subject to adverse government actions and may not be able to import critical supplies. 
We are also subject to federal International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR") laws which regulate the export of technical data and export of products to other nations which may use these products for military purposes. The failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, or a cessation of operations. Any failure on our part to obtain any required licenses for the export of technical data and/or export of our products or to otherwise comply with ITAR, could subject us to significant future liabilities. In addition, we cannot be certain that we have not in the past violated applicable laws or regulations, which violations could result in required remediation or other liabilities.
We are also subject to federal importation laws which regulate the importation of raw materials and equipment from other nations which are used in our products. The failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, or a cessation of operations.
Investments in Related Businesses
In March 2017, we purchased 100% of the outstanding stock of NVIS for $3.7 million. NVIS produces virtual reality systems for 3D applications. We may be required to pay up to $2.0 million if certain future operating performance milestones are met and the selling shareholders remain employed with NVIS through March 2020. As there is a requirement to remain employed to earn the contingent payments, these contingent payments will be treated as compensation expense. We consolidate NVIS’ financial results within our consolidated financial statement.
We own 100% of the outstanding common stock of Forth Dimension Displays Ltd. ("FDD") and Kopin Software Ltd. and we consolidate their financial results within our consolidated financial statements.

We own 80% of the outstanding common stock of e-MDT America ("eMDT") and we consolidate the financial results of eMDT within our consolidated financial statements.
We acquired an equity interest in a company in the first quarter of 2018 for $1.0 million and Company also contributed certain intellectual property. As of December 29, 2018, we own 12.5% interest in this investment and the carrying value of our investment is $3.9 million. 
We licensed certain intellectual property to a company and received a warrant to exercise 15% of the equity in the company's next equity offering. We exercised the warrant in the second quarter of 2018 and received 15% of the shares in the equity offering. 
We may from time to time make further equity investments in these and other companies engaged in certain aspects of the display, electronics, optical and software industries as part of our business strategy. In addition, the wearable computing product market is relatively new and there may be other technologies we need to invest in to enhance our product offering. These investments may not provide us with any financial return or other benefit and any losses by these companies or associated losses in our investments may negatively impact our operating results. 
Employees
As of December 29, 2018, our consolidated business employed 180 individuals. Of these employees, 9 hold Ph.D. degrees in Material Science, Electrical Engineering or Physics. Our management and professional employees have significant prior experience in semiconductor materials, device transistor and display processing, manufacturing and other related technologies. Our employees are located in the U.S., Europe and Asia and the laws regarding employee relationships are different by jurisdiction. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider relations with our employees to be good.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Components
We rely on third party independent contractors for certain integrated circuit chip sets and other critical raw materials such as special glasses, wafers and chemicals. In addition, our higher-level CyberDisplay assemblies, binocular display module, and other modules include lenses, backlights, printed circuit boards and other components that we purchase from third party suppliers. Some of these third party contractors and suppliers are small companies with limited financial resources. In addition, relative to the commercial market, the military buys a small number of units which prevents us from qualifying and buying components economically from multiple vendors. As a result, we are highly dependent on a select number of third party contractors and suppliers.
In addition, we also are subject to rules promulgated by the Securities Exchange Commission ("SEC") in 2012 pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 that require us to conduct due diligence on and disclose if we are able to determine whether certain materials (including tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, originate from mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or certain adjoining countries ("DRC"), are used in our products. The DRC minerals report for a calendar year is due by the second quarter of the following calendar year and we conduct appropriate ongoing diligence measures to comply with such requirements.
