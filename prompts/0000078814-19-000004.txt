Business Segments
Our business is organized around three distinct sets of solutions -- Commerce Services, Small and Medium Business Solutions (SMB Solutions), and Software Solutions. 
Commerce Services
Our Commerce Services group includes our cross-border solutions, shipping solutions, fulfillment, delivery and return services and presort services. The Commerce Services group includes our Global Ecommerce and Presort Services segments. 
Global Ecommerce 
Global Ecommerce includes our cross-border ecommerce solutions, domestic retail and ecommerce shipping solutions and fulfillment, delivery and return services. Global Ecommerce provides a full suite of domestic and cross-border solutions that help businesses of all sizes conduct commerce and participate in the parcel journey from “Anywhere to Everywhere™”. It is our technology, services and industry expertise that have made us an industry leader in global ecommerce. We offer a unified ecommerce platform of capabilities for cross-border, marketplaces and shipping that center around the consumer, from simple solutions that allow a customer to print shipping labels to full service solutions from time of order to time of delivery and return. With our proprietary technology, we are able to manage all aspects of the international shopping and shipping experience, including multi-currency pricing, payment processing, fraud management, calculation of all duty, tax and shipping costs at checkout, compliance with product restrictions, export complexities and documentation requirements for customs clearance and brokerage and global logistics services. Our cross-border ecommerce software platforms are utilized by direct merchants as well as major online marketplaces enabling millions of parcels to be shipped worldwide. Our platform also connects retailers to marketplaces around the world, opening new markets and expanding existing markets for their goods.
Our shipping management solutions enable clients to reduce transportation and logistics costs, select the best carrier based on need and cost, improve delivery times and track packages in real-time. Powered by our shipping application programming interface (API) technology, an integral part of the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud, we can provide easy access to shipping and tracking services that can be easily integrated into any web application such as online shopping carts or ecommerce sites and provide guaranteed delivery times and flexible payment options. We do not perform the physical shipping function; however, our technology allows users to select the best shipper based on need and cost. 
Presort Services
We are a workshare partner of the USPS and national outsource provider of mail sortation services that allow clients to qualify large volumes of First-Class Mail, Marketing Mail and Bound and Packet Mail (Standard Flats and Bound Printed Matter) for postal worksharing discounts. We process over 16 billion pieces of mail annually through our network of operating centers throughout the United States. Our Presort Services network and fully-customized proprietary technology provides clients with end-to-end solutions from pick up at their location to delivery into the postal system network, expedited mail delivery and optimal postage savings. 
Small and Medium Business Solutions
We are a global leader in providing a full range of equipment, technology, supplies and services that enable our clients to efficiently create mail, evidence postage and help simplify and save on the sending, tracking and receiving of mail, flats and parcels. We are a leading global provider of sending systems and technology. Our cloud enabled infrastructure provides software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings delivered online and via connected or mobile devices. Our latest offerings are designed on an open platform architecture that leverages partnerships with other innovative companies as well as an ecosystem of developers to deliver new value to our clients. Within the SMB Solutions group is the North America Mailing segment, comprised of the sending operations in the U.S. and Canada, and the International Mailing segment, comprised of all other sending businesses globally.

We will begin offering expanded third-party leasing solutions to our existing SMB client base in the United States in 2019. Under this program, in addition to leasing options for our mailing equipment products, we will offer leasing alternatives for our existing SMB client base to lease other manufacturers' equipment to meet their business needs. 
Software Solutions
Within Software Solutions, we offer data, customer information management, location intelligence and customer engagement solutions. These solutions are delivered as on-premise licenses or on-demand/SaaS applications.
Data solutions enable businesses to identify addresses, locations, businesses and individuals. Our address-centric approach provides us the ability to verify, standardize, locate and enrich both physical and digital addresses with actionable insights. The quality and accuracy of data is foundational to many business processes, including the identification and mitigation of risk and fraud, the onboarding of and marketing to customers and potential customers, and helping organizations better serve their customers.
Customer information management solutions help businesses identify high-value customers and prospects, develop a deep and broad understanding of their customers and provide a single view of the customer in context to their location, relationships and influence. By understanding who their customers are, and what they do, businesses can in turn understand preferences and purchasing behaviors, detect fraudulent activity and increase marketing effectiveness and services. We are one of the market leaders in the data quality segment. Large corporations and government agencies rely on our products in complex, high-volume, transactional environments to support their business processes.
Location intelligence solutions enable businesses to understand the complex relationships between location, geographic and other forms of data to drive business decisions and customer experiences. Our location intelligence solutions use predictive analytics and location, geographic and socio-demographic data to add context and insight, making it possible to pinpoint the best placement for retail sites, improve risk assessment and efficiently deploy infrastructure resources to better serve their customers, solve business problems, deliver location-based services and drive business growth.
Customer engagement solutions enable businesses to communicate with their customers in more personalized and relevant ways that enhance customer interactions across the entire customer lifecycle. Through personalized, impactful and timely physical and digital interactions, businesses can improve customer satisfaction, reduce support costs and drive sales. Our customer engagement solutions enable businesses to create connected experiences that positively influence future consumer behavior and generate business growth.
Seasonality
As our business continues to transform and shipping becomes a bigger part of our financial performance, a larger percentage of our revenue and earnings will be earned in the fourth quarter relative to the other quarters, driven primarily by the impact of the holiday season on Commerce Services. 
Client Service
We provide call-center, online and on-site support services for our products and solutions. Most of our support services are provided under maintenance contracts.
Sales and Marketing
We market our products, solutions and services through a direct and inside sales force, global and regional partner channels, direct mailings and web-based offerings. 
Competition
All of our businesses face competition from a number of companies. Our competitors range from large, multinational companies that compete against many of our businesses to smaller, more narrowly focused regional and local firms. We compete on the basis of technology and innovation; breadth of product offerings; our ability to design and tailor solutions to specific client needs; performance; client service and support; price; quality and brand.
We must continue to invest in our current technologies, products and solutions, and in the development of new technologies, products and solutions in order to maintain and improve our competitive position. We will encounter new competitors as we transition to higher value markets and offerings and enter new markets.

A summary of the competitive environment for each of our business segments is as follows:
Global Ecommerce
The market for international ecommerce software and fulfillment services is highly fragmented and includes competitors of various sizes, including companies with greater financial resources than us. Some of these competitors specialize in point solutions or freight forwarding services, are full-service ecommerce business process outsourcers and online marketplaces with international logistic support, or major global delivery services companies. We also see a competitive threat from companies who can offer both domestic and cross-border solutions in a single package which creates leverage for those competitors on pricing. The principal competitive factors include reliability, functionality, ease of integration and use, scalability, innovation, support services and price. We compete based on the accuracy, reliability and scalability of our platform and logistics services, our ability to provide clients and their customers a one-stop full-service ecommerce experience and the ability to provide a more customized shipping solution to smaller businesses than some of our larger competitors in the industry. We also compete, within shipping solutions, with a wide range of technology providers who help make shipping easier and more cost-effective. There are established players in the marketplace as well as many small companies offering negotiated carrier rates (primarily with the USPS). The principal competitive factors include technology stability and reliability, innovation, access to preferred shipping rates and ease of integration with existing systems. 
Presort Services
We face competition from regional and local presort providers, cooperatives of multiple local presort providers, consolidators and service bureaus that offer presort solutions as part of a larger bundle of outsourcing services. While not necessarily competitors in the traditional sense, large mail owners have the capability to presort their own mailings in-house. The principal competitive factors include innovative service, delivery speed, tracking and reporting, industry expertise and economies of scale. Our competitive advantages include our extensive network of presort facilities capable of processing significant volumes and our innovative and proprietary technology that enables us to provide our clients with reliable, secure and precise services offering maximum postage discounts. 
North America Mailing and International Mailing
We face significant competition from other mail equipment and software providers, companies that offer products and services as alternative means of message communications and those that offer shipping and mailing products and services through on-line solutions. Additionally, as competitive alternative communication methods in comparison to mail grow, our SMB Solutions operations could be affected. We differentiate ourselves in many areas including: software and hardware solutions; pricing; available financing and payment offerings; product reliability; support services; industry knowledge and expertise and attractiveness of alternative communication methods. Our competitive advantage includes our breadth of physical and web-based digital offerings, customer service and our extensive knowledge of the shipping and mailing industry. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, The Pitney Bowes Bank (the Bank), we offer a revolving credit solution to our clients in the United States that enables them to pay the rental fee for certain mailing equipment and to purchase postage, services and supplies. The Bank also provides an interest-bearing deposit solution to those clients who prefer to prepay postage. We also provide similar revolving credit solutions to our clients in Canada and the U.K., but not through the Bank. Our financing operations face competition, in varying degrees, from large, diversified financial institutions, including leasing companies, commercial finance companies and commercial banks, as well as small, specialized firms. Not all our competitors are able to offer these financing and payment solutions to their customers and we believe these solutions differentiate us from our competitors and are a source of competitive advantage. The Bank is chartered as an Industrial Bank under the laws of the State of Utah, and is regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions.
Software Solutions 
We operate in several highly competitive and rapidly evolving markets and face competition ranging from large global companies that offer a broad suite of solutions to smaller, more narrowly-focused companies that can design very targeted solutions. The principal competitive factors include reliability, functionality, ease of integration and use, scalability, innovation, support and price. We compete based on the accuracy, breadth, scalability and processing speed of our products and solutions, our geocoding and reverse geocoding capabilities, our expertise in address validation, and our ability to identify rapidly changing customer needs and develop technologies and solutions to meet these changing needs. 
Financing Solutions
We offer a variety of solutions that enable clients to finance equipment and product purchases, make rental and lease payments, replenish postage and purchase supplies. As product and service offerings evolve, we continually evaluate whether there are appropriate financing solutions to offer our clients. We establish credit approval limits and procedures based on the credit quality of the client and the type of product or service provided to control risk in extending credit to clients. In addition, we utilize a systematic decision program for certain leases. This program is designed to facilitate low dollar transactions by utilizing historical payment patterns and behaviors of clients with

similar credit characteristics. This program defines criteria under which we will accept a client without performing a more detailed credit investigation, such as maximum equipment cost, a client's time in business and payment experience. 
We closely monitor the portfolio by analyzing industry sectors and delinquency trends by product line, industry and client to ensure reserve levels and credit policies reflect current trends. Management continues to closely monitor credit lines and collection resources and revise credit policies as necessary to be more selective in managing the portfolio.
In 2019, we will begin offering expanded third-party leasing solutions to our existing SMB client base in the United States. Under this program, we will offer leasing alternatives for our existing SMB client base to lease other manufacturers' equipment to meet their business needs. By offering this program to our existing SMB clients, we will be able to leverage our extensive credit review and history of these clients to establish credit limits and control risk. 
Research, Development and Intellectual Property
We invest in research and development activities to develop new products and solutions, enhance the effectiveness and functionality of existing products and solutions and deliver high value technology, innovative software and differentiated services in high value segments of the market. As a result of our historical research and development efforts, we have been awarded a number of patents with respect to several of our innovations and products. However, as we transition our business to more software and service-based offerings and patent laws make it more difficult to obtain patent protection, we now rely more on trade secrets and confidentiality. Our businesses are not materially dependent on any one patent or license or group of related patents or licenses. 
Third-party Suppliers
We depend on third-party suppliers for a variety of services and product components and other vendors to enable our product and shipping solutions. In certain instances, we rely on single-sourced or limited-sourced suppliers and vendors around the world because the relationship is advantageous due to quality, price, or there are no alternative sources. We believe that our available sources for services, components, supplies and manufacturing are adequate. 
Regulatory Matters 
We are subject to the regulations of postal authorities worldwide related to product specifications of our postage meters. Our Presort Services business practices are also subject to regulations of the USPS. The operations of the Bank and certain company affiliates that provide services to the Bank are subject to the regulations of the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC. We are also subject to transportation, customs and trade regulations worldwide related to our cross-border shipping services and regulations concerning data privacy and security for our businesses that use, process and store certain personal, confidential or proprietary data. 
Employees and Employee Relations 
At December 31, 2018, we have approximately 13,300 employees worldwide. We believe that we maintain strong relationships with our employees. Management keeps employees informed of decisions and encourages and implements employee suggestions whenever practicable.
