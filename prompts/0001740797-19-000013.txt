General

FreeCook is a newly-developed web platform that aims to connect food lovers with culinary craftsmen of their communities. We create a network between people who cook at home and are willing to sell their meals online and those looking for homemade delicacies. We aim not to let the passion of artisan chefs stay undiscovered by the rest of the world, encourage home cooks to keep developing their talents, by attracting clients to our marketplace. Anyone can shop online with FreeCook where new meals, cuisines and dish presentations are daily offered by artisan cooks and will win any gourmets heart. We are building and developing the web platform with functions to inform, provide contacts and the list of meals offered by and to our online users.

Our principal office address is located at Vilniaus g.31, Vilnius, LT-01402, Lithuania. The phone number of the Company is +370.5251.2561 available Monday to Friday from 10:00am to 5:00pm EET (Lithuanian time). The direct phone line of Natalija Tunevic is +15404950016. Our plan of operation is forward-looking, however, there is no assurance that we will ever reach profitable operations.

Our Business

Our company aims at businesses operating in instantly growing and changing market of food delivery. By developing our website, FreeCook has a goal to help culinary amateurs as well as professional chefs impress neighbors with their fantasy, creativity and true passion for cooking. Being a hopeless foodaholic, the developer lets like-minded people discover new original recipes prepared next door as well as get an unforgettable experience for all their senses. We plan to build and develop the web platform with functions to inform the users and provide contacts and the list of meals delivered by the registered home-cooks. All meals are listed on the menu from a wide variety of chefs, that are to be identified by their location (city) and online/offline status. The meals are split into categories depending on the type of product it is, in order to make customers search as smooth as it can possibly be. Our website visitors are expected to navigate through the platform by search inquiries or by browsing the full list of offered meals, depending on their choice, as well as they may switch between browsing a certain category, such as type of product or the location of the chef and sorting the dishes by popularity/price. Once a visitor chooses a meal, they may move back to menu section by clicking the initial menu button, or see other recipes of the chef, read other customers reviews regarding the chef and his/her meals, send the chef a message, add to favorites etc. The meals can be delivered personally by the cook to the client or shipped across the country of Lithuania by courier delivery services. Initially, the website is absolutely free but over the time the brand recognition increases, the companys revenue is to be generated by users' sales, we expect to charge 5% off each sale made through our web site. Payment methods acceptable for sales made through the platform are MasterCard, Visa, PayPal and Cash (clients personally to chefs).

We are planning to release the web-platform in Lithuania and, in perspective, attract other European countries to use our platform.

We plan to conduct different sorts of promotional campaigns to demonstrate versatility of customers included in our database. We have already started to work on upgrading our web platform and the codes, web-design and software.

Marketing

We are likely to choose online marketing as our key strategy to promote and attract the customers, hence we are about to represent an online business entity, which works for the company offering a possibility of online order. At the initial stage of development, we are likely first to invest into advertising via Google AdWords and optimize Google Search Engine. It helps us to appear in customers search inquiries on the Internet. Thus, we expect to get into the attention of both our potential customers and their clients. (to whom we might refer as platform users or users). Alongside, we plan to represent our business on the variety of popular social networks pages, where we plan to provide with detailed information both our potential customers and the potential web platform users. We also plan to use direct calls and mailing with our business proposals, providing references to our platform and social web pages. We might also consider other sites related to food consuming, such as sites of recipes and food retailers, for instance. With more advanced investment we might shoot promotional videos related to cooking, for advertising purposes. As the business grows, we might set up TV channel built-in the web platform itself, where chefs will demonstrate their skills teaching how to cook different meals available for order on the platform. To attract potential customers, we plan to elaborate a program of free promotional periods, or promotional period devoted to a particular cuisine or other promo-campaigns.

Target market

We primarily plan to target the market of home cooks aged between 50 and 60 years old and clients of 25 to 35 years old who would be interested in buying homemade food online. We target cooks of the above-mentioned age because these are the people to have achieved their professional goals and at this stage have the time, experience and willingness to cook at home and get some extra money to their pockets. The age of their customers is expected to vary between 25 and 35 years old for the reason that by this age people tend to realize the advantages of home food over fast food, however, are busy with their jobs and do not have the time or energy for cooking after work.

Competition and Industry overview

The Food Delivery industry of Lithuania accounted over $47,000,000 in the year of 2018 and is expected to continue growing by 21.6% during the next four years, thus, bringing a promising opportunity for online restaurants and home cooks selling their meals online to accumulate great revenues. In addition, data indicates that the vast majority of the revenue gathered in the year of 2018 was Take Away services, meaning people currently are willing to pick up their meals by themselves rather than wait for couriers, and the segment is expected to grow significantly by 2022.

We expect to face strong competition from the online restaurants industry that nowadays is very well-developed and popular. The most competitive service providers are ChiefPizza, Meniu.lt and Rekvizitai.lt. Though these companies are well-known, none of them offers homemade original food with a great diversity of choices at very competitive prices. These points are positioned to be our strengths and opportunities.

Revenue

Currently we see the following sources of our income:
 - The companys revenue is to be generated by users' sales. We plan to change 5% off every sale made through our platform.
 - From selling the advertising slots on the pages of our web platform.
