ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
Cavitation Technologies, Inc. (referred to herein, unless otherwise indicated, as “the Company,” “CTi,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) is a Nevada corporation originally incorporated under the name Bio Energy, Inc. We are a process and product development firm that has developed, patented, and commercialized environmentally friendly technology-based systems that are designed to serve large, growing, global markets such as vegetable oil refining, renewable fuels, water treatment, wines and spirits enhancement, algae oil extraction, water-oil emulsions and crude oil yield improvement.  Our systems are designed to process industrial liquids at a reduced processing time, lower operating cost, improved yield while operating in environmentally friendly manner. We have developed, patented, and commercialized our proprietary technology that can be used in multiple liquid processing applications. Our patented Nano Reactor® is the critical component of our CTi Nano Neutralization® System which has been shown to reduce operating costs and increase yields in refining vegetable oils.
 
Vegetable Oil Refining 
 
Our first commercial application for our technology has been the CTi Nano Neutralization® System which has been utilized to improve edible vegetable oil refining process. Our environmentally friendly process has been shown to reduce refining costs, increase oil yield, and limit the amount of chemical additives used in chemical refining of vegetables oils. This patented process (US Patent # 7,762,715 and # 8,042,989) is designed to be incorporated into new and existing soybean, rapeseed, canola and palm vegetable oil refineries.
 
Our first pilot test of our CTi NANO Neutralization System was conducted in 2010 at Carolina Soya, a 200-metric ton/day crude soy oil refining plant in Estill, South Carolina. Our second system, which became operational in fiscal 2011, has been continuously utilized since 2011 at the plant that processes approximately 450 metric tons per day of soy oil. Further, we have successfully shipped over 30 systems both domestically and abroad. We also continuously focus on developing additional Nano Reactor® applications and managing the intellectual property issues associated with new processes and applications.
 
The global consumption of vegetable oils has grown consistently at a rate of about 5.3% p.a. from 90.5 million metric tons in 2001 to over 203 million metric tons in 2019 (https://www.statista.com/statistics/263978/global-vegetable-oil-production-since2000-2001/). It is also a highly competitive commodity market in which the lowest-cost producer has the advantage.
 
Desmet Ballestra Agreement 
 
On May 14, 2012 we signed a global R and D, Marketing and Technology License Agreement with Desmet Ballestra Group s.a. (Desmet), a Belgian company that is actively marketing the NANO Neutralization System, the key component of which is our Nano Reactor® to soybean and other vegetable oil refiners. The Agreement provided Desmet (licensee) a limited, exclusive license and right to develop, design and supply our NANO Neutralization System which incorporates Nano Reactor® devices on a global basis tools and fats and oleo chemical applications Desmet provided, under certain conditions, limited monthly advance payments of $125,000 against future sales to us through May 2015. This Agreement expired in May 2015.

On January 22, 2016, we signed a similar three-year agreement with Desmet effective August 1, 2015. As part of the agreement, Desmet was to provide, under certain conditions, limited monthly advance payments of $50,000 against future sales to us. The agreement expires in August 2018 or may be terminated by Desmet every August 1 should Desmet and its affiliates fail to convert a minimum of six NANO Neutralization Systems to sold status during the period of June 1 to May 31. The agreement may also be terminated in case we were to lose our rights under the patents and patent applications being used in our CTi NANO Neutralization System. This Agreement expired in August 2018.
 
On October 1, 2018, Desmet and the Company executed a new three year License Agreement with essentially the same terms with the January 2016 agreement. As part of the agreement, Desmet agreed to provide us monthly advances of $50,000 through October 1, 2022 to be applied against gross profit share from future sales.
 
Desmet, together with its affiliates, is a global engineering and equipment supply firm engaged in the development, design and supply of process equipment for oils and fats processing facilities including vegetable oil refining, biofuel, oleo chemical, seed crushing, surfactant and detergent markets. Desmet supplies these markets with services based on the latest globally sourced technologies. Desmet has relationships with major refiners globally A significant portion of global vegetable oil refineries include major refiners such as Archer Daniels Midland Company, Cargill, Inc. and Bunge Limited. Desmet has more than 40 sales representatives selling in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Since its founding in 1946, Desmet reports that it has built a global network that includes 1,300 employees, 17 global and 8 representative offices, and more than 6,000 lines in a variety of applications. Desmet operates a separate division for each of the above markets and the Desmet Oils & Fats division has supplied small and large plants to approximately 1,900 oil millers in 150 countries, covering over 6300 process sections.
 
Along with Desmet, we have been working together to accelerate appropriate sales goals and installation process. Our CTi Nano Neutralization System is designed to be used as an add-on process to an existing neutralization system within soybean and other vegetable oil refineries. Desmet’s focus has been on marketing our CTi’s Nano Neutralization® System to vegetable oil refiners to help them increase profits through cost savings and improved oil yields. Desmet purchases our CTi Nano Neutralization Reactor Systems from us and installs them at the refinery as part of an integrated neutralization system. Based on successful commercial implementations, Desmet guarantees minimum economic benefits to a facility that installs our CTi Nano Neutralization® Systems. We are therefore substantially dependent on Desmet to identify prospects, complete sales contracts, install the system and manage relationships with end-users.
 
Additionally, in fiscal 2017 Desmet installed our first Nano Reactors® at bio-diesel production plant in South America. Bio-diesel industry has been under pricing pressure for a considerable period of time and slow to adopt to newer technologies. We are continuously working with Desmet pursuing additional installations, however, the acceptance was slow and there were no sales generated in our Fiscal 2019.
 
GEA Westfalia Agreement
 
In August 2012, we entered into a Technology and Licensing Agreement with the GEA Group AG - Westfalia Separator Group (“GEA”) pursuant to which the companies agreed to jointly develop and patent new applications of our core technologies. As part of the Agreement, GEA Westfalia was to assemble a complete commercial test system comprising Nano Reactors®. This Agreement was terminated in January 2017.

In January 2017 we entered into a new global technology license, R&D and marketing agreement with GEA with respect to our patented Nano Reactors® technology, processes and applications. Under the new agreement, GEA has been granted a worldwide exclusive license to integrate our patented technology into water treatment application, milk and juice pasteurization, and certain food related processes. The license agreement between us and GEA has a three-year term and provides for the payment of $300,000 per year in advanced license fees to us. As of June 30, 2019, the Company has received $727,000 in advances from GEA under this agreement. 
 
GEA Westfalia Separator manufactures filtration and equipment such as separators, clarifiers, decanters and membrane filtration systems. This equipment is used for the purification of suspensions, the separation of fluid mixtures with simultaneous removal of solids, extraction and concentration or removal of liquids from solids. The technological dominance of the company is based on over one hundred fifteen years of innovation, first-class engineering solutions and comprehensive processing capabilities. The company was founded in 1893 in Oelde, Germany, and since 1994 has been a part of the GEA Group AG and is a business unit within the GEA Mechanical Equipment segment. In 1950, Westfalia Separator established US and Canadian corporations to serve as sales and marketing arms to compete in the burgeoning North American market for centrifuges. GEA is one of the largest suppliers for the food processing industry and a wide range of process industries that has reported consolidated revenues of approximately EUR 4.9 billion in 2018. As an international technology group, GEA focuses on process technology and components for sophisticated production processes in various end-user markets. The GEA Group AG generates more than 70 percent of its revenue in the food sector that enjoys long-term sustainable growth. As of December 31, 2018, GEA Group AG employed more than 18,000 people worldwide. GEA is a market and technology leader in its business areas. GEA is listed on the German MDAX (G1A, WKN 660 200). In addition, GEA’s share is a constituent of the MSCI Global Sustainability Indexes.
 
In our Fiscal 2019, we haven’t generated any sales related to our Nano Reactors® Systems, however, we are actively working on testing our technology in renewable energy sector. For example, the process of creating a stable emulsion by mixing water and hydrocarbons, or water and vegetable oil as an energy source for diesel engines or power generators has been pursued by a number of companies in the past with limited success. Our tests and laboratory analysis have indicated that by restructuring fluids at the molecular level, our technology achieves stable emulsion for certain periods of time thus allowing the end user to infuse the emulsion as a source of power generation. We anticipate to achieve similar results while conducting commercial system trials in fiscal 2019-2020.
 
Alchemy Beverages, Inc
 
In fiscal 2014, Roman Gordon, one of our shareholders and a former officer, formed a company, Cameo USA LLC (Cameo). Since its formation, Cameo has had no revenue, no operations, and has had no assets or liabilities. On June 4, 2018, Mr. Gordon contributed his 100% interest in Cameo to our company. As Mr. Gordon had no basis in his investment in Cameo, there was no value assigned to the contribution of Cameo.
 
On June 29, 2018, we agreed to sell Cameo to Alchemy Beverages Inc. (“ABI”). In addition, we entered into two licensing agreements with ABI. In consideration for the sale of Cameo and for entering into the licensing agreements, ABI agreed to issue 19.9% of ABI’s outstanding common shares to us (limited to 20 million shares of ABI). ABI is a private company and in the business of producing and selling alcoholic beverages, equipment, and home appliances. Prior to this agreement, ABI was independent of CTI and had no relation to us nor to our management. ABI purchased Cameo for the right to use its name in marketing a vodka spirit.

Pursuant to the licensing agreements, ABI will have the exclusive global distribution rights for our patented and patent pending technology for the processing of alcoholic beverages. We have agreed to assist in the installation and maintenance of the nano reactor systems for ABI and will receive royalty payments ranging from 1% to 3% on all net revenues, as defined, of ABI for the life of the applicable patents. In addition, we will receive leasing, consulting, and manufacturing fees as defined in the licensing agreement.
 
To date, ABI hasn’t generated any sales under Cameo brand. Over the last 12 months, ABI has developed a small table top home appliance unit Barmuze®, allowing consumer to experience a new way of enjoying wines and spirits, utilizing CTi’s patented and patent pending technology to molecularly restructure alcohol, convert harsh acids to pleasant tasting esters, and reduce levels of certain impurities commonly present in alcohol. We have miniaturized our Nano Reactor® to be incorporated in Barmuze® along with proprietary designs and mechanical components.
 
We anticipate to start recognizing revenue on Barmuze® sales and receive royalties from the ABI transaction in our fiscal 2020. As of June 30, 2019 and the date of this report, the Company owns 19.9% of ABI. The investment in ABI has no value assigned to it, which approximates its fair value.
 
Enviro Watertek, LLC
 
In April 2019, we have entered into a licensing and service contract agreement with Enviro Watertek, LLC (“EW”). This agreement covers our first commercial entrance into industrial treatment of produced and frac water. Fracking industry has seen a significant growth over the past ten years, reaching daily water consumption volume of over 58 million barrels per day. Our newly designed Low Pressure Nano Reactor (LPN) , was specifically developed to be integrated into frac water treatment system along with proprietary chemical formulations, and has depicted measurable and quantifiable advantages over industry standard processes and equipment. Our agreement with EW provides for sales on Nano Reactors® plus recurring revenue stream based on processing frack water volumes and utilization. Our agreement with EW is for a period of 15 years . We sold our first Nano Reactor® system in the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2019 and expect accelerated acceptance of our technology and revenue stream in our fiscal 2020 and beyond.
Customers Dependence
 
We continue to sell our industrial capacity Nano Reactor® and Nano Reactor® Systems and technology only to two licensees, Desmet and GEA, and they are responsible for installing and servicing the systems. Almost all of our revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was derived from sales of products to Desmet. However, our recently signed agreements with ABI and EW have opened an opportunity for CTi to enter several new verticals which have significant upside potential both at the point of sale and recurring revenue stream.
 
Sources and availability of raw materials and the names of principal suppliers
 
We have historically sourced reactor components from various domestic and international suppliers. We do not have any long-term contracts, agreements, or commitments with any supplier. We believe it would take approximately 30 days to find a new supplier, if necessary.

Competition
 
Our competitors who sell equipment and engineering services for the vegetable oil refining business are a myriad of companies both large and small that provide equipment and technology to oil refiners. These include known companies that have longer operating histories, more experience, and stronger financial capabilities. Competitors include Alfa Laval, and Crown Iron Works as well as many firms that provide advice and services to small and regional firms. In addition, Arisdyne Systems, a designer of cavitation devices, is marketing a system using similar technology. The vegetable oil refining business is a highly competitive commodity market in which the lowest-cost producer has the advantage. We intend to compete by offering solutions that help our clients remain or become a low-cost producer. Because the industry in which we compete has had limited new technology introduced in the last 50 years, we believe our CTi Nano Neutralization® Systems provide a unique opportunity for refiners to increase margins. We seek to differentiate ourselves by offering solutions based on our proprietary and patented designs, processes, and applications to help our clients described in our issued and patent pending applications. We compete by offering solutions that we believe can reduce operating expenses and increase oil yield vs currently applied technologies.
Patents
 
Our Cavitation Generator patent was issued during fiscal 2011. In addition, we have a patent for our Multi-Stage Cavitation Device that was issued on October 25, 2011. In the fiscal 2014 we received approvals for another apparatus patent and 2 additional process patents in the US. At June 30, 2019, our portfolio of patents included 17 issued patents in the United States and 8 issued patents internationally. Our patents cover multiple process and applications of our technology in vegetable oil refining, production of biodiesel, treatment of process and industrial water, upgrade of hydrocarbons and enhancing of alcoholic beverages. We continuously develop new technologies and applications, as we have filed a new patent application for Low Pressure Nano-Reactors, (LPN). LPN is a highly efficient homogenizer and emulsifier that can be utilized in multiple fluids processing applications. Recently, we have filed a patent application for a small home appliance. This new product is designed directly with consumer in mind and the first step for our company to introduce products outside of the industrial sector where we typically sell our products.
