Item 1.Business.
Overview
We are a pre-revenue stage biopharmaceutical company. Until May 2022 we were focused on the clinical development of Ampion® and preclinical development of AR-300, a novel, proprietary, small molecule formulation that has (i) demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and (ii) protection of cartilage in preclinical rat meniscal tear studies. 
Subsequently, we have shifted nearly all of our focus towards the preclinical development of AR-300 and we are currently conducting studies to evaluate the efficacy of AR-300 in osteoarthritis-related pain. If the preclinical data is compelling, we would plan to initially target clinical development of AR-300 for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee (OAK). Osteoarthritis is widely regarded as being typified by cartilage loss. Substances that protect articular cartilage during the course of osteoarthritis have been termed chondroprotective. Clinical demonstration of cartilage protection and pain management in the knee could position AR-300 for administration early in the current OAK treatment paradigm which we believe is a potentially large and attractive market opportunity.
The development of AR-300 to date has been based, in part, on our extensive drug discovery and clinical development experience obtained during the development of Ampion for the treatment of OAK. It is important to note, however, that AR-300 is not Ampion, rather it is a novel and unique formulation in preclinical development. We currently expect to have preclinical pain and chondroprotection results for AR-300 in the first half of 2023.
In addition, and given the overall risks associated with preclinical drug development, we continue to opportunistically identify and evaluate strategic opportunities that would allow us to acquire or license later stage assets and/or merge with companies that have those assets as part of the strategic alternatives process that we announced in May 2022. In 2022, we evaluated more than a dozen potential strategic alternatives with the assistance of our legal, clinical and regulatory, and financial advisors consistent with our strategic alternatives process.
On November 9, 2022, the Company effected a 15-to-1 reverse stock split. The Company has retroactively applied the reverse stock split made effective on November 9, 2022 to share and per share amounts in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Additionally, pursuant to their terms, a proportionate adjustment was made to the per share exercise price and number of shares issuable under all of the Company’s outstanding options and warrants, and the number of shares authorized for issuance pursuant to the Company’s equity incentive plans have been reduced proportionately, with any fractional shares rounded up to the next whole share. The Company also retroactively applied such adjustments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The reverse stock split did not reduce the number of authorized shares of common stock and preferred stock and did not alter the par value.

Government Regulation
FDA Approval Process
If Ampio determines that pain and chondroprotection data from the AR-300 preclinical studies justify moving forward with the clinical development of AR-300, it is our intent to approach FDA in INTERACT (Initial Targeted Engagement for Regulatory Advice) and pre-IND meeting later in 2023 to discuss the development plan for the drug, which we believe will be regulated as a small molecule formulation, and will require additional, IND-enabling preclinical studies, a Phase 1 safety study, at least one Phase 2 proof of efficacy study, and likely two randomized, controlled Phase 3 studies. Based on current input from our clinical and regulatory advisor, we believe this regulatory process could comprise five-to-seven years and require an incremental investment over and above Ampio’s general operating expense during that period.Intellectual Property Summary
We will be able to protect our proprietary intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that such rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how through confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and other controls over confidential information. If we do not adequately protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, our competitive position and business prospects could be materially harmed.
The following describes our patents and patent applications relating to AR-300 and Ampion®.
AR-300
​
We own a number of United States provisional patent applications covering AR-300, as well as its uses, formulations, and manufacturing processes. We expect that these provisional patent applications, which are the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole, will be consolidated and filed as a single PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty) application in the second quarter of 2023. One or more national phase applications will be filed from this PCT application approximately eighteen (18) months later, in the third quarter of 2024.
​
Because we are currently focused on the preclinical development of AR-300, we anticipate filing additional patent applications in the future, covering new discoveries, formulations and/or research advancements in or relating to AR-300, as we determine appropriate.
​
Patents covering AR-300 may extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Generally speaking, patents to issue from the above-mentioned PCT application will exist for a period of twenty years from the filing date of the PCT application, or until the second quarter of 2043. The scope of protection afforded by a patent can also vary from country to country and depends on the patent type, the scope of its patent claims and the availability of legal remedies. Patent term extensions (PTE) may be available in some countries to compensate for a loss of patent term due to delay in a product’s approval due to the regulatory requirements.
​
Reliable patent protection and enforcement around the world are among the key factors we consider for continued business and R&D investment. The WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (WTO-TRIPS) requires participant countries to provide patent and other intellectual property-related protection for pharmaceutical products by law, with an exemption provided for least developed countries until 2033. While some countries have made improvements, we may face patent grant, enforcement and other intellectual property challenges in many countries.
​
Ampion
​
Globally, we own a large number of issued patents and pending patent applications covering Ampion®, our proprietary biological pharmaceutical product, as well as its uses, formulations, and manufacturing processes. Given the decision to focus available resources on the research and development of AR-300, we made the decision starting in 2023 to significantly limit or discontinue much of the existing patent portfolio covering Ampion®. Those members of the existing Ampion® patent estate that we expect to continue to maintain will be based on the relative importance of technologies

covered by patents, the geographic jurisdiction of patents, and remaining patent term. We believe that this strategy will significantly reduce the overall number of patents and minimize the economic impact of the Ampion® patent estate on the Company.

Human Capital Resources
As we move forward with the development of AR-300, we believe it is crucial that we have just-in-time access to specific best-in-class expertise at each unique stage of the drug’s development, including the following: (i) expertise in planning, executing, and evaluating preclinical development, (ii) planning and executing the Phase 1 safety study, (iii) planning and executing the Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, (iv) interfacing with regulatory authorities, and (v) maintaining, analyzing, and presenting data required to support regulatory filings and decisions. In addition, we continue to be a public-reporting company and, as such, require the resources to comply with our public reporting and stock exchange obligations.
Accordingly, we have implemented a hybrid organizational model whereby we retain the organizational competencies to govern and comply with the public reporting requirements and select and manage specific third-party independent contractors with proven industry expertise in formulation development, preclinical development, GMP manufacturing, clinical development, regulatory and legal on an as needed basis. We believe this model will position us best to develop AR-300 in the most expeditious and cost-effective manner, and effectively control the fixed costs associated with building an all-employee organization.
We began implementing this model toward the end of 2022 and have continued implementation into the first quarter of 2023. As of December 31, 2022, we had eight full-time employees focused on research, manufacturing, project management, accounting and finance, administrative support, information technology (“IT”), and corporate governance. As of February 1, 2023, we had five employees focused on project management, accounting and finance, IT, and corporate governance. Consistent with our outsourcing philosophy, we have contracted with third-party firms to provide medical/clinical oversight, financial and accounting control, assistance with transferring manufacturing methods, and administrative support, and have engaged third-party firms with specific orthopedic expertise to assist with designing and implementing preclinical, clinical and regulatory development plans for AR-300.
