• | Improve learners’ academic and professional success


• | Keep geographically-dispersed audiences and mobile teams connected


• | Boost productivity and overall organizational knowledge


• | Reduce logistical and financial impacts of day-to-day communications

Sonic Foundry Solutions
Sonic Foundry transforms the way organizations share and use information with these video solutions:

Sonic Foundry Solutions in Higher Education:
Among post-secondary institutions, Mediasite is used for all academic and campus environments, including:

• | Lecture capture


• | Flipped classroom instruction: students view lectures from home and use classroom time for discussion


• | Blended, hybrid and distance learning


• | Continuing education


• | Campus YouTube


• | Special events: commencement, guest speakers, sporting events, etc.


• | Faculty training and development


• | Student video projects


• | Recruitment and admissions


• | University business: leadership meetings, alumni relations, outreach

Higher education institutions consistently report that Mediasite:

• | Improves student learning outcomes


• | Keeps their institution competitive by supporting higher enrollment and/or tuition without new classrooms


• | Empowers faculty with technology supporting new teaching pedagogies both in the classroom and online


• | Boosts campus outreach, recruitment efforts and awareness of campus events


• | Helps campuses manage, secure and search all campus video

To remain relevant, colleges and universities are striving to differentiate themselves through technical leadership to attract tech-savvy students, while balancing their campus technology improvements with systems that faculty will embrace and adopt. As a result, the education market is restructuring and increasing investments around online learning.
Historically, graduate programs and STEM (science, technology, engineering and math)-oriented degree programs in schools of medicine, nursing, engineering or business have comprised most of our academic customer base. We are now experiencing heightened market demand for academic video within undergraduate and community college programs as well.
The visible integration of video-based learning into core university applications like learning management systems (LMSes) and the success of bundled online learning technology solutions are two healthy indicators for the widespread adoption of campus video. LMSes like Canvas, Brightspace™, Blackboard®, Moodle and Sakai are ubiquitous in education. As the foundation for e-learning, these systems are rapidly evolving to be students’ single-source portal for all course-related materials including recorded lecture and assignment videos. Mediasite’s packaged LMS integrations address the need to make learning content accessible to students when and where they need it. Similarly, video management platforms are emerging as repositories for campus’ media-centric content. These platforms provide additional opportunities through which to make Mediasite content accessible to faculty, staff and students.

Segment Information
8

Sonic Foundry, Inc.
Annual Report on Form 10-K
For the Year Ended September 30, 2019

We have determined that in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 280-10, Segment Reporting, we operate in three operating segments, however these segments meet the criteria for aggregation for reporting purposes as one reporting segment as of September 30, 2019. 
Billings and Distribution
Our services are typically billed and collected in advance of providing the service. Billings, which are a non-GAAP measure, are a better indicator of customer activity and cash flow than revenue is, in management’s opinion, and is therefore used by management as a key operational indicator. Billings are computed by combining revenue with the change in unearned revenue.
Our largest individual customers are typically value added resellers (“VARs”) and prior to mid fiscal 2019, distributors, since the majority of our end users require additional complementary products and services which we do not provide. In January 2019 we began reducing our reliance on domestic distributors by shipping direct to VARs when possible. Accordingly, in fiscal 2019 and 2018 one master distributor, Synnex Corporation (“Synnex”), contributed less than 1% and 6%, respectively, of total world-wide billings. A second master distributor, Starin Marketing, Inc. (“Starin”), contributed less than 1% and 11% of total world-wide billings in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. As master distributors, Synnex and Starin fulfill transactions to VARs, end users and other distributors. No other customer represented over 10% of billings in 2019 or 2018.
Sales
We sell and market our offerings through a sales force that manages a channel of value-added resellers, system integrators, consultants and distributors. These third-party representatives specialize in understanding both audio/video systems and IT networking. In fiscal 2018, we utilized two master distributors in the U.S. and reduced our reliance on them in fiscal 2019. We also sold to approximately 300 resellers, and over 1,150 total end users. Our focus has been primarily to customers we have identified as having the greatest potential for high use; that is, organizations with presenters, trainers, lecturers, marketers, event planners and leaders who have a routine need to communicate to many people in higher education, government, health and certain corporate markets. Reseller, customer interest and sales outside the United States has grown and accordingly, we made two international acquisitions in fiscal 2014 in the Netherlands and Japan, significantly increasing our international headcount in sales, operations, technical and administrative positions. To date, we have sold our products to customers in over 65 countries outside the United States. Total billings for Mediasite product and support outside the United States totaled 36% in both fiscal 2019 and 2018. 
Market expansion: Over two-thirds of our revenue is realized from the education market. Recent trends are driving more students, particularly adult learners, to seek online education options. Similarly, demand for lecture capture within undergraduate, community college and blended learning programs is demonstrating growth. This development represents an emerging trend beyond the traditional academic customer base for the company, which has primarily consisted of post-graduate, distance learning and technical degree programs.
For our higher education as well as corporate, government and association clients, we anticipate economic conditions will expand market demand for more outsourced services versus licensed sales. Over the last two years, the company has made extensive capital and technology investments to advance its services model with turnkey event webcasting, a comprehensive cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) datacenter, and e-commerce capabilities that position us well to deliver more diversified business services.
With Mediasite Events, we continue to see growing demand for conference webcasting and streaming. These event-based communication, education and training applications, combined with outsourced webcasting services, are expected to drive the company’s corporate sales activities going forward.
Repeat orders: Many customers initially purchase a small number of Mediasite Recorders to test or pilot in a department, school or business unit. A successful pilot project and the associated increase in webcasting demand from other departments or schools leads to follow up, multiple Recorder orders, as well as increased Mediasite Video Platform or Mediasite Video Cloud capacity. In fiscal 2019, 93% of billings were to preexisting customers compared to 91% of billings in fiscal 2018.
Renewals: As is typical in the industry, we offer annual support and maintenance service contract extensions for a fee to our customer base. Nearly all customers purchase a Customer Care plan with their initial Mediasite Recorders and Mediasite Video Platform, and the majority renew their contracts annually.

Marketing
In the enterprise, our marketing strategy is based on a cross-industry approach with programs targeting a blend of IT and line of business decision makers responsible for video initiatives in corporate communications, training and development, live webcasting and/or corporate events. The addition of Mediasite Join to our family of enterprise video solutions boosts demand generation marketing to specifically target use cases for streaming and managing the rapidly growing amount of unified communication and collaboration (UCC)-generated video. The medical/healthcare, pharmaceutical and technology segments are particularly strong enterprise markets for us.
Across higher education institutions, Mediasite maintains its market leadership position for scalable and affordable lecture capture and video management. Our marketing focuses on professional schools of business, academic health, law and engineering. Mediasite Join provides new demand generation opportunities as UCC technologies are the basis of many distance learning programs.
Spanning both education and enterprise are marketing programs targeting continuing education. Across these two macro markets we maintain a balanced blend of new demand generation and customer nurturing, to drive Mediasite expansion and add-on business in existing accounts.
Our integrated marketing strategy leverages:

• | Customer success stories regularly shared through our best practices webinar series, speaking placements at industry events, email marketing, industry guest columns and blog


• | Thought leadership content created and curated from customer successes, Sonic Foundry subject matter experts (SMEs) and industry experts in the form of ebooks, whitepapers, videos, best practice toolkits and more


• | The Mediasite Community, a vibrant online community of 2000+ users and its companion community events including the global Mediasite User Conference, Unleash; Mediasite Summits in Europe and Australia/New Zealand; and year-round regional chapter meetings

Sonic Foundry also has field sales/support personnel in Europe, Japan and China to deliver its marketing message and execute region-specific marketing programs.
Operations
We contract with a third party to build the hardware for our Mediasite Recorders and purchase quantities sufficient to fill specific customer orders, including purchases of inventory by resellers. Quantities are maintained in inventory by the third-party provider and shipped directly to the end customer or reseller. The hardware manufacturer provides a limited one-year warranty on the hardware, which we pass on to our customers who purchase a Mediasite Customer Care support and maintenance plan. We believe there are alternative sources of manufacturing for our recorders and believe there are numerous additional sources and alternatives to the existing production process. We have experienced delays in production of our products and component parts used in our products in the past and have maintained excess quantities of inventory to mitigate the risk of such delays. In order to improve liquidity, we have reduced the balance of inventory we maintain and are therefore more likely to experience a short-term outage of inventory. To date, we have not experienced any material returns due to product defects.
OTHER INFORMATION
Competition
Various vendors provide lecture capture, enterprise webcasting or video content management capabilities, but few offer an end-to-end solution that addresses all phases of the video content lifecycle (capture, delivery, transformation and management) in a single platform like Mediasite.
Lecture capture solutions designed specifically for higher education differ in their technology approach.

• | Appliance- or room-based lecture capture provides a fully integrated system with complete recording automation for live or on-demand content. The automated, pre-scheduled workflow results in the greatest faculty and staff adoption and largest volumes of recorded content in the shortest amount of time.


• | Software-based lecture capture that resides on a podium or computer in the classroom also captures and publishes rich media content, but relies on campus- or user-supplied hardware.

10

Sonic Foundry, Inc.
Annual Report on Form 10-K
For the Year Ended September 30, 2019


• | Desktop capture tools reside on individual users’ laptops or computers allowing them to record user-generated content.

Few lecture capture vendors offer a mix of all lecture capture approaches to best suit customers’ needs. Most vendors, including Crestron and Panopto support only one approach to lecture capture. Likewise, a very small number of vendors provide an integrated platform like Mediasite to archive and manage video and rich media recorded with their solution. Most rely on a third-party platform, typically the institution’s learning or course management system, to publish, search and secure content.
Enterprise video management solutions serve as centralized media repositories that facilitate the delivery, publishing and management of on-demand video. Unlike Mediasite, most platforms do not include a video capture, webcasting or live streaming component, but instead ingest or import video-based content captured by other third-party devices or solutions. Also, most other platforms focus on ingesting video-only content rather than rich video which combines multiple synchronous video and/or slide streams into an interactive media experience.
Some current and potential customers develop their own home-grown lecture capture, webcasting or video content solutions which may also compete with Mediasite. However, we often find many of these organizations are now looking for a commercial solution that offers comprehensive management capabilities, requires fewer resources and internal maintenance and delivers a less cumbersome workflow.
Intellectual Property
The status of United States patent protection in the internet industry is not well defined and will evolve as the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office grants additional patents. Currently three U.S. patents have been issued to us and we may seek additional patents in the future. We do not know if any future patent application will result in any patents being issued with the scope of the claims we seek, if such patents are issued at all. We do not know whether our patents which have been issued or any patents we may receive in the future will be challenged, invalidated or be of any value. It is difficult to monitor unauthorized use of technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States, and our competitors may independently develop technology similar to ours. We will continue to seek patent and other intellectual property protections, when appropriate, for those aspects of our technology that we believe constitute innovations providing significant competitive advantages. Any future patent applications may not result in the issuance of valid patents.
Our success depends in part upon our rights to proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret, trademark and contractual protection to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We have registered three U.S. and four foreign country trademarks. We require our employees to enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements upon commencement of employment. Before we will disclose any confidential aspects of our services, technology or business plans to customers, potential business distribution partners and other non-employees, we routinely require such persons to enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements. In addition, we require all employees, and those consultants involved in the deployment of our services, to agree to assign to us any proprietary information, inventions or other intellectual property they generate, or come to possess, while employed by us. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our services or technology. These precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property.
Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights, trademarks and similar proprietary rights. In addition, we may be subject to claims of alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties or may be required to defend against alleged infringement claims filed against our customers due to indemnification agreements. We may be unaware of filed patent applications which have not yet been made public and which relate to our services.
Intellectual property claims may be asserted against us in the future. Intellectual property litigation is expensive and time-consuming and could divert management’s attention away from running our business. Intellectual property litigation could also require us to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements. These royalty or license agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure or inability to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm our business.
Research and Development
We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to develop new business, and to enhance our existing business. Accordingly, we invest a significant amount of our resources in research and development activities. During the 
11

Sonic Foundry, Inc.
Annual Report on Form 10-K
For the Year Ended September 30, 2019

fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, we spent $7.4 million and $7.1 million, respectively, on internal research and development activities in our business. These amounts represent 21% of total revenue in each of those years.
Global Expansion
We acquired Sonic Foundry International in the Netherlands and Mediasite KK in Japan in fiscal 2014. With these acquisitions, we significantly expanded our global market reach in the Asia-Pacific Region and Europe, and accelerated our commitment to enterprise video communication world-wide.
Employees
At September 30, 2019 and 2018, we had 183 and 198 full-time employees, respectively. Our employees are not represented by a labor union, nor are they subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced a work stoppage and believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.
