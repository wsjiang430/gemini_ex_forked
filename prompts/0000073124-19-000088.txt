ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Northern Trust Corporation
Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation) is a financial holding company that is a leading provider of wealth management, asset servicing, asset management and banking solutions to corporations, institutions, families and individuals. The Corporation conducts business through various U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries, including The Northern Trust Company (Bank). The Corporation was originally formed as a holding company for the Bank in 1971. The Corporation has a network of offices in 20 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., and across 23 locations in Canada, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. At December 31, 2018, the Corporation had consolidated total assets of $132.2 billion and stockholders’ equity of $10.5 billion.
The Bank is an Illinois banking corporation headquartered in Chicago and the Corporation’s principal subsidiary. Founded in 1889, the Bank conducts its business through its U.S. operations and its various U.S. and non-U.S. branches and subsidiaries. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had consolidated assets of $131.7 billion and common bank equity capital of $9.6 billion.
The Corporation expects that the Bank will continue in the foreseeable future to be the major source of the Corporation’s consolidated assets, revenues, and net income. Except where the context otherwise requires, references to “Northern Trust,” “we,” “us,” “our” or similar terms mean Northern Trust Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
Business Overview
Northern Trust focuses on managing and servicing client assets through its two client-focused reporting segments: Corporate & Institutional Services (C&IS) and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to C&IS and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. The revenue and expenses of Asset Management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to C&IS and Wealth Management. Northern Trust reports certain income and expense items not allocated to C&IS and Wealth Management in a third reporting segment, Treasury and Other.
CORPORATE & INSTITUTIONAL SERVICES
C&IS is a leading global provider of asset servicing and related services to corporate and public retirement funds, foundations, endowments, fund managers, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional investors around the globe. Asset servicing and related services encompass a full range of capabilities including, but not limited to: custody; fund administration; investment operations outsourcing; investment management; investment risk and analytical services; employee benefit services; securities lending; foreign exchange; treasury management; brokerage services; transition management services; banking; and cash management. Client relationships are managed through the Bank and the Bank’s and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries, including support from locations in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region. At December 31, 2018, total C&IS assets under custody/administration, assets under custody, and assets under management were $9.49 trillion, $6.97 trillion, and $790.8 billion, respectively.
WEALTH MANAGEMENT
Wealth Management focuses on high-net-worth individuals and families, business owners, executives, professionals, retirees, and established privately-held businesses in its target markets. The business also includes the Global Family Office, which provides customized services to meet the complex financial needs of individuals and family offices in the United States and throughout the world with assets typically exceeding $200 million. In supporting these targeted segments, Wealth Management provides trust, investment management, custody, and philanthropic services; financial consulting; guardianship and estate administration; family business consulting; family financial education; brokerage services; and private and business banking. 
Wealth Management is one of the largest providers of advisory services in the United States, with assets under custody/administration, assets under custody, and assets under management of $634.8 billion, $622.9 billion, and $278.6 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2018. Wealth Management services are delivered by multidisciplinary teams through a network of offices in 18 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., as well as offices in London, Guernsey, and Abu Dhabi.
ASSET MANAGEMENT
Asset Management, through the Corporation’s various subsidiaries, supports the C&IS and Wealth Management reporting segments by providing a broad range of asset management and related services and other products to clients around the world. Investment solutions are delivered through separately managed accounts, bank common and collective funds, 

2018 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 1 

registered investment companies, exchange traded funds, non-U.S. collective investment funds, and unregistered private investment funds. Asset Management’s capabilities include active and passive equity; active and passive fixed income; cash management; alternative asset classes (such as private equity and hedge funds of funds); and multi-manager advisory services and products. Asset Management’s activities also include overlay services and other risk management services. Asset Management operates internationally through subsidiaries and distribution arrangements and its revenue and expense are fully allocated to C&IS and Wealth Management. As discussed above, Northern Trust managed $1.07 trillion in assets as of December 31, 2018, including $790.8 billion for C&IS clients and $278.6 billion for Wealth Management clients.
Competition
Northern Trust faces intense competition in all aspects and areas of its business. Competition comes from both regulated and unregulated financial services organizations, whose products and services span the local, national, and global markets in which Northern Trust conducts operations. Our competitors include a broad range of financial institutions and service companies, including other custodial banks, deposit-taking institutions, asset management firms, benefits consultants, trust companies, investment banking firms, insurance companies, investment counseling firms, and various financial technology companies, including software providers and data services firms. As our businesses grow and markets evolve, we may encounter increasing and new forms of competition around the world.
Northern Trust’s principal business strategy is to provide quality financial services to targeted market segments in which it believes it has a competitive advantage and favorable growth prospects. As part of this strategy, Northern Trust seeks to deliver a level of service that distinguishes it from its competitors. In addition, Northern Trust emphasizes the development and growth of recurring sources of fee-based income. Northern Trust seeks to develop and expand its recurring fee-based revenue by identifying select markets with attractive growth characteristics and providing a high level of individualized service to clients in those markets. Northern Trust also seeks to preserve its asset quality through established credit review procedures and to maintain a conservative balance sheet. 
Economic Conditions And Government Policies
The earnings of Northern Trust are affected by numerous external influences. Chief among these are general economic conditions, both domestic and international, and actions that governments and their central banks take in managing their economies. These general conditions affect all of Northern Trust’s businesses, as well as the quality, value, and profitability of their loan and investment portfolios.
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) implements monetary policy through its open market operations in United States Government securities, its setting of the discount rate at which member banks may borrow from Federal Reserve Banks, and its changes in the reserve requirements for deposits. The policies adopted by the Federal Reserve Board directly affect interest rates and therefore what banks earn on their loans and investments and what they pay on their savings and time deposits and other purchased funds.
Supervision And Regulation
Northern Trust is subject to extensive regulation under state and federal laws in the United States, as well as the applicable laws of each of the various jurisdictions outside the United States in which Northern Trust does business. The discussion below outlines significant elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to Northern Trust. Changes in these laws or regulations, or their application, cannot be predicted, but may have a material effect on Northern Trust’s businesses and results of operations.
FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY REGULATION
Under U.S. law, the Corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHCA). Consequently, the Corporation and its business activities throughout the world are subject to the supervision, examination, and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board. The BHCA and other federal laws subject bank and financial holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements, including enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. Supervision and regulation of bank holding companies, financial holding companies, and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and other clients of banking subsidiaries, the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the banking system as a whole, not for the protection of stockholders or other nondepository creditors.
Under the BHCA, bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking. As a financial holding company, the Corporation is permitted to engage in other activities that the Federal Reserve Board determines to be financial in nature, incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally, or to acquire shares of companies engaged 

2 2018 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 

in such activities. Activities defined to be financial in nature include: providing financial or investment advice; securities underwriting and dealing; insurance underwriting; and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies, subject to significant limitations. They also include activities previously determined by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. The Corporation may not, however, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of a bank holding company or a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.
In order to maintain the Corporation’s status as a financial holding company, the Bank, as the Corporation’s sole insured depository institution subsidiary, must remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” under applicable regulations, and must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). In addition, as a result of the amendment of the BHCA by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), as discussed further below, the Corporation must remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company. Failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean, depending on the requirements not met, that the Corporation could not undertake new activities, continue certain activities, or make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies.
SUBSIDIARY REGULATION
The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System, its eligible deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum authorized limit, and it is subject to regulation by both these agencies. As an Illinois banking corporation, the Bank is also subject to Illinois state laws and regulations and to examination and supervision by the Division of Banking of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. The Bank is also registered as a transfer agent with the Federal Reserve Board and is therefore subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board in this area.
The Bank is registered provisionally as a swap dealer with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) under the Commodity Exchange Act and is a member of the National Futures Association (NFA). As a provisionally registered swap dealer, the Bank is subject to significant regulatory obligations regarding swap activity and the supervision, examination and enforcement powers of the CFTC, NFA, and other regulators. Certain of the Corporation’s other affiliates are registered with the CFTC as commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators under the Commodity Exchange Act, are members of the NFA, and are subject to that act and the associated rules and regulations of the CFTC and NFA.
The Corporation’s nonbanking affiliates are all subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board. Its broker-dealer subsidiary is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a broker-dealer and an investment adviser and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, subject to the rules and regulations of both of these bodies. The Corporation’s broker-dealer subsidiary also is registered with the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board as a municipal securities dealer. Several subsidiaries of the Corporation are registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and are subject to that act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Those subsidiaries also act as investment advisers to various mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and hedge funds of funds that are subject to regulation by the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Other subsidiaries are regulated by state regulators in various states.
FUNCTIONAL REGULATION
Federal banking law has established a system of federal and state supervision and regulation based on functional regulation, meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity. Banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators, insurance by state insurance regulators, derivatives activities by the CFTC, and securities activities by the SEC and state securities regulators.
A significant component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal securities laws and SEC oversight of some bank securities activities. Generally, banks may conduct securities activities without broker-dealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activity-based exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities. Securities activities outside these exemptions, as a practical matter, need to be conducted by a registered broker-dealer affiliate. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as an investment adviser to a registered investment company.
Another component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal commodity and derivatives laws and CFTC oversight of some bank commodity and derivatives activities, including swap-dealing activities.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT, AS AMENDED
The Dodd-Frank Act has had a broad impact on the financial services industry, imposing significant new regulatory and compliance requirements, including the imposition of increased capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements, and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthen safety and soundness within, the financial services sector. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act established a new framework of authority to conduct systemic risk oversight within the U.S. financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Federal Reserve Board, and the FDIC. In May 2018, the U.S. Congress passed, and the President signed, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Regulatory Relief Act”), which revised parts of the Dodd-Frank Act and directed the Federal Reserve Board and other federal regulators to revise parts of their regulations. The Federal Reserve Board has finalized or proposed some of the regulatory changes required by the Regulatory Relief Act, but other required changes remain to be finalized and/or proposed. The Corporation cannot predict what changes may occur to the Dodd-Frank Act as a result of the Regulatory Relief Act or the ultimate effect such changes would have on the Corporation. The following items provide a brief description of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended, that currently are the most relevant to the Corporation and its subsidiaries, including the Bank.
Enhanced Prudential Standards. The Dodd-Frank Act imposed enhanced prudential requirements on U.S. bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, including the Corporation. The enhanced prudential standards include more stringent risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management, and stress testing requirements and single counterparty credit limits for large bank holding companies, including the Corporation. The Federal Reserve Board also has the discretion to require these large U.S. bank holding companies to limit their short-term debt, to issue contingent capital instruments, and to provide enhanced public disclosures. The Federal Reserve Board has issued final rules implementing enhanced prudential standards for more stringent risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management, stress testing requirements, and aggregate credit exposure limits. Under the final rules, the Corporation must submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve Board, be subject to supervisor-conducted periodic stress tests to evaluate capital adequacy in adverse economic conditions, conduct capital stress tests, implement enhanced risk management procedures, comply with a liquidity risk management framework (discussed below in “Liquidity Standards”) and aggregate credit exposure limits, conduct liquidity stress tests, and hold a buffer of liquid assets estimated to meet funding needs during a financial stress event. The Federal Reserve Board also has proposed rules that would implement early remediation requirements that are required to be established under section 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
The Regulatory Relief Act immediately increased the threshold for imposing enhanced prudential standards on U.S. bank holding companies from $50 billion to $100 billion in total consolidated assets. This threshold will further increase to $250 billion in November 2019 for all U.S. bank holding companies, but the Federal Reserve Board retains the ability to apply enhanced prudential standards to certain U.S. bank holding companies with between $100 billion and $250 billion in total consolidated assets. To implement this change, in October 2018, the Federal Reserve Board proposed creating risk-based categories of banking organizations, each of which would be subject to a tailored set of the enhanced prudential standards. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that, assuming it finalizes the October 2018 proposal without further modification, the Corporation will be a Category II institution, which means that the Corporation would remain subject to the existing enhanced prudential standards described above, but would not be subject to the total loss-absorbing capacity requirement, capital surcharge, enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, or aggregate credit exposure limit that apply to U.S. bank holding companies that are global systemically important bank holding companies. As of the date of this report, the Federal Reserve Board has not finalized the October 2018 proposal and the Corporation cannot predict whether the October 2018 proposal will be finalized and whether such finalization would alter the way in which the enhanced prudential standards are applied to the Corporation.
Resolution Planning. As required by Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC jointly issued a final rule that requires each U.S. bank holding company with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, including the Corporation, to submit periodically to regulators a resolution plan for such bank holding company’s rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. In addition, the FDIC issued a final rule (the “CIDI Resolution Plan Rule”) that requires insured depository institutions with more than $50 billion in total assets, including the Bank, to submit to the FDIC periodic plans for resolution in the event of such institution’s failure. The Regulatory Relief Act immediately raised the threshold for application of the resolution planning requirement to $100 billion, and this threshold will further increase to $250 billion in November 2019, although the Federal Reserve Board retains the ability to apply enhanced prudential standards to certain U.S. bank holding companies with between $100 billion and $250 billion in total consolidated assets. The Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have indicated that in light of the Regulatory Relief Act, the agencies will publish proposals and solicit comment on revisions to the resolution planning requirements. Until such time as the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC propose and finalize changes to the resolution 

4 2018 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 

planning requirements, the Corporation and the Bank will be required to submit resolution plans pursuant to the existing rules; provided, however, that the agencies have indicated that the Corporation is not required to submit a Section 165(d) resolution plan before December 31, 2019 and the FDIC has indicated that the Bank is not required to submit an insured depository institution resolution plan before July 1, 2020.
On March 24, 2017, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC provided joint written feedback to the Corporation regarding the resolution plan submitted by the Corporation in December 2015 pursuant to Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “2015 165(d) Plan”). The joint written feedback identified certain “shortcomings” in the Corporation’s 2015 165(d) Plan. While the identification of these shortcomings is different from a determination that the plan is not “credible”, the Corporation was required to address the shortcomings in a satisfactory manner in the Corporation’s resolution plan to be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC by December 31, 2017. This plan was submitted on December 19, 2017 (the “2017 165(d) Plan”). If the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC jointly decide that the 2017 165(d) Plan fails to address the identified shortcomings in a satisfactory manner, then the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC could jointly determine that the 2017 165(d) Plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In the event of such a joint determination, the Corporation could be subject to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements, restrictions on growth, activities or operations, or be required to divest certain assets or operations. To date, no formal written feedback or guidance has been received regarding the 2017 165(d) Plan. In addition, on June 27, 2018, the Bank submitted its resolution plan (the “2018 CIDI Plan”) to the FDIC under the CIDI Resolution Plan Rule. To date, no formal written feedback or guidance has been received regarding the 2018 CIDI Plan.
Separately, the European Union Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), was adopted for European Union credit institutions, including certain of the Bank’s subsidiaries and branches, effective January 1, 2015. In accordance with applicable Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) guidance, a recovery plan for Northern Trust Global Services Limited (since reincorporated as Northern Trust Global Services SE), a UK incorporated indirect subsidiary of the Bank, has been established and will be reviewed at least annually. PRA guidance also requires institutions to produce resolution planning information. In accordance with such guidance, a resolution pack for Northern Trust Global Services SE and the Bank’s London branch has been prepared and such information will be reviewed every two years. 
The Corporation and the Bank have and will continue to focus management attention and substantial resources to meet U.S. and European regulatory expectations with respect to these resolution planning requirements.
Orderly Liquidation Authority. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, certain financial companies, such as the Corporation and certain of its covered subsidiaries, can be subjected to an orderly liquidation authority. For the orderly liquidation authority to apply, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President of the United States, must make a determination, among other things, that the Corporation is in default or danger of default, the failure of the Corporation and its resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States, no viable private sector alternative is available to prevent the default of the Corporation, and orderly liquidation authority proceedings would mitigate these adverse effects. This determination must be recommended by two-thirds of the FDIC Board of Directors and two-thirds of the Federal Reserve Board. Absent such actions, the Corporation, as a bank holding company, would remain subject to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. If the Corporation were subject to orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC would be appointed as its receiver, which would give the FDIC considerable powers to resolve the Corporation, including: (1) the power to remove officers and directors and appoint new ones; (2) the power to assign assets and liabilities to a third party or bridge financial company without the need for creditor consent or prior court review; (3) the ability to differentiate among creditors, including by treating junior creditors better than senior creditors, subject to a minimum recovery right to receive at least what such senior creditors would have received in bankruptcy liquidation; and (4) broad powers to administer the claims process to determine distributions from the assets of the receivership to creditors not transferred to a third party or bridge financial institution.
The Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule bans proprietary trading subject to exceptions for market-making, hedging, certain trading activities in U.S. and foreign sovereign debt, certain trading activities of non-U.S. banking entities trading outside the United States, and trading activities related to liquidity management. The Volcker Rule also maintains significant restrictions on sponsoring or investing in certain “covered funds,” such as hedge funds or private equity funds. A banking entity may “organize and offer” certain private funds only if certain requirements are satisfied. Moreover, a banking entity only may retain a limited ownership interest in such funds, and must monitor and track investments in such covered funds carefully to ensure that the ownership interest in the fund does not exceed regulatory thresholds. Generally, a banking entity that sponsors or invests in certain private funds is also restricted from providing credit or other support to the funds or permitting the funds to use the name of the bank. The Volcker Rule requires large banking entities, including the Corporation, to implement a detailed compliance program and, on an annual basis, requires the Chief Executive Officer of the banking entity to attest that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rule. Compliance with the Volcker Rule generally has been required since July 21, 2015. Northern Trust has conducted an 

2018 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 5 

enterprise-wide review of affected activities, taken steps to bring those activities into conformance, and has established an enterprise-wide compliance program to comply with the Volcker Rule. 
In July 2018, the Federal Reserve Board and other federal regulatory agencies having oversight over the Volcker Rule proposed amendments to the rule. The notice of proposed rulemaking contains certain revisions to the Volcker Rule’s restrictions. Northern Trust is evaluating the proposal to determine the impact such proposal will have, if any, if it becomes effective, but as of the date of this report, no final rule amendments have been issued. The full impact of the Volcker Rule on Northern Trust ultimately will depend on the finalization of the July 2018 proposed amendments and further interpretation and guidance by the regulatory agencies responsible for its enforcement. Northern Trust is monitoring developments with respect to the Volcker Rule actively and will revise further its operations and compliance programs as appropriate or required.
Swaps and Other Derivatives. Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act (Title VII) imposes a regulatory structure on the over-the-counter derivatives market, including requirements for clearing, exchange trading, capital, margin, trade reporting, and recordkeeping. Title VII also requires certain persons to register as a “major swap participant,” a “swap dealer,” a “major-security-based swap participant” or a “security-based swap dealer.” The CFTC has finalized most rules further defining these registrant categories, while the SEC continues to draft rules related to security-based swaps. The CFTC’s Title VII rules and regulations are applicable to the Bank’s activity as a swap dealer and include rules related to internal and external business conduct standards, reporting and recordkeeping, mandatory clearing for certain swaps, and trade documentation and confirmation requirements, and applied certain regulatory requirements to cross-border swap activities. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has finalized regulations applicable to the Bank regarding mandatory posting and collection of margin by certain swap counterparties. The SEC’s rules related to security-based swaps are not currently applicable to the Bank’s swap dealing activity and the Bank’s current trading activity does not mandate its regulation as a security-based swap dealer. Northern Trust continues to monitor Title VII-related regulatory developments and will revise further its operations and/or swaps compliance program as appropriate or required. 
Incentive Compensation Arrangements. The Dodd-Frank Act requires federal regulators to prescribe regulations or guidelines regarding incentive-based compensation practices at certain large financial institutions. No final rule has been issued to date.
HOLDING COMPANY SUPPORT UNDER THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT
The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) to obligate the Federal Reserve Board to require bank holding companies, such as the Corporation, to serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary depository institution. The term “source of financial strength” is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at such subsidiaries. Under this requirement, the Corporation in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank should the Bank experience financial distress.
PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS
The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The Corporation may pay dividends, repurchase stock, and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the Federal Reserve Board and as to which the Federal Reserve Board has not objected. A significant source of funds for the Corporation is dividends from the Bank. As a result, the Corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations and fund dividend payments. Dividend payments from the Bank are subject to Illinois law and to regulatory limitations, generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings, imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability, financial condition or cash flow requirements.
Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the Bank can pay to the Corporation without regulatory approval. Approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required for payment of any dividend by a state-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year (including any prospective dividend) would exceed the total of its retained net income (as defined by regulatory agencies) for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years. In addition, a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its “undivided profits,” as defined, without regulatory and stockholder approval.
The Bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividends if the Bank is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividends would cause the Bank to become undercapitalized. In addition, the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The payment of dividends could, depending on the financial condition of the Bank, be deemed to constitute an unsafe or 

6 2018 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 

unsound practice. The Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III (as defined and discussed further below) impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends.
CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING
The Corporation’s capital distributions are subject to Federal Reserve Board oversight. The major component of that oversight is the Federal Reserve Board’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) exercise, implementing its capital plan rules. These rules require bank holding companies having $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets (including the Corporation) to submit annual capital plans to their respective Federal Reserve Bank. The Corporation also is required to collect and report certain related data on a quarterly basis to allow the Federal Reserve Board to monitor progress against the annual capital plans. The CCAR exercise is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies as well as of the processes used by certain bank holding companies to assess their capital needs. Through CCAR, the Federal Reserve Board assesses whether bank holding companies have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress. The Corporation and other affected bank holding companies may pay dividends, repurchase stock, and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan as to which the Federal Reserve Board has not objected. The Federal Reserve Board may object to a capital plan for a number of reasons, including if the capital plan does not show that the covered bank holding company will meet, for each quarter throughout the nine-quarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan, all minimum regulatory capital ratios under applicable capital rules as in effect for that quarter, as well as all minimum regulatory capital ratios on a pro forma basis under the base case and stressful scenarios. The capital plan rules also stipulate that a covered bank holding company may not make a capital distribution, unless after giving effect to the distribution, it will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios.
On January 30, 2017, the Federal Reserve Board announced modifications to capital plan and stress testing rules. Under the modified final rules, the qualitative assessment of CCAR was removed for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets between $50 billion and $250 billion, irrespective of the amount of on-balance-sheet foreign exposure held by such bank holding companies. As a result, capital plans submitted by the Corporation currently are no longer subject to objection from the Federal Reserve Board on qualitative grounds. In lieu of the qualitative assessment of CCAR, the Corporation is subject to a horizontal capital review (HCR), focusing on specific areas of capital planning, conducted as part of the Federal Reserve Board’s normal supervisory process. Any supervisory findings resulting from the HCR are addressed through supervisory communications. Capital plans submitted by the Corporation remain subject to objection from the Federal Reserve Board on quantitative grounds.
The Corporation submitted its capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board in April 2018 as part of the Federal Reserve Board’s 2018 CCAR exercise, and the Federal Reserve Board did not object to the Corporation’s plan. The Corporation will submit its 2019 capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board by April 5, 2019. The Federal Reserve Board is expected to publish either its objection or non-objection to the 2019 capital plan and proposed capital actions, such as dividend payments and share repurchases, in mid-2019.
In addition to the CCAR stress testing requirements, Federal Reserve Board regulations include Dodd-Frank Act stress tests (DFAST). Under the DFAST regulations, the Corporation is required to undergo regulatory stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve Board annually, and to conduct internal stress tests pursuant to regulatory requirements semi-annually. The Bank also is required to conduct its own annual internal stress test (although it is permitted to combine certain reporting and disclosure of its stress test results with the results of the Corporation). These requirements involve both company-run and supervisory-run testing of capital under various scenarios, including baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios provided by the appropriate banking regulator. Results from the Corporation’s and the Bank’s annual company-run stress tests are reported to the appropriate regulators and published. Northern Trust published the results of its company-run stress tests on June 21, 2018, and the results of its company-run mid-cycle stress tests on October 31, 2018.
In April 2018, the Federal Reserve Board proposed revisions to the CCAR exercise and DFAST regulations that would in part integrate the forward-looking stress test results with the non-stress capital requirements discussed below by using the results of the annual supervisory stress test to set specific buffer requirements above minimum capital requirements, which restrict capital distributions under the capital rule and establish a single approach to capital distribution limitations. The April 2018 proposal also would replace the 2.5% capital conservation buffer requirement with a stress capital buffer requirement and establish a stress leverage buffer requirement in addition to the minimum 4% Tier 1 leverage ratio requirement. Under the April 2018 proposal, an institution would be required to maintain capital ratios above its minimum plus its buffer requirements in order to avoid restrictions on its capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. An institution would be bound by the most stringent distribution limitations, if any, as determined by its capital conservation buffer requirement, its stress leverage buffer requirement and, if applicable, its advanced approaches capital conservation buffer requirement and enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standard.

2018 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 7 

The April 2018 proposal also would remove the stress testing assumption that an institution would make all planned capital distributions over the planning horizon, including any planned common stock dividends and repurchases of common stock. Instead, the stress buffer requirements would include only four quarters of planned common stock dividends in order to preserve the incentives for an institution to engage in disciplined, forward-looking dividend planning. Further, the April 2018 proposal would adjust the methodology used in the supervisory stress test to assume that the institution takes actions to maintain a constant level of assets, including loans, trading assets, and securities over the planning horizon and assume that the institution’s risk-weighted assets and leverage ratio denominator generally remain unchanged over the planning horizon. The April 2018 proposal also would remove the quantitative objection in CCAR and eliminate the 30 percent dividend payout ratio as a criterion for heightened scrutiny of an institution's capital plan. The Federal Reserve Board would retain the CCAR qualitative supervisory review and the ability to object to an institution’s capital plan on qualitative grounds based on the adequacy of the institution’s capital planning processes (qualitative objection) for institutions supervised by the Large Institution Supervision Coordination Committee and other large and complex institutions.
Separately, the Regulatory Relief Act immediately raised the threshold for application of DFAST regulations to $100 billion, and this threshold will further increase to $250 billion in November 2019. However, the Regulatory Relief Act did not directly affect the CCAR exercise. In its October 2018 proposal described above, the Federal Reserve Board proposed that the Corporation will be subject to the qualitative and quantitative assessments of the CCAR exercise and the DFAST regulations, but did not address the April 2018 proposal. As of the date of this filing, the Federal Reserve Board has not finalized the April 2018 or October 2018 proposals, and the Corporation cannot predict whether either proposal will be finalized and whether such finalization would alter the way in which the CCAR exercise and DFAST regulations are applied to the Corporation.
Additionally, on December 21, 2018, the Federal Reserve Board announced it will not incorporate the current expected credit losses methodology (CECL) from Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 into its supervisory stress tests until at least 2022 to reduce uncertainty, allow for better capital planning at affected firms, and allow the Federal Reserve Board to gather additional information on the impact of CECL. The Federal Reserve Board will still require banking organizations subject to company-run stress test requirements as part of the CCAR exercise to incorporate CECL into their internal stress testing processes beginning in 2020.
CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS
The regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution’s financial soundness. As a general matter, FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies (including the Bank and the Corporation) are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold. The final supervisory determination on an institution’s capital adequacy is based on the regulator’s assessment of numerous factors.
The risk-based capital guidelines that apply to the Corporation and the Bank are based upon the 2011 capital accord of the International Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), a committee of central banks and bank supervisors, as implemented by the Federal Reserve Board (Basel III). The Basel III rules are currently being phased in, and will come into full effect by January 1, 2022.
To implement Basel III for bank holding companies, including the Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board established risk-based and leverage capital guidelines. The federal banking regulators also established risk-based and leverage capital guidelines that FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, are required to meet. These regulations are generally similar to those established by the Federal Reserve Board for bank holding companies. The Bank’s risk-based and leverage capital ratios remained strong at December 31, 2018, and were well above the minimum regulatory requirements established by U.S. banking regulators.
Under the final Basel III rules, the Corporation is one of a small number of “core” banking organizations. The rules require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles, and to disclose publicly certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy. In order to implement the capital rules, a core banking organization, such as the Corporation, is required to complete satisfactorily a parallel run, in which it calculates capital requirements under both the Basel III rules and previously effective regulations. The Corporation and the Bank completed their parallel runs in 2014 and are required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and disclose publicly their risk-based capital ratios.
Pursuant to the Federal Reserve Board’s implementation in the final Basel III rules of a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Corporation is subject to a capital floor that is based on the Basel III standardized approach. The Corporation is therefore required to calculate its risk-based capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches, and is subject to the more stringent of the risk-based capital ratios as calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach in the assessment of its capital adequacy.

8 2018 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 

The risk-based and leverage capital ratios for the Corporation and the Bank, together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “well-capitalized,” are provided in the following chart.
TABLE 1: RISK-BASED AND LEVERAGE CAPITAL RATIOS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018

 | COMMON EQUITYTIER 1 CAPITAL | TIER 1 CAPITAL | TOTAL CAPITAL | TIER 1 LEVERAGE | SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE
 | ADVANCEDAPPROACH | | STANDARDIZEDAPPROACH | | ADVANCEDAPPROACH | | STANDARDIZEDAPPROACH | | ADVANCEDAPPROACH | | STANDARDIZEDAPPROACH | | ADVANCEDAPPROACH | | STANDARDIZEDAPPROACH | | ADVANCEDAPPROACH |

In addition to the above, as of January 1 2018, advanced approaches institutions, such as the Corporation and the Bank, must comply with a supplementary leverage ratio. Under the supplementary leverage ratio rule, advanced approaches institutions are subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. Insured depository institutions that are advanced approaches institutions, such as the Bank, also are required to maintain at least a 3.0% supplementary leverage ratio to be considered “well-capitalized” under the rule. The supplementary leverage ratio differs from the leverage ratio in that the leverage ratio does not take into account certain off-balance-sheet assets and exposures that are reflected in the supplementary leverage ratio.
Basel III also introduced a capital conservation buffer, requiring banking organizations to hold a buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital above the minimum risk-based capital requirements. The minimum capital conservation buffer in 2018 was 1.875% and will increase to 2.5% for 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking organizations with a common equity Tier 1 ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall. Basel III also introduced a “countercyclical buffer” of 0% to 2.5% of a banking organization’s total risk-weighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations, such as the Corporation, which is intended to create a capital buffer for such banking organizations during expansionary economic phases in order to protect against declines in asset prices if credit conditions weaken. In general, the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposures. The U.S. countercyclical buffer is currently set at 0%, and the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that generally it will provide a 12-month phase-in of changes to the minimum required countercyclical buffer and use the notice and comment process to communicate proposed changes to the public. Certain other jurisdictions in which the Corporation has credit exposures currently have countercyclical buffers set at levels greater than 0%, slightly increasing the weighted average countercyclical buffer to which the Corporation is subject.
On December 21, 2018, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule that will permit banking organizations, including the Corporation and the Bank, to elect to phase-in the day-one adverse effects of implementing CECL on regulatory capital calculations over a three-year period. The final rule will take effect April 1, 2019, although CECL is not required to be implemented by public companies until 2020.
As discussed above, in April 2018, the Federal Reserve Board proposed revisions to the Basel III rules that would in part integrate the forward-looking stress test results with the non-stress capital requirements discussed in this section. If implemented, the revisions would establish revised capital requirements for large banking organizations, such as the Corporation, that are institution-specific and risk-sensitive. The April 2018 proposal would also modify several assumptions in the CCAR exercise to align them better with an institution’s expected actions under stress. Separately, the Regulatory Relief Act directed the Federal Reserve Board to revise the Basel III rules to provide relief from the supplementary leverage ratio requirement for certain funds that are deposited with a central bank. Further, in October 2018, the Federal Reserve Board proposed changes to the applicability thresholds for regulatory capital and liquidity requirements for certain large U.S. banking organizations. At the same time, the Federal Reserve Board indicated that, assuming it finalizes the proposal without further modification, the Corporation will be a Category II institution, meaning 

2018 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 9 

that it will become subject to certain additional capital planning and liquidity reporting requirements. As of the date of this report, the Federal Reserve Board has not finalized the April 2018 or October 2018 proposals or proposed rules to implement the relief provided for in the Regulatory Relief Act. The Corporation cannot predict whether the April 2018 or October 2018 proposals will be finalized, whether and when the rules to implement the relief provided for in the Regulatory Relief Act will be proposed and finalized, and whether finalization of any proposal would alter the way in which the Basel III rules are applied to the Corporation and Bank.
LIQUIDITY STANDARDS
In addition to capital adequacy standards, Basel III introduced two quantitative liquidity standards: a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and a net stable funding ratio (NSFR). The LCR is intended to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of covered banking organizations, improve the banking industry’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk. In September 2014, the U.S. banking agencies finalized rules to implement the LCR in the United States for large banking organizations, such as the Corporation and the Bank. Among other things, the finalized LCR rules require covered banking organizations, which include the Corporation and the Bank, to maintain an amount of high-quality liquid assets (HQLAs) equal to or greater than 100% of the banking organization’s total net cash outflows over a thirty-calendar-day standardized supervisory liquidity stress scenario. The LCR has been fully implemented since January 1, 2017. Northern Trust is required to calculate its LCR on a daily basis and disclose publicly certain LCR information on a quarterly basis.
The NSFR requires banking organizations to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance-sheet activities. More specifically, the NSFR requires that the ratio of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding be equal to at least 100% on an ongoing basis. The Basel Committee finalized its NSFR rules in October 2014, which were to be implemented by the Federal Reserve Board as a minimum standard by January 1, 2018. The Federal Reserve Board issued a proposal on May 3, 2016 to implement the NSFR and revised aspects of that proposal in the two October 2018 proposals discussed above, but has not adopted a final rule. 
The enhanced prudential standards (discussed above) specify certain liquidity risk management practices to be followed by covered large U.S. banks and bank holding companies, including the Corporation and the Bank. These practices include an independent review of liquidity risk management and the establishment of cash flow projections, a contingency funding plan, and liquidity risk limits. The Corporation’s Board of Directors (Board) also is required to establish and maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered HQLAs based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing. This liquidity buffer must be tailored to Northern Trust’s business risks and is in addition to other liquidity requirements, such as the LCR and NSFR discussed above. The enhanced prudential standards also establish requirements and responsibilities for the Board of Directors and its Business Risk Committee with respect to liquidity risk management. The enhanced prudential standards require Northern Trust to engage in liquidity stress testing under multiple stress scenarios and time horizons tailored to its specific products and risk profile. The Board of Directors has approved a liquidity management policy establishing the principles and guidelines for the Corporation to govern the processes and activities for the management of its liquidity position. Among other matters, this policy includes limits and thresholds related to the enhanced prudential standards liquidity buffer and the LCR.
PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION
The FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 requires the appropriate federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. While these regulations apply only to banks, such as the Bank, the Federal Reserve Board is authorized to take appropriate action against a parent bank holding company, such as the Corporation, based on the under-capitalized status of any banking subsidiary. In certain instances, the Corporation would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its under-capitalized banking subsidiary.
As noted above, the Federal Reserve Board has issued proposed rules to implement certain “early remediation requirements” applicable to U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more as required under Section 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Similar to prompt corrective action, the early remediation requirements would require institutions subject to the proposal to take increasingly stringent corrective measures as the institution’s financial condition deteriorates. No final rule implementing Section 166 has been issued as of the date of this report, and the thresholds at which such a final rule would apply have been raised by the Regulatory Relief Act and may be subject to further rulemaking by the Federal Reserve Board.
RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES AND INSIDERS
As an insured depository institution, the Bank is subject to restrictions which govern transactions between FDIC-insured banks and any affiliated entity, whether that entity is the Corporation, as the Bank’s parent holding company, a holding company affiliate of the Bank or a subsidiary of the Bank. Regulation W restrictions apply to certain “covered 

10 2018 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 

transactions,” including extensions of credit, issuance of guarantees, investments or asset purchases. In general, these restrictions require that any extensions of credit must be secured fully with qualifying collateral and are limited, as to any one of the Corporation or such nonbank affiliates, to 10% of the Bank’s capital stock and surplus, and, as to the Corporation and all such nonbank affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the Bank’s capital stock and surplus. These restrictions are also applied to transactions between the Bank and its financial subsidiaries. Furthermore, these transactions must be on terms and conditions that are, or in good faith would be, offered to nonaffiliated companies (i.e., at arm’s length).
The Dodd-Frank Act generally enhanced the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” to include credit exposures related to derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements, and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied. The definition of “affiliate” was expanded to include any investment fund to which the Corporation or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser. The ability of the Federal Reserve Board to grant exemptions from these restrictions was also narrowed, including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators. In addition, the provision in Section 23A that had permitted the Bank to engage in covered transactions with a financial subsidiary of the Bank in an amount greater than 10% (but less than 20%) of the Bank’s capital and surplus has been eliminated.
The restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and their related interests (collectively referred to herein as “insiders”) contained in the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O apply to all federally insured institutions, including the Bank. These restrictions include, among others, limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made. There is also an aggregate limitation on all loans (including credit exposures related to derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements) to insiders and their related interests. These loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus, and the FDIC may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate. Insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced these restrictions and also imposed restrictions on the purchase or sale of assets between banking institutions and insiders.
ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING, ANTI-TERRORISM LEGISLATION, AND OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL
The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which contains anti-money laundering (AML) and financial transparency provisions and requires implementation of regulations applicable to financial services companies, including, but not limited to, standards for conducting due diligence, verifying client identification, and monitoring client transactions and detecting and reporting suspicious activities. AML laws outside the U.S. contain similar requirements. The Corporation and its subsidiaries have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with all applicable AML laws and regulations. Compliance with applicable AML laws and related requirements is a common area of review for financial regulators, and the Corporation’s and its subsidiaries’ failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions or difficulties in obtaining approvals, restrictions on their business activities or harm to their reputation.
In May 2016, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued a new rule that requires certain financial institutions, including the Bank, to obtain beneficial ownership information related to certain legal entity clients. Compliance with the new rule has been required since May 2018. As part of its AML compliance program, Northern Trust has implemented, and continues to maintain, processes and controls to comply with the new beneficial ownership information collection rule.
The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is responsible for requiring that U.S. entities do not engage in business with certain prohibited parties and jurisdictions, as defined by various executive orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC publishes lists of persons, organizations and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, trafficking in narcotics, proliferating weapons of mass destruction or representing other threats to national security, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If the Corporation or the Bank finds a sanctioned name or jurisdiction on any transaction or account, the Corporation or the Bank must reject or block such account or transaction as required, and notify the appropriate authorities.
Many other countries have imposed similar laws and regulations that apply to the Corporation’s non-U.S. offices. The Corporation has established policies and procedures to comply with these laws and the related regulations in all relevant jurisdictions.

DEPOSIT INSURANCE AND ASSESSMENTS
The Bank accepts deposits, and eligible deposits have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limit. The current limit for FDIC insurance for deposit accounts is $250,000 for each depositor account. Under the FDIA, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the insured depository institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a bank’s federal regulatory agency. The FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions. Certain liquid assets are excluded from the deposit insurance assessment base of custody banks that satisfy certain institutional eligibility criteria. This has the effect of reducing the amount of deposit insurance fund insurance premiums due from custody banks. In March 2016, the FDIC finalized a surcharge assessment on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more, such as the Bank, in connection with the Dodd-Frank Act requirement to increase the Deposit Insurance Fund’s minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% without increasing the assessments of small insured depository institutions. This surcharge assessment remained in effect until September 30, 2018, when the reserve ratio reached 1.35%. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, placing new restrictions on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more, such as the Bank, with respect to the deduction of all or a portion of all of their deposit insurance assessment payments as business expenses for federal taxation purposes. As a result of this tax law change, the Bank is no longer able to deduct its FDIC deposit insurance assessment payments.
FIDUCIARY RULE
The U.S. Department of Labor issued a final regulation and related prohibited transaction exemptions, effective June 2017, which significantly expanded the concept of “investment advice” for the purpose of determining fiduciary status to employee benefits plans, plan participants, and individual retirement account (IRA) owners under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). However, in June 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated the final regulation, and related prohibited transaction exemptions, and thus they are no longer in effect. In anticipation of the Fifth Circuit’s action, the Department of Labor issued guidance in May 2018 stating that, pending the issuance of further regulations, exemptions or administrative guidance, it will not pursue prohibited transaction claims against investment advice fiduciaries who are working diligently and in good faith to comply with the “impartial conduct standards” set forth in the vacated regulation for transactions that would have been exempted by the vacated prohibited transaction exemptions. The Corporation is operating under the Department of Labor’s May 2018 guidance pending further developments.
COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT
The Bank is subject to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The CRA and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks. These regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish branches, merger applications, and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. In October 2012, the Federal Reserve Board, the federal regulator responsible for monitoring the Bank’s CRA compliance, approved the designation of the Bank as a “wholesale bank.” As a result of this designation, the Bank fulfills its CRA obligations by making qualified investments for the purposes of community development, rather than retail CRA loans. Federal banking agencies are required to make public the rating of a bank’s performance under the CRA. The Bank received an “outstanding” CRA rating from the Federal Reserve Board in its most recent CRA examination.
PRIVACY AND SECURITY
Federal law establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by, among other provisions, requiring financial institutions to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain limitations on disclosure to third parties of consumer information. Regulations adopted under the federal law set standards for protecting the security, confidentiality and integrity of client information, and require notice of data breaches to regulators, and in some cases, to clients.
Most states, the European Union (EU) and other non-U.S. jurisdictions also have adopted their own statutes and/or regulations concerning financial privacy and security and requiring notification of data breaches. For example, a new European data protection framework - the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - was adopted on April 8, 2016, and became effective in all European Economic Area (EEA) member states on May 25, 2018. GDPR is designed to harmonize data privacy laws across the EEA, to protect EEA citizens’ data privacy and to reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy. GDPR has extraterritorial effect as its scope includes all data controllers and processors outside the EEA whose processing activities relate to the offering of goods or services to, or monitoring the behavior of, EEA individuals. Organizations that violate certain provisions of GDPR could be fined up to €20 million or 4% of their annual global turnover (i.e., revenue) for the preceding fiscal year, whichever is greater.

12 2018 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 

The Corporation has adopted and disseminated privacy policies, and communicates required information relating to financial privacy and data security, in accordance with applicable law.
CONSUMER LAWS AND REGULATIONS
The Corporation’s banking subsidiaries are subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with clients and monitor account activity when taking deposits, making loans to or engaging in other types of transactions with such clients. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to substantial penalties, operating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution. The Dodd-Frank Act established an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) within the Federal Reserve System. The CFPB was tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services. The creation of the CFPB by the Dodd-Frank Act has led to enhanced enforcement of consumer financial protection laws.
NON-U.S. REGULATION
Northern Trust is subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which its non-U.S. branches and subsidiaries operate. For example, branches and subsidiaries conducting banking and asset servicing businesses in the United Kingdom are authorized to do so pursuant to the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. They are authorized by the PRA or the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and regulated by the FCA and, in some instances, also the PRA. The PRA and FCA exercise broad supervisory and disciplinary powers that include the power to revoke temporarily or permanently authorization to conduct a regulated business upon breach of the relevant regulations, suspend registered employees, and impose censures and fines on both regulated businesses and their regulated employees.
Northern Trust’s European branches and subsidiaries are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the EU and the member states in which they are domiciled. Moreover, Northern Trust’s non-European branches and subsidiaries conducting financial services activities also may be within the scope of these laws, given that some EU laws apply to the wider EEA, which includes not only all EU member states but also the non-EU member states Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, and because of increasing extraterritorial effect of European legislation.
The following items provide a brief description of certain recently implemented and in-progress regulatory changes in the EU and UK relevant to the Corporation and its subsidiaries, in addition to the BRRD and GDPR discussed under “The Dodd-Frank Act – Resolution Planning” and “Privacy and Security,” respectively, above. 
Revised Capital Requirements Directive and revised Capital Requirements Regulation. The EU Capital Requirements Directive of June 26, 2013 (CRD) and the EU Capital Requirements Regulation of June 26, 2013 (CRR) govern the legal framework for banking regulation in the EU, including, among other things, own fund requirements. On November 23, 2016, the EU Commission published a proposal for a revision of the CRD (CRD V) and the CRR (CRR II). Formal adoption of CRD V and CRR II by the EU Parliament and European Council has not yet occurred. Further, CRD V and CRR II currently contain mandates for the European Banking Authority (EBA) to produce a number of regulatory technical standards (RTS) and implementing technical standards (ITS), which remain under development.
Central Securities Depositories Regulation. On September 17, 2014, the EU Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR) entered into force (subject to a number of transitional provisions). The CSDR aims principally to ensure that transactions between buyers and sellers of dematerialized securities are settled in a safe and timely manner by introducing common securities settlement standards across the EU. CSDR requires several “Level 2” (or implementing) measures in order for its provisions to take effect fully. A number of these “Level 2” measures were published in 2017. Most recently, on September 13, 2018, the EU Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1229 supplementing the CSDR with regard to technical standards on settlement discipline was published in the EU’s Official Journal. The Delegated Regulation, which is expected to enter into force on September 14, 2020, sets out measures to prevent and address failed settlements and encourage settlement discipline by monitoring failed settlements, collecting and distributing cash penalties for failed settlements, and specifying the operational details of the buy-in process. 
Securities Financing Transactions and Reuse of Collateral Regulation. On November 25, 2015, the EU adopted a regulation on securities financing transactions and reuse of collateral (SFTR) as part of its approach to addressing shadow banking. The regulation includes provisions for enhanced transparency and reporting of securities financing transactions. The SFTR entered into force on January 12, 2016, subject to certain transitional provisions. SFTR requires adoption of certain “Level 2” measures which are being finalized by relevant authorities.
UK Criminal Finances Act. On September 30, 2017, the UK Criminal Finances Act (CFA) entered into force. The CFA has extra-territorial effect, introducing certain new corporate criminal offenses in circumstances where a corporate entity or partnership (a “relevant body”) fails to prevent an “associated person” (broadly meaning an employee, agent or 

2018 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation 13 

person who performs services for or on behalf of the relevant body) from criminally facilitating the evasion of tax, whether the tax evaded is owed (i) in the United Kingdom or (ii) in a foreign country if the relevant body has a nexus, or any conduct constituting part of the foreign tax evasion facilitation offence takes place, in the United Kingdom. These corporate offenses are strict liability offenses, such that in circumstances where an associated person of a relevant body criminally facilitates the evasion of tax and such relevant body has failed to prevent the associated person from committing such criminal facilitation of tax evasion, the relevant body will itself be guilty of a criminal offense carrying unlimited fines, unless it can show that it put in place reasonable prevention procedures (or by showing that it was not reasonable in all the circumstances to expect the relevant body to have any prevention procedures in place).
Benchmarks Regulation. On January 1, 2018, the EU Benchmarks Regulation (BMR) became applicable in all EU member states, subject to certain transitional provisions. The principal objectives of the BMR are to restore investor confidence in the accuracy, robustness and integrity of indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, and the benchmark-setting process itself. The BMR aims to achieve these objectives by ensuring that benchmarks are not subject to conflicts of interest, are used appropriately, and reflect the actual market or economic reality they are intended to measure.
Market in Financial Instruments Directive. On January 3, 2018, the recast Market in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) became applicable to investment services and activities in the EU. MiFID II, together with the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR I), repealed and recast the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (2004/39/EC) (MiFID). Going forward, MiFID II and MiFIR I form the EU legal framework governing the requirements applicable to investment firms, trading venues, data reporting service providers and third-country firms providing investment services or activities in the EU.
Money Market Funds Regulation. On June 30, 2017, an EU regulation on money market funds (MMFR) with a view of making money market funds more resistant to crises and market turbulence was published. Subject to certain transitional provisions, the MMFR became applicable on July 21, 2018 for new money market funds and January 21, 2019 for existing money market funds. It will impose detailed rules relating to the investment policies, risk management and other operational aspects of such funds. Further “Level 2” regulations containing the technical implementation of the MMFR were published in 2018. Technical guidelines to clarify how to comply with certain reporting obligations under MMFR remain under development.
European Deposit Insurance Scheme. On October 11, 2017, the EU Commission announced that it aims to complete all parts of the European Banking Union by 2018. This will require, among other things, the creation of a single European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), applying to deposit guarantee schemes (DGSs) in EU member states participating in the single supervisory mechanism (SSM) and credit institutions in those member states. The EDIS will not directly affect member states that are not participating in the SSM, such as the United Kingdom, meaning that the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), the UK DGS, will not be subject to the EDIS. The EU Council and Parliament continue to consider the legislative proposal for the EDIS regulation, which was published by the EU Commission in November 2015. The EU Commission proposed changes to its approach to the EDIS in its October 2017 communication on completing the banking union but to date has not published any revisions to the text of the EDIS regulation to reflect these changes.
Fifth EU Money Laundering Directive. On July 9, 2018, the Fifth EU Money Laundering Directive (MLD5) entered into force. MLD5 must be transposed into local law by EU member states by January 10, 2020 and introduces the following key changes to the current EU AML regime: (i) EU member states must ensure that registers of ultimate beneficial owners of companies and other legal entities become accessible to the general public; (ii) the current AML regime is extended to additional service providers, such as electronic wallet providers, virtual currency exchange service providers, and art dealers, and further specifications regarding the scope of application of MLD5 with respect to tax advisors and estate agents are provided; (iii) the threshold for identifying holders of prepaid cards is lowered to €150; and (iv) EU member states will be required to implement enhanced due diligence measures to monitor suspicious transactions involving high-risk countries more strictly. 
In addition to the above, the Bank’s and the Corporation’s subsidiary banks located outside the United States are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate. As of December 31, 2018, each of our non-U.S. banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum requirements.
