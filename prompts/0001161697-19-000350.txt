Item 1. Business.
Company

The 4LESS Group, Inc., formerly known as MedCareers Group, Inc. (the “Company”, “MCGI”), was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 5, 2007. The Company formally operated a website for nurses, nursing schools and nurses’ organizations designed for better communication between nurses and the nursing profession.

On November 29, 2018, the Company entered into a transaction (the “Share Exchange”), pursuant to which the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity securities of The 4LESS Corp. (“4LESS”), in exchange for the issuance of (i) nineteen thousand (19,000) shares of Series B Preferred Stock, (ii) six thousand seven hundred fifty (6,750) shares of Series C Preferred Stock, and (iii) 870 shares of Series D Preferred Stock. The Series C Preferred Shares have a right to convert into common stock of the Company by multiplying the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock by 2.63 on the conversion date. The Share Exchange closed on November 29, 2018.  As a result of the Share Exchange, the former shareholders of 4LESS became the controlling shareholders of the Company. The Share Exchange was accounted for as a reverse takeover/recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein 4LESS is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The capital, share price, and earnings per share amount in these consolidated financial statements for the period prior to the reverse merger were restated to reflect the recapitalization in accordance with the shares issued as a result of the reverse merger except otherwise noted.

4LESS was formed as Vegas Suspension & Offroad, LLC on October 24, 2013 as a Nevada limited liability company and converted to a Nevada corporation with the same name on May 8, 2017. On April 2, 2018, the Company changed its name to The 4LESS Corp. The Corporation had S Corporation status. The Corporation operates as an e-commerce auto and truck parts sales company. As a result of the share exchange, the Company is now a holding company operating through 4LESS and offers products including exhaust systems, suspension systems, wheels, tires, stereo systems, truck bed covers, and shocks.

The 4LESS Group, Inc. (“4LESS”, the “Company”, “we” or “us”), the Company described herein, is a Nevada corporation, with offices located at 4580 N. Rancho Dr., #130, Las Vegas, NV 89130 with a remote office at 6515 Goodman Rd., #258, Olive Branch, Mississippi 38654. It can be reached by phone at (662) 510-8992.

 On or around January 7, 2010 the Company’s name was changed to MedCareers Group, Inc. Additionally, as a result of filing the Certificate, the Company’s symbol on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board changed to “MCGI”, effective January 7, 2010.

On or around November 19, 2010, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange”) with Nurses Lounge, Inc., a Texas corporation (“Nurses Lounge”) and the nine shareholders of Nurses Lounge (the “Nurses Lounge Shareholders”). Pursuant to the Exchange, we agreed to issue 24,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock to the Nurses Lounge Shareholders in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Nurses Lounge. Although 24,000,000 restricted shares were issued in connection with the Exchange, certain significant shareholders of the Company also agreed to cancel some of the shares they owned so that the net effect of the Exchange was an increase to the outstanding shares by 7,175,000 shares rather than 24,000,000. Included in the shareholders receiving shares in connection with the Exchange, was Timothy Armes founder and president of Nurses Lounge, Inc., who received 14,902,795 shares. In December 2019 Nurses Lounge was disposed of as more fully described elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in the Notes to the Financial Statements.

The 4LESS Corp

Like many small businesses The 4LESS Corp (“4LESS”) was born from humble beginnings; in 2013 Christopher Davenport, the founder of 4LESS, began selling auto parts on eBay and shipping those items out of his garage. But, what started out as a hobby, quickly grew into a fully functioning ecommerce aftermarket autoparts company that required a significant technical staff and facilities to support their growth. In June of 2015, they leased their first office.

Originally the company outsourced much of their operations to 3rd party companies to list their auto parts in the different marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, Walmart and Jet. However, using these 3rd party companies was inefficient, cumbersome, slow and very expensive.

Since 2016 the company has invested heavily to become their own listing platform that allows their auto parts to be direct listed across marketplace and social media sites. We have completed multiple technical achievements including CRM system, warehouse integration API, warehouse inventory software to name a few.

Mr. Davenport felt that consumers online buying habits have shifted away from “all things to all people” web sites to highly targeted niche web sites.

Today successful e-commerce companies have to be able to quickly respond to market forces, The 4LESS platform allows them to push their products in front of billions of potential buyers seamlessly and quickly. This includes marketing products not only through the largest online marketplaces in the world but also to the largest social media platforms in the world as well. Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Google all feature 4LESS auto parts.

Presently, 4LESS operates 3 branded websites: LiftKits4LESS.com, Bumpers4LESS.com and TruckBedCovers4LESS.com with plans to add more in the near future. In total, these sites represent products from over 1,000 manufacturers.

Competition

Our niche web sites are unique in the market place and currently we do not see any other competitors managing multiple web sites in the aftermarket auto parts. We directly compete for buyers to use our web sites over current e-commerce giants that we sell through such as Amazon and eBay. However, our web sites offer substantial value-added content including installation guides, install videos, high impact photos, order customization and live chat with a technical expert. We believe all these value-adds give our web sites significant advantages over large “all things to all people” online market places. While there are several other small ecommerce sellers in the marketplace, their sites do not offer the technical flexibility to sell across all marketplaces seamlessly. Presently we do not see them as a significant threat to market share.
