 Item 1. Business 
 The purpose of the Aberdeen Standard Precious Metals Basket ETF Trust (the “Trust”), formerly known as ETFS Precious Metals Basket Trust prior to October 1, 2018, is to own, in an agreed proportion, gold, silver, platinum and palladium (collectively, “Bullion”) transferred to the Trust in exchange for shares issued by the Trust (“Shares”). Each Share represents a fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust. The assets of the Trust are anticipated to consist solely of Bullion. The Trust was formed on October 18, 2010 when an initial deposit of Bullion was made in exchange for the issuance of two Baskets (a “Basket” consists of 50,000 Shares). 
 The sponsor of the Trust is Aberdeen Standard Investments ETFs Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”), formerly known as ETF Securities USA LLC prior to October 1, 2018. The trustee of the Trust is The Bank of New York Mellon (the “Trustee”) and the custodian is JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., London Branch (the “Custodian”). 
 The Trust’s Shares at redeemable value decreased from $361,931,979 at December 31, 2017 to $359,264,176 at December 31, 2018, the Trust’s fiscal year end. Outstanding Shares in the Trust increased from 5,600,000 Shares at December 31, 2017 to 5,700,000 Shares at December 31, 2018. 
 The Trust is not managed like a corporation or an active investment vehicle. The Trust has no directors, officers or employees. It does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from or to improve the losses caused by changes in the price of gold, silver, platinum and palladium. The Bullion held by the Trust will only be delivered to pay the remuneration due to the Sponsor (the “Sponsor’s Fee”), distributed to Authorized Participants (defined below) in connection with the redemption of Baskets or sold (1) on an as-needed basis to pay Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, (2) in the event the Trust terminates and liquidates its assets, or (3) as otherwise required by law or regulation. 
 The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required to register under such act. The Trust does not and will not hold or trade in commodities futures contracts, “commodity interests” or any other instruments regulated by the Commodity Exchange Act (the “CEA”), as administered by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”). The Trust is not a commodity pool for purposes of the CEA and the Shares are not “commodity interests,” and neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee is subject to regulation as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor in connection with the Shares. The Trust has no fixed termination date. 
 The Sponsor of the registrant maintains an Internet website at www.aberdeenstandardetfs.us, through which the registrant’s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, are made available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Additional information regarding the Trust may also be found on the SEC’s EDGAR database at www.sec.gov.

 Trust Objective 
 The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of physical gold, silver, platinum and palladium in the proportions held by the Trust, less the expenses of the Trust’s operations. The Trust holds Bullion in a ratio such that, for every 0.03 ounces of gold, it holds 1.1 ounces of silver, 0.004 ounces of platinum and 0.006 ounces of palladium. The Shares are intended to constitute a simple and cost-effective means of making an investment similar to an investment in physical Bullion. An investment in physical Bullion requires expensive and sometimes complicated arrangements in connection with the assay, transportation, warehousing and insurance of the metal. Traditionally, such expense and complications have resulted in investments in physical Bullion being efficient only in amounts beyond the reach of many investors. 
 The Shares are intended to provide institutional and retail investors with a simple and cost-efficient means, with minimal credit risk, of gaining investment benefits similar to those of holding physical Bullion. The Shares offer an investment that: 
 •Is Easily Accessible. The Shares trade on the NYSE Arca and provide institutional and retail investors with indirect access to the Bullion markets. The Shares are bought and sold on the NYSE Arca like any other exchange-listed securities. The close of the NYSE Arca trading session is 4:00 p.m. New York time. 
 •Is Relatively Cost Effective. The Sponsor expects that, for many investors, costs associated with buying and selling the Shares in the secondary market and the payment of the Trust’s ongoing expenses will be lower than the costs associated with buying and selling Bullion and storing and insuring Bullion in a traditional allocated Bullion account. 
 •Has Minimal Credit Risk. The Shares represent an interest in physical Bullion owned by the Trust (other than an amount held in unallocated form which is not sufficient to make up a whole bar or plate or ingot or which is held temporarily to effect a creation or redemption of Shares). Physical Bullion of the Trust in the Custodian’s possession is not subject to borrowing arrangements with third parties. Other than the Bullion temporarily being held in an unallocated Bullion account with the Custodian, the physical Bullion of the Trust is not subject to counterparty or credit risks. See “Risk Factors—Bullion held in the Trust’s unallocated Bullion account and any Authorized Participant’s unallocated Bullion account is not segregated from the Custodian’s assets....” This contrasts with most other financial products that gain exposure to Bullion through the use of derivatives that are subject to counterparty and credit risks. 
 Investing in the Shares does not insulate the investor from certain risks, including price volatility. See “Risk Factors.”

Overview of the Bullion Industry
 Introduction
 This section provides a brief introduction to the gold, silver, platinum and palladium industries by looking at some of the key participants, detailing the primary sources of demand and supply and, with respect to the gold and silver industries, outlining the role of the “official” sector (i.e., central banks) in the markets.
 In this annual report, the term “ounces” refers to fine troy ounces (with respect to gold only) and troy ounces (with respect to silver, platinum and palladium).
 The Gold Industry
 Market Participants
 The participants in the world gold market may be classified in the following sectors: the mining and producer sector, the banking sector, the official sector, the investment sector, and the manufacturing sector. A brief description of each follows. Mining and Producer Sector
 This group includes mining companies that specialize in gold and silver production, mining companies that produce gold as a by-product of other production (such as a copper or silver producer), scrap merchants and recyclers. Banking Sector
 Gold bullion banks provide a variety of services to the gold market and its participants, thereby facilitating interactions between other parties. Services provided by the gold bullion banking community include traditional banking products as well as mine financing, physical gold purchases and sales, hedging and risk management, inventory management for industrial users and consumers, and gold deposit and loan instruments. The Official Sector
 The official sector encompasses the activities of the various central banking operations of gold-holding countries. According to statistics released by the World Gold Council, central banks are estimated to hold approximately 33,000 tonnes (when used in this annual report “tonne” refers to one metric tonne, which is equivalent to 1,000 kilograms or 32,151 troy ounces) of gold reserves, or approximately 20% of existing above-ground stocks. Since September 2009, the European Central Bank and 18 other central banks have operated under the Central Bank Gold Agreement (“CBGA”). The CBGA maintains a cap on lending and derivatives activities and allows a maximum level of sales of 400 tonnes per year, with an overall total of no more than 2,000 tonnes permitted during the five-year life of the CBGA. The Investment Sector
 This sector includes the investment and trading activities of both professional & private investors and speculators. These participants range from large hedge and mutual funds to day-traders on futures exchanges, and retail-level coin collectors. The Manufacturing Sector
 The fabrication and manufacturing sector represents all the commercial and industrial users of gold for whom gold is a daily part of their business. The jewelry industry is a large user of gold. Other industrial users of gold include the electronics and dental industries.

  The following are some of the main characteristics of the gold market illustrated by the table:
 One factor which separates gold from other precious metals is that there are large above-ground stocks which can be quickly mobilized. As a result of gold’s liquidity, gold often acts more like a currency than a commodity. 
 Over the past ten years, (new) mine production of gold has experienced a modest rise of an average of 3.1% per annum. Of the three sources of supply, mine production accounts for 74% in 2017. Recycled gold volumes have ranged from 1,159  tonnes to 1,765 tonnes over the past 10 years. 
 On the demand side, jewelry is clearly the greatest source of demand. However, jewelry’s contribution to demand has fallen from 60% in 2008 to 53% of demand in 2017. Industrial demand has been relatively constant, contributing between 9% to 12% of total demand. Exchange traded product inventory build had seen strong growth until 2009, rising approximately three-fold between 2005 and 2009, followed by outflows in 2013, 2014 and 2015 as the price of gold fell by a cumulative 30% between 2013 and 2015. During the 2013 price crash, retail coin and bar demand rose to at a 10-year high as retail investors, especially from China, were enticed by the falling prices. Investor inflows into ETFs returned in 2016 amid heightened market uncertainty and continued to see 177 tonnes of inflows in 2017.

 Historical Chart of the Price of Gold
 The price of gold is volatile and fluctuations are expected to have a direct impact on the value of the Shares. However, movements in the price of gold in the past are not a reliable indicator of future movements. Movements may be influenced by various factors, including announcements from central banks regarding a country’s reserve gold holdings, agreements among central banks, political uncertainties around the world, and economic concerns.
 The following chart illustrates the movements in the price of an ounce of gold in U.S. Dollars from December 2008 to December 2018:

 The gold price tends to rise during periods of low real interest rates and high monetary expansion, as they are often associated with currency debasement and systemic financial failures. The decline in the U.S. Dollar against other currencies, a surge in investment demand in commodities as an asset class generally, and the low level of forward selling by mining companies have all contributed to the increase in the gold price between 2004 and 2011. The gold price peaked at US$1,900 per ounce in September 2011 as successive Euro leader summits, bailouts and bond stability funds failed to staunch both sovereign debt and banking sector solvency concerns in Europe. 2016 proved to be a stellar year for gold rising 8.4%, ending 3 years of negative price returns. Additionally, the trends of 3 years of investor outflows in global ETFs and net negative investor sentiment in gold futures positioning reversed in 2016 and continued through 2017. Low real interest rates, tepid economic growth, and rising policy uncertainty were key tailwinds for gold that sparked a return of investor interest. After rising 13.1% in 2017, gold prices fell 1.6% in 2018, closing at $1,282.45 per troy ounce.

 The Silver Industry
 Market Participants.
 The participants in the world silver market may be classified in the following sectors: the mining and producer sector, the banking sector, the official sector, the investment sector, and the manufacturing sector. A brief description of each follows. Mining and Producer Sector.
 This group includes mining companies that specialize in silver and silver production, mining companies that produce silver as a by-product of other production (such as a copper or gold producer), scrap merchants and recyclers. Banking Sector.
 Bullion banks provide a variety of services to the silver market and its participants, thereby facilitating interactions between other parties. Services provided by the bullion banking community include traditional banking products as well as mine financing, physical silver purchases and sales, hedging and risk management, inventory management for industrial users and consumers and silver leasing. The Official Sector.
 There are no official statistics published by the International Monetary Fund, Bank of International Settlements, or national banks on silver holdings by national governments. The main reason for this is that silver is generally not recognized as a reserve asset. Consequently, there are very limited silver stocks held by governments. According to GFMS Limited in World Silver Survey 2018, at the end of 2017, government-held silver bullion stocks total 89.1 million ounces. The Investment Sector.
 This sector includes the investment and trading activities of both professional and private investors and speculators. These participants range from large hedge and mutual funds to day-traders on futures exchanges, and retail-level coin collectors. The Manufacturing Sector.
 The fabrication and manufacturing sector represents all the commercial and industrial users of silver. Industrial applications comprise the largest use of silver. The jewelry and silverware sector is the second largest, followed by the photographic industry (although the latter has been declining over a number of years as a result of the spread of digital photography).

  The following are some of the main characteristics of the silver market illustrated by the table.
 Like gold, silver has also been used as a currency in the past. However, the main difference between gold and silver is that while approximately half of gold demand is used for jewelry, approximately half of silver fabrication demand is used for industrial applications.
 New mine production accounts for approximately 86% of total silver supply. Recycled silver accounts for around 14% of total supply. Recycled silver totaled 4,296 tons in 2017, marking the sixth consecutive year of reduced recycling supply. The total of producer hedging, government sales and implied “net disinvestment” has been in decline but together account for the balance of total supply.
 Industrial applications and jewelry demand accounted for over 79% of total demand in 2017. Photography has been taking a lower share of overall silver demand falling from 8% in 2008 to 4% in 2017, while photovoltaic demand has risen in recent years accounting for 9% in 2017. Investment in coins and bars has amounted to 15% of demand in 2017.

 Historical chart of the price of Silver
 The price of silver is volatile and fluctuations are expected to have a direct impact on the value of the Shares. However, movements in the price of silver in the past are not a reliable indicator of future movements. Movements may be influenced by various factors, including announcements from central banks regarding a country’s reserve silver holdings, agreements among central banks, political uncertainties around the world, and economic concerns. The following chart illustrates the movements in the price of an ounce of silver in dollars from December 2008 to December 2018 and is based on information provided by Bloomberg:

 Between 2003 and 2011, the price of silver increased due to a number of factors. Among such factors are the decline in the U.S. Dollar against other currencies, a surge in investment demand in commodities as an asset class generally, strength in fabrication demand, and the low level of forward selling by mining companies. Since the global financial crisis that started in 2008, investors have increasingly been using silver as a store of value to counter the effects of an increase in paper money by major reserve currency central banks. However, since 2011, when prices peaked at $48.44 per ounce, prices have trended downwards, albeit with multiple upwards rallies (that have often lasted several months). The rise in the value of the U.S. Dollar, sluggish industrial growth and a tame inflation environment (which has led some investors to revise their expectations of the effects of monetary expansion) are some of the drivers behind the fall in silver prices since 2011.  In 2018 silver prices fell 8.5%, closing at $15.47 per ounce, driven by a stronger dollar and concerns of a global slowdown impacting industrial demand.
 Platinum Group Metals
 Platinum and palladium are the two best known metals of the six platinum group metals (“PGMs”). Platinum and palladium have the greatest economic importance and are found in the largest quantities. The other four—iridium, rhodium, ruthenium and osmium—are produced only as co-products of platinum and palladium.
 PGMs are found primarily in South Africa and Russia. South Africa is the world’s leading platinum producer and one of the largest palladium producers. Russia is the largest producer of palladium and most production is concentrated in the Norilsk region. All of South Africa’s production is sourced from the Bushveld Igneous Complex, which hosts the world’s largest resource of PGMs. Together, South Africa and Russia accounted for nearly 81% of platinum and palladium mine supply in 2017.

  The following are some of the main characteristics of the platinum market illustrated by the table:
 The main supplier of platinum is South Africa, providing over 70% of total mine supply in 2017. Russia is the second largest supplier of platinum. Its share of world mine production has averaged around 12% of total mine supply over the past ten years. Scrap supply from recycling of autocatalyst and other sources have accounted for about 24% from 2013 to 2017, on average.
 Over the past decade, jewelry demand for platinum peaked at 41% of total demand in 2009. Jewelry demand has since declined to 29% of total demand in 2017, down from 30% the year prior. Autocatalyst demand for platinum accounted for around 42% of total demand at the end of 2017. Investment demand accounted for 4% of the total in 2017, down significantly from the prior two years.

 Historical Chart of the Price of Platinum
 The price of platinum is volatile and fluctuations are expected to have a direct impact on the value of the Shares. However, movements in the price of platinum in the past are not a reliable indicator of future movements.
 The following chart illustrates the movements in the price of an ounce of platinum in U.S. Dollars from December 2008 to December 2018 and is based on information provided by Bloomberg.

 ﻿
 In the second half of 2008 platinum prices fell sharply (from a high of $2,276 per ounce in March to a low of $814 per ounce at the end of October 2008) as industrial demand collapsed on the back of the global financial crisis. Prices remained weak in the first few months of 2009 as industrial activity continued to slow. As global manufacturing started to turn up in early 2009, platinum prices began to rise. During this period, the prices of a wide range of commodities, equities and other cyclically-oriented assets also began to rebound strongly from the lows of late 2008/early 2009. As it became clear that auto sales in the US and China were rebounding on a sustainable basis, platinum continued to rise. By the end of 2009, platinum prices had risen to $1,416 per ounce, representing a 63% increase from the beginning of 2009 and 64% of the March 2008 high. The Japanese earthquake in early 2011, coupled with the unfolding of the European financial crisis with Portugal being bailed out, weighed on platinum performance in the second half of 2011. Platinum prices dropped by 26% in the six months to December 2011, from a high of $1,840 per troy ounce in June to a low of $1,369 per troy ounce in December 2011. Continued weakness in the European auto market weighed on platinum performance since then, with prices only partially recovering from 2011 lows. In 2012, platinum prices rose on the back of supply disruptions in South Africa, which accounts for over 80% of world’s supply of platinum.  A strike at one of South Africa’s biggest platinum mines caused the price of platinum to rise from $1,387 to $1,709 per ounce in August 2012. At the beginning of 2013, Anglo American Platinum, the world’s biggest producer of the metal, announced its intention to close four mine shafts and its consideration of selling another mine complex as part of a radical overhaul of its South African operations. This statement prompted a strong reaction on platinum prices, which rose from $1,656 to $1,736 per ounce in the days following the announcement, on fears of a further tightening in platinum supply.  However, platinum’s correlation to gold weighed on platinum prices in 2013 overall. Prolonged strikes at South African mines in 2014 led to the deepest supply deficit in platinum since 1975 (the earliest date we have supply and demand data). However, that failed to arrest the price slide which saw prices fall 11% in 2014, highlighting the extent of negative sentiment towards industrially-exposed precious metals. Despite autocatalyst demand for platinum increasing in 2015, tightening nitrogen oxide emission standards have led to pessimism about the future demand for platinum-heavy diesel autocatalysts relative to palladium-heavy gasoline autocatalysts. Further pessimistic outlook for South Africa’s economy and its currency the South African Rand weighed on platinum prices throughout 2017. Platinum fell 14.5% in 2018 driven by lackluster investor sentiment, a stronger US dollar, weaker diesel demand and rising mine supply.

  The following are some of the main characteristics of the palladium market illustrated by the table:
 Russia has traditionally been the largest producer of palladium, providing on average 46% of supply over the past 10 years.  However its production has declined and sales of state held stock has dwindled down to zero.  In 2017, Russia provided 40% of mine supplies while South Africa produced 38%.  South Africa has on average supplied over 35% of production over the past 10 years.  North America contributes approximately 13% of mine supply. Autocatalysts are the largest component of palladium demand, representing close to 78% of total demand in 2017. Palladium investment demand remains a very small part of the market with only 53,000 ounces of demand from retail investment in 2017. Jewelry demand for palladium contributed 3% of total demand in 2017, up from 2% in 2016. Other industrial demand (electronics, dentistry and chemical) has fallen from 28% of total demand in 2009 to 21% of total demand in 2017.

 Historical Chart of the Price of Palladium 
 The price of palladium is volatile and fluctuations are expected to have a direct impact on the value of the Shares. However, movements in the price of palladium in the past are not a reliable indicator of future movements. The following chart illustrates the movements in the price of an ounce of palladium in U.S. Dollars from December 2008 to December 2018 and is based on information provided by Bloomberg: 

 Palladium prices fell sharply during the first phase of the global financial crisis, when prices dropped from $579 per ounce in February 2008 to $173 per ounce in October 2008. Prices then rallied almost five-fold until February 2011 to $841/oz, in line with other precious metals that gained favor as investors sought to diversify their assets away from paper currencies that they felt were being debased. Adding to demand for palladium, a number of countries had car scrappage programs, as part of their expenditure programs to counter the recession and to encourage people to replace their old vehicles with newer more environmentally-friendly ones. The rise in Chinese demand for cars and autocatalysts has also provided support for palladium demand in addition to increasing emission controls. Palladium prices have tempered since 2011, but concerns over supply shortages due to labor problems at mines in South Africa and dwindling Russian stocks have provided some price support since mid-2012. Palladium rose to a 13 year high of $907 per ounce in September 2014, a 27% increase from the start of the year. The rally was driven by supply side concerns following the longest strike in South African mining history and escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine. The strong rally in 2014 was completely unwound in 2015, when South African mine supply resumed back to pre-strike levels and pessimism about industrial demand in China overwhelmed the true tightness in the market. Palladium was the top performer of the precious metals complex for 3 consecutive years from 2016 to 2018, where it rose nearly 125% from $563 per troy ounce on December 31, 2015 to $1,261.75 per troy ounce on December 31, 2018. Given palladium’s demand is most sensitive to the industrial production cycle palladium may see further support along with industrial metals in anticipation of a rise in US infrastructure spending and recovery in global growth. Expected continued supply deficits, growing demand, and drawdowns in above ground stocks have kept the market balance for palladium favorable.

Operation of the Bullion Markets
 The global trade in Bullion consists of Over-the-Counter (“OTC”) transactions in spot, forwards, and options and other derivatives, together with exchange-traded futures and options. 
 Global Over-The-Counter Market
 The OTC market trades on a 24-hour per day continuous basis and accounts for most global Bullion trading.
 Market makers, as well as others in the OTC market, trade with each other and with their clients on a principal-to-principal basis. All risks and issues of credit are between the parties directly involved in the transaction.
 For gold and silver, market makers include the market-making members of the London Bullion Market Association (“LBMA”), the trade association that acts as the coordinator for activities conducted on behalf of its members and other participants in the London bullion market. The thirteen market-making members of the LBMA are: BNP Paribas SA, Citibank N.A. (through its London Branch), HSBC Bank USA, N.A. (London Branch), Goldman Sachs International, ICBC Standard Bank, JPMorgan Chase Bank, The Bank of Nova Scotia-ScotiaMocatta, Société Générale, Merrill Lynch International Bank Limited, Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc, Standard Chartered Bank, Toronto-Dominion Bank and UBS AG.
 For platinum and palladium, eight market-making members of the London Platinum and Palladium Market (“LPPM”), the trade association that acts as the coordinator for activities conducted on behalf of its members and other participants in the LPPM, are currently participating in the London Metal Exchange Fix (“LME Fix”). The OTC market provides a relatively flexible market in terms of quotes, price, size, destinations for delivery and other factors. Bullion dealers customize transactions to meet clients’ requirements. The OTC market has no formal structure and no open-outcry meeting place.
 The main centers of the OTC market are London, Zurich and New York for gold and silver and London, New York, Hong Kong and Zurich for platinum and palladium. Mining companies, central banks, manufacturers of jewelry and industrial products, together with investors and speculators, tend to transact their business through one of these market centers. Centers such as Dubai and several cities in the Far East also transact substantial OTC market business, typically involving jewelry and small bars of gold or silver and small plates or ingots of platinum or palladium (1 kilogram or less) and will hedge their exposure by selling into one of these main OTC centers. Precious metals dealers have offices around the world and most of the world’s major bullion dealers are either members or associate members of the LBMA and/or the LPPM.
 In the OTC market for gold, the standard size of trades between market makers ranges between 5,000 and 10,000 ounces. Bid-offer spreads are typically 50 US cents per ounce. Certain dealers are willing to offer clients competitive prices for much larger volumes, including trades over 100,000 ounces, although this will vary according to the dealer, the client and market conditions, as transaction costs in the OTC market are negotiable between the parties and therefore vary widely. Cost indicators can be obtained from various information service providers as well as dealers.
 In the OTC market for silver, the standard size of trades between market makers is 100,000 ounces.
 In the OTC market for platinum and palladium, the standard size of trades between market makers is 1,000 ounces.
 Liquidity in the OTC market can vary from time to time during the course of the 24-hour trading day. Fluctuations in liquidity are reflected in adjustments to dealing spreads—the differential between a dealer’s “buy” and “sell” prices. The period of greatest liquidity in the Bullion markets generally occurs at the time of day when trading in the European time zones overlaps with trading in the United States, which is when OTC market trading in London, New York, Zurich and other centers coincides with futures and options trading on the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (“COMEX”), a designated contract market within the CME Group. This period lasts for approximately four hours each New York business day morning.

 The Gold Bullion Market
 The London Gold Bullion Market
 Although the market for physical gold is distributed globally, most OTC market trades are cleared through London. In addition to coordinating market activities, the LBMA acts as the principal point of contact between the market and its regulators. A primary function of the LBMA is its involvement in the promotion of refining standards by maintenance of the “London Good Delivery Lists,” which are the lists of LBMA accredited melters and assayers of gold. The LBMA also coordinates market clearing and vaulting, promotes good trading practices and develops standard documentation.
 The terms “loco London” gold and “loco Zurich” gold refer to gold physically held in London and Zurich, respectively, that meets the specifications for weight, dimensions, fineness (or purity), identifying marks (including the assay stamp of a LBMA acceptable refiner) and appearance set forth in “The Good Delivery Rules for Gold and Silver Bars” published by the LBMA. Gold bars meeting these requirements are described in this prospectus from time to time as “London Good Delivery Bars.” The unit of trade in London is the troy ounce, whose gram conversion is: 1,000 grams equals 32.1507465 troy ounces and 1 troy ounce equals 31.1034768 grams. A London Good Delivery bar is acceptable for delivery in settlement of a transaction on the OTC market. Typically referred to as 400-ounce bars, a London Good Delivery bar must contain between 350 and 430 fine troy ounces of gold, with a minimum fineness (or purity) of 995 parts per 1,000 (99.5%), be of good appearance and be easy to handle and stack. The fine gold content of a gold bar is calculated by multiplying the gross weight of the bar (expressed in units of 0.025 troy ounces) by the fineness of the bar. A London Good Delivery bar must also bear the stamp of one of the melters and assayers who are on the LBMA approved list. Unless otherwise specified, the gold spot price always refers to that of a London Good Delivery bar. Business is generally conducted over the phone and through electronic dealing systems.
 On March 20, 2015, ICE Benchmark Administration (“IBA”) began administering the operation of an “equilibrium auction,” which is an electronic, tradable and auditable, over-the-counter auction market with the ability to settle trades in US Dollars (“USD”), Euros or British Pounds for LBMA-authorized participating gold bullion banks or market makers (“gold participants”) that establishes a reference gold price for that day’s trading. IBA’s equilibrium auction is the gold valuation replacement selected by the LBMA for the London gold fix previously determined by the London Gold Market Fixing Ltd. that was discontinued on March 19, 2015. IBA’s equilibrium auction, like the previous gold fixing process, establishes and publishes fixed prices for troy ounces of gold twice each London trading day during fixing sessions beginning at 10:30 a.m. London time (the “LBMA AM Gold Price”) and 3:00 p.m. London time (the “LBMA PM Gold Price”).  
 Daily during London trading hours the LBMA AM Gold Price and the LBMA PM Gold Price each provide reference gold prices for that day’s trading. Many long-term contracts will be priced on either the basis of the LBMA AM Gold Price or the LBMA PM Gold Price, and market participants will usually refer to one or the other of these prices when looking for a basis for valuations. The LBMA AM Gold Price and the LBMA PM Gold Price, determined according to the methodologies of IBA and disseminated electronically by IBA to selected major market data vendors, such as Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg, are widely used benchmarks for daily gold prices and are quoted by various financial information sources as the London gold fix was previously. The Trust values its gold on the basis of the LBMA PM Gold Price.
 The LBMA PM Gold Price is the result of an “equilibrium auction” because it establishes a price for a troy ounce of gold that clears the maximum amount of bids and offers for gold entered by order-submitting gold participants each day. The opening bid and subsequent bid prices are generated by an algorithm based method, and each auction is actively supervised by IBA staff.  There are currently 13 direct gold participants (Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Goldman Sachs, HSBC Bank USA NA, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), INTL FCStone, Jane Street Global Trading, LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. London Branch, Koch Supply and Trading LP, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered Bank, The Bank of Nova Scotia–ScotiaMocatta, and Toronto-Dominion Bank), and IBA uses ICE’s front-end system, WebICE, as the technology platform that allows direct participants as well as sponsored clients to manage their orders in the auction in real time via their own screens. 
 The IBA auction process begins with a notice of an auction round issued to gold participants before the commencement of the auction round stating a gold price in U.S. Dollars, at which the auction round will be conducted. An auction round lasts 30 seconds. Gold participants electronically place bid and offer orders at the round’s stated price and indicate whether the orders are for their own account or for the account of clients. Aggregate bid and offer volume will be shown live on WebICE, providing a level playing field for all participants.   

 
14

      
 At the end of the auction round, the IBA system evaluates the equilibrium of the bid and offer orders submitted. If bid and offer orders indicate an imbalance outside of acceptable tolerances established for the IBA system (normally 10,000 oz) (e.g., too many purchase orders submitted compared to sell orders or vice versa), the auction chairman calculates a new auction round price principally based on the volume weighting of bid and offer orders submitted in the immediately completed auction round. For instance, if the order imbalance indicates that purchase orders (bids) outweigh sales orders (offers) then a new auction round price will be issued that will be increased over that used in the prior auction round. Likewise, the new auction round price will be decreased from the prior round’s price if offers outweigh bids. To clear the imbalance, the IBA system then issues another notice of auction round to gold participants at the newly calculated price. During this next 30 second auction round, gold participants again submit orders, and after it ends, the IBA system evaluates for order imbalances. If order imbalances persist, a new auction price is calculated and a further auction round will occur. This auction round process continues until an equilibrium within specified tolerances is determined to exist. Once the IBA system determines that orders are in equilibrium within system tolerances, the auction process ends and the equilibrium auction round price becomes the LBMA PM Gold Price. 
 The LBMA PM Gold Price and all bid and offer order information for all auction rounds become publicly available electronically via IBA instantly after the conclusion of the equilibrium auction. Since April 1, 2015, the LBMA Gold Price has been regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) in the United Kingdom (“UK”). IBA also has an Oversight Committee, made up of market participants, industry bodies, direct participant representatives, infrastructure providers and IBA. The Oversight Committee allows the LBMA to continue to have significant involvement in the oversight of the auction process, including, among other matters, changes to the methodology and accreditation of direct participants. Additionally, IBA watches over the price discovery process for the LBMA Gold Price and ensures that it meets the International Organization of Securities Commission’s (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks.
 The LBMA PM Gold Price is widely viewed as a full and fair representation of all or material market interest at the conclusion of the equilibrium auction. IBA’s LBMA PM Gold Price electronic auction methodology is similar to the non-electronic process previously used to establish the London gold fix where the London gold fix process adjusted the gold price up or down until all the buy and sell orders are matched, at which time the price was declared fixed. Nevertheless, the LBMA PM Gold Price has several advantages over the previous London gold fix. The LBMA PM Gold Price auction process is fully transparent in real time to the gold participants and, at the close of each equilibrium auction, to the general public.
 The LBMA PM Gold Price auction process is also fully auditable by third parties since an audit trail exists from the time of each notice of an auction round. Moreover, the LBMA PM Gold Price’s audit trail and active, real time surveillance of the auction process by IBA as well as FCA’s oversight of IBA, will deter manipulative and abusive conduct in establishing each day’s LBMA PM Gold Price.
 Since March 20, 2015, the Sponsor determined that the London gold fix, which ceased to be published as of March 19, 2015, could no longer serve as a basis for valuing gold bullion received upon purchase of the Trust’s Shares, delivered upon redemption of the Trust’s Shares and otherwise held by the Trust on a daily basis, and that the LBMA PM Gold Price is an appropriate alternative for determining the value of the Trust’s gold each trading day.  The Sponsor also determined that the LBMA PM Gold Price will fairly represent the commercial value of gold bullion held by the Trust and the “Benchmark Price” (as defined in Trust Agreement) as of any day will be the LBMA PM Gold Price for such day.
 The Zurich Bullion Market
 After London, the second principal center for spot or physical gold trading is Zurich. For eight hours a day, trading occurs simultaneously in London and Zurich—with Zurich normally opening and closing an hour earlier than London. During these hours, Zurich closely rivals London in its influence over the spot price because of the importance of the three major Swiss banks—Credit Suisse, Swiss Bank Corporation, and Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS)—in the physical gold market. Each of these banks has long maintained its own refinery, often taking physical delivery of gold and processing it for other regional markets. The loco Zurich bullion specification is the same as for the London bullion market, which allows for gold physically located in Zurich to be quoted loco London and vice versa. Futures Exchanges
 The most significant gold futures exchanges are the COMEX and the Tokyo Commodity Exchange (“TOCOM”). The COMEX is the largest exchange in the world for trading precious metals futures and options and has been trading gold since 1974. The TOCOM has been trading gold since 1982. Trading on these exchanges is based on fixed delivery dates and transaction sizes for the futures and options contracts traded. Trading costs are negotiable. As a matter of practice, only a small percentage of the futures market turnover ever comes to physical delivery of the gold represented by the contracts traded. Both exchanges permit trading on margin. Margin trading can add to the speculative risk involved given the potential for margin calls if the price moves against the contract holder. The COMEX trades gold futures almost continuously (with one short break in the evening) through its CME Globex electronic trading system and clears through its central clearing system. On June 6, 2003, TOCOM adopted a similar clearing system. In each case, the exchange acts as a counterparty for each member for clearing purposes.


 
15

      Other Exchanges
 There are other gold exchange markets, such as the Istanbul Gold Exchange (trading gold since 1995), the Shanghai Gold Exchange (trading gold since 2002), the Hong Kong Chinese Gold & Silver Exchange Society (trading gold since 1918) and the Singapore Mercantile Exchange (trading gold since 2010). The Silver Market
 The London Silver Bullion Market
 Although the market for physical silver is distributed globally, most OTC market trades are cleared through London. In addition to coordinating market activities, the LBMA acts as the principal point of contact between the market and its regulators. A primary function of the LBMA is its involvement in the promotion of refining standards by maintenance of the “London Good Delivery Lists,” which are the lists of LBMA accredited melters and assayers of silver. The LBMA also coordinates market clearing and vaulting, promotes good trading practices and develops standard documentation.
 The term “loco London” silver refers to silver physically held in London that meets the specifications for weight, dimensions, fineness (or purity), identifying marks (including the assay stamp of a LBMA acceptable refiner) and appearance set forth in “The Good Delivery Rules for Gold and Silver Bars” published by the LBMA. Silver bars meeting these requirements are described in this prospectus from time to time as “Silver Good Delivery Bars.” The unit of trade in London is the troy ounce, whose conversion between grams is: 1,000 grams equals 32.1507465 troy ounces and 1 troy ounce equals 31.1034768 grams. A Silver Good Delivery Bar is acceptable for delivery in settlement of a transaction on the OTC market. A Silver Good Delivery Bar must contain between 750 troy ounces and 1,100 troy ounces of silver with a minimum fineness (or purity) of 999.0 parts per 1,000. A Silver Good Delivery Bar must also bear the stamp of one of the refiners who are on the LBMA-approved list. Unless otherwise specified, the silver spot price always refers to that of a Silver Good Delivery Bar. Business is generally conducted over the phone and through electronic dealing systems.
 On July 14, 2017, the LBMA announced that ICE Benchmark Administration (“IBA”) had been selected to be the third-party administrator for the “LBMA Silver Price”. Effective from October 2, 2017, IBA is providing the auction platform and methodology as well as the overall administration and governance for the LBMA Silver Price benchmark. IBA operates an “equilibrium auction”, which is an electronic, tradable and auditable, over-the-counter auction for LBMA-authorized participating silver bullion banks or market makers and sponsored clients of direct participants (“silver participants”) that establishes a reference silver price for that day’s trading, often referred to as the “LBMA Silver Price”. The LBMA Silver Price equilibrium auction operated by CME Group Inc. and Thomson Reuters prior to October 2, 2017 was selected by the LBMA as the silver valuation replacement for the London silver fix previously determined by the London Silver Market Fixing Ltd. that was discontinued on August 14, 2014. The LBMA Silver Price has become a widely used benchmark for daily silver prices and is quoted by various financial information sources as the London silver fix was previously.
 The LBMA Silver Price is the result of an “equilibrium auction” because it establishes a price for a troy ounce of Silver Good Delivery Bars that clears the maximum amount of bids and offers for silver entered by order-submitting silver participants each day. IBA uses ICE’s front-end system, WebICE, as the technology platform that allows direct participants, as well as sponsored clients of direct participants, to manage their orders in the auction in real time via their own desktops. As the IBA electronic silver auction market develops, IBA expects to admit additional silver participants to the order submission process. The benchmark is published when the auction finishes, typically a few minutes after 12:00 noon (London time). 
 At the opening of each auction, IBA in the role of auction chairman (“Chairman”) announces an opening price (in U.S. Dollars), that takes into account current market conditions and begins auction rounds, with an expected duration of at least 30 seconds each. During each auction round, participants may enter the volume they wish to buy or sell at that price, and such orders will be part of the price formation. Aggregate bid and offer volume is shown live on WebICE. At the end of each auction round, the total net volume is calculated. If this “imbalance” is larger than the imbalance tolerance (normally 500,000 oz.) then the Chairman sets a new price (based on the current market conditions, and the direction and magnitude of the imbalance in the round) and begins a new auction round. If the imbalance is less than the tolerance, then the auction is complete with all volume tradeable at that price. The price is then set in U.S. Dollars and also converted into other currencies, including Australian Dollars, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, Onshore and Offshore Yuan, Indian Rupees, Japanese Yen, Malaysian Ringgit, Russian Rubles, Singapore Dollars, South African Rand, Swiss Francs, New Taiwan Dollars, Thai Baht and Turkish Lira. The auction is run at 12:00 noon (London time).
 During the auction, the price at the start of each round, and the volumes at the end of each round are available through major market data vendors. As soon as the auction finishes, the final prices and volumes are available through major market data vendors. IBA also publishes transparency reports, detailing the prices, volumes and times for each round of the auction. These transparency reports are available through major market data vendors and IBA when the auction finishes. The process can also be observed real-time through a WebICE screen. The auction mechanism provides a complete audit trail.    ﻿

      As of August 1, 2017, there were seven direct participants in the LBMA Silver Price administered by CME Group and Thomson Reuters. As of February 11, 2019, there are 10 direct participants participating in the auction process that determines the LBMA Silver Price.
 Since April 1, 2015, the LBMA Silver Price has been regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) in the United Kingdom (“UK”).  IBA is authorized as a regulated benchmark administrator by the FCA. Under the UK benchmark regulation, the governance structure for a regulated benchmark must include an Oversight Committee, made up of market participants, industry bodies, direct participant representatives, infrastructure providers and the administrator (i.e., IBA). Through the Oversight Committee the LBMA continues to have significant involvement in the oversight of the auction process, including, among other matters, changes to the methodology and accreditation of direct participants. The price discovery process for the LBMA Silver Price is subject to surveillance by IBA. IBA has been formally assessed against the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks (the “IOSCO Principles”). In order to meet the IOSCO Principles, the price discovery used for the LBMA Silver Price benchmark is auditable and transparent. 
 The LBMA Silver Price is viewed as a full and fair representation of all market interest at the conclusion of the auction. IBA’s auction process is similar to CME Group’s auction process, which in turn was similar to the non-electronic process previously used to establish the London silver fix where the London silver fix process adjusted the silver price up or down until all the buy and sell orders are matched, at which time the price was declared fixed. Nevertheless, the LBMA Silver Price has several advantages over the previous London silver fix. IBA’s auction process is fully transparent in real-time to direct participants and sponsored clients and, at the close of each auction, to the general public. IBA’s auction process is also fully auditable since an audit trail exists for every change made in the process. Moreover, the audit trail and active surveillance of the auction process by IBA, as well as the FCA’s oversight of IBA, will deter manipulative and abusive conduct in establishing each day’s LBMA Silver Price.
 Since August 15, 2014, the Sponsor determined that the London silver fix, which ceased to be published as of that date, would be an inappropriate basis for valuing silver bullion received upon purchase of the Trust’s Shares, delivered upon redemption of the Trust’s Shares and otherwise held by the Trust on a daily basis, and that the LBMA Silver Price is an appropriate alternative for determining the value of the Trust’s silver each trading day.  The Sponsor also determined that the LBMA Silver Price will fairly represent the commercial value of silver bullion held by the Trust and that the “Benchmark Price” (as defined in the Trust Agreement) as of any day will be the LBMA Silver Price for such day.
 Futures Exchanges
 The most significant silver futures exchanges are the COMEX and the TOCOM. Futures exchanges seek to provide a neutral, regulated marketplace for the trading of derivatives contracts for commodities. Futures contracts are defined by the exchange for each commodity. For each commodity traded, this contract specifies the precise quality and quantity standards. The contract’s terms and conditions also define the location and timing of physical delivery.
 An exchange does not buy or sell those contracts, but seeks to offer a transparent forum where members, on their own behalf or on the behalf of customers, can trade the contracts in a safe, efficient and orderly manner. During regular trading hours at the COMEX, the commodity contracts are traded on CME Globex system, an electronic; a verbal auction in which all bids, offers and trades must be publicly announced to all members and, upon execution, centrally cleared. Electronic trading is offered by the exchange almost 24 hours a day (except for a short break in the evening), six days a week.
 In addition to the public nature of the pricing, futures exchanges in the United States are regulated at two levels: internal and external governmental supervision. The internal is performed through self-regulation and consists of regular monitoring of the following: the central algorithmic matching process to ensure that it is conducted in conformance with all exchange rules; the orderly trading and settlement of futures and options; the financial condition of all exchange member firms to ensure that they continuously meet financial commitments; and the volume positions of commercial and non-commercial customers to ensure that physical delivery and other commercial commitments can be met, and that pricing is not being improperly affected by the size of any particular customer positions. External governmental oversight is performed by the CFTC, which reviews all the rules and regulations of United States futures exchanges and clearing houses and monitors their enforcement.
 The Platinum Market
 The Zurich and London Platinum Bullion Market
 Although the market for physical platinum is distributed globally, most platinum is stored and most OTC market trades are cleared through Zurich. As of September 1, 2009, London also serves as a center for the clearing of OTC trades in platinum. In addition to coordinating market activities, the LPPM acts as the principal point of contact between the market and its regulators. A primary function of the LPPM is its involvement in the promotion of refining standards by maintenance of the “London/Zurich Good Delivery Lists,” which are the lists of LPPM accredited melters and assayers of platinum. The LPPM also coordinates market clearing and vaulting, promotes good trading practices and develops standard documentation.

 Platinum is traded generally on a “loco Zurich” basis, meaning the precious metal is physically held in vaults in Zurich or is transferred into accounts established in Zurich. As of September 1, 2009, platinum began trading on a “loco London” basis as well, meaning the precious metal is physically held in vaults in London or is transferred into accounts established in London. The basis for settlement and delivery of a loco Zurich spot trade is payment (generally in U.S. Dollars) two business days after the trade date against delivery. Delivery of the platinum can either be by physical delivery or through the clearing systems to an unallocated account.
 The unit of trade in London and Zurich is the troy ounce, whose conversion between grams is: 1,000 grams is equivalent to 32.1507465 troy ounces, and one troy ounce is equivalent to 31.1034768 grams. A good delivery platinum plate or ingot is acceptable for delivery in settlement of a transaction on the OTC market (a “Good Delivery Platinum Plate or Ingot”). A Good Delivery Platinum Plate or Ingot must contain between 32 and 192 troy ounces of platinum with a minimum fineness (or purity) of 999.5 parts per 1,000 (99.95%), be of good appearance, and be easy to handle and stack. The platinum content of a platinum Good Delivery Platinum Plate or Ingot is calculated by multiplying the gross weight by the fineness of the plate or ingot. A Good Delivery Platinum Plate or Ingot must also bear the stamp of one of the melters and assayers who are on the LPPM approved list. Unless otherwise specified, the platinum spot price always refers to the “Good Delivery Standards” set by the LPPM. Business is generally conducted over the phone and through electronic dealing systems.
 Since December 1, 2014, the LME has been administering the operation of an electronic platinum bullion price fixing systems (“LMEbullion”) that replicates electronically the manual London platinum fix processes previously employed by the London Platinum and Palladium Fixing Company Ltd (“LPPFCL”), as well as providing electronic market clearing processes for platinum bullion transactions at the fixed prices established by the LME pricing mechanism. The LME’s electronic price fixing processes, like the previous London platinum fix processes, establishes and publishes fixed prices for troy ounces of platinum twice each London trading day during fixing sessions beginning at 9:45 a.m. London time (the “LME AM Fix”) and 2:00 p.m. London time (the “LME PM Fix”). In addition to utilizing the same London platinum fix standards and methods, the LME also supervises the platinum electronic price fixing processes through its market operations, compliance, internal audit and third-party complaint handling capabilities in order to support the integrity of the LME PM Fix. The LME, in administering LMEbullion, uses a pricing methodology that meets the administrative and regulatory needs of platinum market participants, including the International Organization of Securities Commissions’ (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks.
 Daily during London trading hours the LME AM Fix and the LME PM Fix each provide reference platinum prices for that day’s trading. Many long-term contracts are priced on the basis of either the LME AM Fix or the LME PM Fix, and market participants will usually refer to one or the other of these prices when looking for a basis for valuations. The Trust values its platinum on the basis of the LME PM Fix.
 The LME PM Fix results from LMEbullion.  Formal participation in the LME PM Fix is limited to participating LPPM members. Five LPPM member participants are currently participating in establishing the LME PM Fix (Goldman Sachs International, HSBC Bank USA NA, ICBC Standard Bank plc, Johnson Matthey plc and BASF Metals Ltd.). Any other market participant wishing to participate in the trading on the LME PM Fix is required to do so through one of the participating LPPM members..

 Orders are placed either with one of the participating LPPM member participants or with another precious metals dealer who will then be in contact with a participating LPPM member during the fixing. The fix begins with the chair of the pricing function submitting an opening price into the administration screen in LMEbullion, reflecting the market price and other data, prevailing at the opening of the fix. This is relayed by the LPPM member participants to their dealing rooms which have direct communication with all interested parties. Any member participant may enter the fixing process at any time, or adjust or withdraw his order. The platinum price is adjusted up or down until all the buy and sell orders are electronically matched, at which time the price is declared fixed. All orders are transacted on the basis of this fixed price, which is instantly relayed to the market through various media.
 The LBMA and the LME have asserted that the LME’s electronic price fixing processes are similar to the non‑electronic processes previously used to establish the applicable London platinum fix where the London platinum fix process adjusted the platinum price up or down until all the buy and sell orders entered by the participating LPPM members are matched, at which time the price was declared fixed. Nevertheless, the LME PM Fix has several advantages over the previous London platinum fix. The LME’s electronic price fixing processes are intended to be transparent. The LME asserts that its electronic price fixing processes also will be fully auditable by third parties since an audit trail exists from the beginning of each fixing session. The LME also asserts that the market operation, compliance, internal audit and third-party complaint handling capabilities of the LME will support the integrity of the LME PM Fix.
 Since December 1, 2014, the Sponsor determined that the London platinum fix, which has been revised based on the new LME method and is now known as the LBMA Platinum Price (PM), which we refer to herein as the LME PM Fix, will be an appropriate basis for valuing platinum bullion received upon purchase of the Trust’s Shares, delivered upon redemption of the Trust’s Shares and for determining the value of the Trust’s platinum bullion each trading day. The “Benchmark Price” (as defined in the Trust Agreement) of the Trust’s platinum bullion as of any day will be the LME PM Fix for such day.
 As of December 1, 2014, the LPPFCL transferred the ownership of the historic and future intellectual property of the twice daily “fix” for platinum and palladium bullion to a subsidiary company of the LBMA.
 Futures Exchanges
 The most significant platinum futures exchanges are the COMEX and the TOCOM. The COMEX is the largest exchange in the world for trading precious metals futures and options and launched platinum futures in 1956, followed with options in 1990. The TOCOM has been trading platinum since 1984. Trading on these exchanges is based on fixed delivery dates and transaction sizes for the futures and options contracts traded. Trading costs are negotiable. As a matter of practice, only a small percentage of the futures market turnover ever comes to physical delivery of the platinum represented by the contracts traded. Both exchanges permit trading on margin. Margin trading can add to the speculative risk involved given the potential for margin calls if the price moves against the contract holder. The COMEX trades platinum futures almost continuously (with one short break in the evening) through its CME Globex electronic trading system and clears through its central clearing system. On June 6, 2003, the TOCOM adopted a similar clearing system. In each case, the exchange acts as a counterparty for each member for clearing purposes. The Palladium Market
 The Zurich and London Palladium Bullion Market
 Although the market for physical palladium is distributed globally, most palladium is stored and most OTC market trades are cleared through Zurich. As of September 1, 2009, London also serves as a center for the clearing of OTC trades in palladium. In addition to coordinating market activities, the LPPM acts as the principal point of contact between the market and its regulators. A primary function of the LPPM is its involvement in the promotion of refining standards by maintenance of the “London/Zurich Good Delivery Lists,” which are the lists of LPPM accredited melters and assayers of palladium. The LPPM also coordinates market clearing and vaulting, promotes good trading practices and develops standard documentation.
 Palladium is traded generally on a loco Zurich basis, meaning the precious metal is physically held in vaults in Zurich or is transferred into accounts established in Zurich. As of September 1, 2009, palladium began trading on a loco London basis as well, meaning that the precious metal is physically held in vaults in London or is transferred into accounts established in London. The basis for settlement and delivery of a loco Zurich spot trade is payment (generally in U.S. Dollars) two business days after the trade date against delivery. Delivery of the palladium can either be by physical delivery or through the clearing systems to an unallocated account.

A good delivery palladium plate or ingot on the LPPM approved list is acceptable for delivery in settlement of a transaction on the OTC market (a “Good Delivery Plate or Ingot”). A Good Delivery Plate or Ingot must contain between 32 and 192 troy ounces of palladium with a minimum fineness (or purity) of 999.5 parts per 1,000 (99.95%), be of good appearance, and be easy to handle and stack. The palladium content of a palladium plate or ingot is calculated by multiplying the gross weight by the fineness of the plate or ingot. A Good Delivery Plate or Ingot must also bear the stamp of one of the melters and assayers who are on the LPPM approved list. Unless otherwise specified, the palladium spot price always refers to that of “Good Delivery Standards” set by the LPPM.

 Market Regulation
 The global gold, silver, platinum and palladium markets are overseen and regulated by both governmental and self-regulatory organizations. In addition, certain trade associations have established rules and protocols for market practices and participants. In the United Kingdom, responsibility for the regulation of the financial market participants, including the major participating members of the LBMA and the LPPM, falls under the authority of the FCA as provided by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSM Act”). Under this act, all UK-based banks, together with other investment firms, are subject to a range of requirements, including fitness and properness, capital adequacy, liquidity, and systems and controls.
 The FCA is responsible for regulating investment products, including derivatives, and those who deal in investment products. Regulation of spot, commercial forwards, and deposits of Bullion not covered by the FSM Act is provided for by The London Code of Conduct for Non-Investment Products, which was established by market participants in conjunction with the Bank of England.
 The TOCOM has authority to perform financial and operational surveillance on its members’ trading activities, scrutinize positions held by members and large-scale customers, and monitor the price movements of futures markets by comparing them with cash and other derivative markets’ prices. To act as a Futures Commission Merchant Broker on the TOCOM, a broker must obtain a license from Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (“METI”), the regulatory authority that oversees the operations of the TOCOM.
 The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) regulates trading in commodity contracts, such as futures, options and swaps.  In addition, under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (“CEA”), the CFTC has jurisdiction to prosecute manipulation and fraud in any commodity (including precious metals) traded in interstate commerce, traded as spot as well as deliverable forwards. The CFTC is the exclusive regulator of U.S. commodity exchanges and clearing houses.    Secondary Market Trading 
 While the Trust’s investment objective is for the Shares to reflect the performance of physical gold, silver, platinum and palladium in the proportions held by the Trust, less the expenses of the Trust, the Shares may trade in the secondary market on the NYSE Arca at prices that are lower or higher relative to their net asset value (the value of the Trust’s assets less its liabilities (“NAV”)) per Share. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV per Share may be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between the NYSE Arca, COMEX and the London and Zurich bullion markets. While the Shares trade on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 PM New York time, liquidity in the global bullion market is reduced after the close of the COMEX at 1:30 PM New York time. As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the Shares may widen. 
 Valuation of Bullion and Computation of Net Asset Value 
 On each day that the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, as promptly as practicable after 4:00 p.m., New York time, on such day (“Evaluation Time”), the Trustee will evaluate the Bullion held by the Trust and determine both the ANAV and the NAV of the Trust.
 At the Evaluation Time, the Trustee will value the Trust’s Bullion on the basis of that day’s London Metal Price for such metal or, if no London Metal Price is made for a metal on such day or has not been announced by the Evaluation Time, the next most recent London Metal Price announced for such metal determined prior to the Evaluation Time will be used, unless the Sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for evaluation. In the event the Sponsor determines that the applicable London Metal Price or such other publicly available price as the Sponsor may deem fairly represents the commercial value of the Trust’s Bullion metal is not an appropriate basis for evaluation of the Trust’s Bullion metal, it shall identify an alternative basis for such evaluation to be employed by the Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor shall be liable to any person for the determination that the London Metal Price or such other publicly available price is not appropriate as a basis for evaluation of the Trust’s Bullion or for any determination as to the alternative basis for such evaluation provided that such determination is made in good faith. See “Operation of the Bullion Markets” for a description of the London Metal Price for each Bullion metal.
 Once the value of the Bullion has been determined, the Trustee will subtract all estimated accrued but unpaid fees (other than the fees accruing for such day on which the valuation takes place computed by reference to the value of the Trust or its assets), expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from the total value of the Bullion and all other assets of the Trust (other than any amounts credited to the Trust’s reserve account, if established). The resulting figure is the adjusted net asset value (“ANAV”) of the Trust. The ANAV of the Trust is used to compute the Sponsor’s Fee.
 All fees accruing for the day on which the valuation takes place computed by reference to the value of the Trust or its assets shall be calculated using the ANAV calculated for such day on which the valuation takes place. The Trustee shall subtract from the ANAV the amount of accrued fees so computed for such day and the resulting figure is the NAV of the Trust. The Trustee will also determine the NAV per Share by dividing the NAV of the Trust by the number of the Shares outstanding as of the close of trading on the NYSE Arca (which includes the net number of any Shares created or redeemed on such evaluation day).
 The Trustee’s estimation of accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and liabilities will be conclusive upon all persons interested in the Trust and no revision or correction in any computation made under the Trust Agreement will be required by reason of any difference in amounts estimated from those actually paid.


 
21

      
 The Sponsor and the Shareholders may rely on any evaluation furnished by the Trustee, and the Sponsor will have no responsibility for the evaluation’s accuracy. The determinations the Trustee makes will be made in good faith upon the basis of, and the Trustee will not be liable for any errors contained in, information reasonably available to it. The Trustee will not be liable to the Sponsor, DTC, Authorized Participants, the Shareholders or any other person for errors in judgment. However, the preceding liability exclusion will not protect the Trustee against any liability resulting from bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties.
 Change in Settlement Cycle
 Pursuant to an SEC rule amendment adopted in March 2017, the standard settlement cycle for most securities transactions by broker-dealers was shortened from three business days after the trade date (“T+3 Settlement”) to two business days following the trade date (“T+2 Settlement”), effective as of September 5, 2017.  Consistent with the rule amendment, beginning on September 5, 2017, the creation and redemption processes for the Trust changed from T+3 Settlement to T+2 Settlement.  Creation and redemption orders placed before September 5, 2017 were not subject to this change. Trust Expenses 
 The Trust’s only ordinary recurring expense is the Sponsor’s Fee. In exchange for the Sponsor’s Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume the following administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust: the Trustee’s monthly fee and out-of-pocket expenses, the Custodian’s fee and reimbursement of the Custodian’s expenses under the Custody Agreements (defined below), Exchange listing fees, SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and up to $100,000 per annum in legal expenses. The Sponsor also paid the costs of the Trust’s organization and the initial sale of the Shares, including the applicable SEC registration fees. 
 The Sponsor’s Fee accrues daily at an annualized rate equal to 0.60% of the ANAV of the Trust and is payable monthly in arrears. The Sponsor’s Fee is paid by delivery of Bullion to an account maintained by the Custodian for the Sponsor on an unallocated basis. 
 The Sponsor, from time to time, may temporarily waive all or a portion of the Sponsor’s Fee at its discretion for a stated period of time.  Presently, the Sponsor does not intend to waive any of its fee.
 Furthermore, the Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, agree to rebate all or a portion of the Sponsor’s Fee attributable to Shares held by certain institutional investors subject to minimum shareholding and lock up requirements as determined by the Sponsor to foster stability in the Trust’s asset levels. The Sponsor expects that any agreement to rebate the Sponsor’s Fee will address key terms such as the requirement that the institutional investor invest in an amount greater than 2,000,000 Shares and that all or a portion of the investment to which the rebate applies be subject to a lockup period. Furthermore, the written agreement would detail how the institutional investor may establish that shareholdings and lockup period requirements have been met (e.g., permitting the Sponsor to monitor the institutional investor’s holdings in Shares from time to time). Each written rebate agreement will be expected to have an initial term of one year and will automatically be extended on a month-to-month basis until terminated by either party on written notice. Any such rebate will be subject to negotiation and written agreement between the Sponsor and the investor on a case by case basis. The Sponsor is under no obligation to provide any rebates of the Sponsor’s Fee. Neither the Trust nor the Trustee will be a party to any Sponsor’s Fee rebate arrangements negotiated by the Sponsor.  Any Sponsor’s Fee rebate shall be paid from the funds of the Sponsor and not from the assets of the Trust.
 The Trustee will, when directed by the Sponsor, and, in the absence of such direction, may, in its discretion, sell Bullion in such quantity and at such times as may be necessary to permit payment in cash of Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor. The Trustee is authorized to sell Bullion at such times and in the smallest amounts required to permit such payments as they become due, it being the intention to avoid or minimize the Trust’s holdings of assets other than Bullion. Accordingly, the amount of Bullion to be sold will vary from time to time depending on the level of the Trust’s expenses and the market price of gold, silver, platinum and palladium. The Custodian is authorized to purchase from the Trust, at the request of the Trustee, Bullion needed to cover Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor at the price used by the Trustee to determine the value of the Bullion held by the Trust on the date of the sale. 
 The Sponsor’s Fee for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $2,132,987 (December 31, 2017: $1,942,976; December 31, 2016: $1,283,558). 
 Cash held by the Trustee pending payment of the Trust’s expenses will not bear any interest.
 Deposit of Bullion; Issuance of Shares 
 The Trust creates and redeems Shares from time to time, but only in one or more Baskets of 50,000 Shares. Only registered broker-dealers, or other securities market participants not required to register as broker-dealers such as a bank or other financial institution, who (1) are participants in DTC and (2) have entered into written agreements with the Sponsor and the Trustee (each an “Authorized Participant”) can deposit Bullion in the specified proportion of gold, silver, platinum and palladium and receive Baskets of Shares in exchange.


 
22

      
 The creation and redemption of Baskets is only made in exchange for the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of Bullion represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of Shares included in the Baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem Baskets is properly received. 
 All Bullion deposited with the Custodian or for the Custodian by the Zurich Sub-Custodian must conform to the rules, regulations practices and customs of the LBMA and LPPM, including the specifications for a London Good Delivery Bar and Plate or Ingot.    Creation and redemption orders are accepted on “business days” the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. Settlements of such orders requiring receipt or delivery, or confirmation of receipt or delivery, of Bullion in the United Kingdom, Zurich or another jurisdiction will occur on “business days” when (1) banks in the United Kingdom, Zurich or such other jurisdiction and (2) the London or Zurich Bullion markets are regularly open for business. If such banks or the London or Zurich Bullion markets are not open for regular business for a full day, such a day will only be a “business day” for settlement purposes if the settlement procedures can be completed by the end of such day. 
 On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Trustee to purchase one or more Baskets. Purchase orders must be placed no later than 3:59:59 p.m. on each business day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. A purchase order so received is effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Trustee. By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit Bullion with the Trust, as described below. Prior to the delivery of Baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Trustee the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order (as explained under “Creation and Redemption Transaction Fee” below). 
 An Authorized Participant who places a purchase order is responsible for crediting its Authorized Participant Unallocated Account, either loco London or loco Zurich, with the required Bullion deposit amount in the specified proportion of gold, silver, platinum and palladium by the second business day in London or Zurich following the purchase order date. Upon receipt of the Bullion deposit amount, the Custodian, after receiving appropriate instructions from the Authorized Participant and the Trustee, will transfer on the second business day following the purchase order date the Bullion deposit amount from the Authorized Participant Unallocated Account to the unallocated Bullion account of the Trust established with the Custodian under the Unallocated Account Agreement between the Trustee and the Custodian (the “Trust Unallocated Account”) and the Trustee will direct the Depository Trust Company (the “DTC”) to credit the number of Baskets ordered to the Authorized Participant’s DTC account. Acting on standing instructions given by the Trustee, the Custodian will transfer the Bullion deposit amount from the Trust Unallocated Account to the allocated Bullion account of the Trust established with the Custodian under the Allocated Account Agreement between the Trustee and the Custodian (the “Trust Allocated Account”), by transferring specific Bullion bars and plates or ingots from its inventory or the inventory of the Zurich Sub-Custodian to the Trust Allocated Account. The Trust’s Unallocated Account Agreement and Allocated Account Agreement are referred to collectively as the “Custody Agreements.” 
 Withdrawal of Bullion; Redemption of Shares 
 The procedures by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more Baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of Baskets. On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Trustee to redeem one or more Baskets. Redemption orders must be placed no later than 3:59:59 p.m. on each business day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. A redemption order so received is effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Trustee. The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem Baskets and do not entitle an individual owner of beneficial interests in the Shares (a “Shareholder”) to redeem any Shares in an amount less than a Basket, or to redeem Baskets other than through an Authorized Participant. 
 By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the Baskets to be redeemed through DTC’s book-entry system to the Trust not later than the second business day following the effective date of the redemption order. Prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Trustee the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order (as explained under “Creation and Redemption Transaction Fee” below). 
 The redemption distribution from the Trust consists of a credit to the redeeming Authorized Participant’s Authorized Participant Unallocated Account, either loco London or loco Zurich, representing the amount of the Bullion (in the specified proportion of gold, silver, platinum and palladium) held by the Trust evidenced by the Shares being redeemed. Fractions of a fine ounce of Bullion included in the redemption distribution smaller than 0.001 of a fine ounce are disregarded. Redemption distributions are subject to the deduction of any applicable tax or other governmental charges which may be due. If a loco swap or physical transfer is necessary to effect a loco London or loco Zurich redemption, the settlement of loco London or loco Zurich redemption deliveries may be delayed more than two, but not more than five, business days.

 Creation and Redemption Transaction Fee 
 To compensate the Trustee for services in processing the creation and redemption of Baskets, an Authorized Participant is required to pay a transaction fee to the Trustee of $500 per order to create or redeem Baskets. An order may include multiple Baskets. The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by the Trustee with the consent of the Sponsor. The Trustee shall notify DTC of any agreement to change the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of Baskets until 30 days after the date of the notice.  The Sponsor 
 The Sponsor is a Delaware limited liability company. Prior to April 27, 2018, the Sponsor was wholly-owned by ETF Securities Limited, a Jersey, Channel Islands based company. Effective April 27, 2018, ETF Securities Limited sold its membership interest in the Sponsor to Aberdeen Standard Investments Inc. (“ASII”), formerly known as Aberdeen Asset Management Inc. prior to January 1, 2019, a Delaware corporation. As a result of the sale, ASII became the sole member of the Sponsor. ASII is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Standard Life Aberdeen plc, which together with its affiliates and subsidiaries, is collectively referred to as “Aberdeen.” Aberdeen Standard Investments is a brand of the investment businesses of Standard Life Investments plc, its affiliates and subsidiaries.

The Sponsor also paid the costs of the Trust’s organization and the initial sale of the Shares, including the applicable SEC registration fees. 
 The Sponsor does not exercise day-to-day oversight over the Trustee or the Custodian. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor Trustee (i) if the Trustee ceases to meet certain objective requirements (including the requirement that it have capital, surplus and undivided profits of at least $150 million), (ii) if, having received written notice of a material breach of its obligations under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee has not cured the breach within 30 days, or (iii) if the Trustee refuses to consent to the implementation of an amendment to the Trust’s initial Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The Sponsor also has the right to replace the Trustee during the 90 days following any merger, consolidation or conversion in which the Trustee is not the surviving entity or, in its discretion, on the fifth anniversary of the creation of the Trust or on any subsequent third anniversary thereafter. The Sponsor also has the right to approve any new or additional custodian that the Trustee may wish to appoint and any new or additional Zurich Sub-Custodian that the Custodian may wish to appoint. 
 The Sponsor or one of its affiliates or agents (1) develops a marketing plan for the Trust on an ongoing basis, (2) prepares marketing materials regarding the Shares, including the content of the Trust’s website and (3) executes the marketing plan for the Trust.

      The Trustee’s Role    The Trustee is generally responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Trust, including keeping the Trust’s operational records. The Trustee’s principal responsibilities include (1) transferring the Trust’s Bullion as needed to pay the Sponsor’s Fee in Bullion (Bullion transfers are expected to occur approximately monthly in the ordinary course), (2) valuing the Trust’s Bullion and calculating the NAV of the Trust and the NAV per Share, (3) receiving and processing orders from Authorized Participants to create and redeem Baskets and coordinating the processing of such orders with the Custodian and DTC, (4) selling the Trust’s Bullion as needed to pay any extraordinary Trust expenses that are not assumed by the Sponsor, (5) when appropriate, making distributions of cash or other property to Shareholders, and (6) receiving and reviewing reports from or on the Custodian’s custody of and transactions in the Trust’s Bullion. The Trustee shall, with respect to directing the Custodian, act in accordance with the instructions of the Sponsor. If the Custodian resigns, the Trustee shall appoint an additional or replacement Custodian selected by the Sponsor. The Trustee intends to regularly communicate with the Sponsor to monitor the overall performance of the Trust. The Trustee does not monitor the performance of the Custodian, the Zurich Sub-Custodians, or any other sub-custodian other than to review the reports provided by the Custodian pursuant to the Custody Agreements. The Trustee, along with the Sponsor, will liaise with the Trust’s legal, accounting and other professional service providers as needed. The Trustee will assist and support the Sponsor with the preparation of all periodic reports required to be filed with the SEC on behalf of the Trust.
 The Trustee’s monthly fees and out-of-pocket expenses will be paid by the Sponsor. 
 Affiliates of the Trustee may from time to time act as Authorized Participants or purchase or sell Bullion or Shares for their own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. Affiliates of the Trustee are subject to the same transaction fee as other Authorized Participants.
 The Custodian 
 JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan”) serves as the Custodian of the Trust’s Bullion. JPMorgan is a national banking association organized under the laws of the United States of America. JPMorgan is subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. JPMorgan’s London office is regulated by the FCA and is located at 25 Bank Street, London, E14 5JP, United Kingdom. JPMorgan is a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co.  While the United Kingdom operations of the Custodian are regulated by the FCA, the custodial services provided by the Custodian and any sub-custodian, including the Zurich Sub-Custodian under the Custody Agreements, are presently not a regulated activity subject to the supervision and rules of the FCA.    The Custodian’s Role    The Custodian is responsible for the safekeeping of the Trust’s Bullion deposited with it by Authorized Participants in connection with the creation of Baskets. The Custodian is also responsible for selecting the Zurich Sub-Custodians and its other sub-custodians, if any. The Custodian facilitates the transfer of Bullion in and out of the Trust through the unallocated Bullion accounts it will maintain for each Authorized Participant and the unallocated and allocated Bullion accounts it will maintain for the Trust. The Custodian holds at its London, England vault premises that portion of the Trust’s allocated Bullion to be held in London. The Zurich Sub-Custodian holds at its Zurich, Switzerland vault premises that portion of the Trust’s allocated platinum and palladium to be held in Zurich on behalf of the Custodian. The Custodian is responsible for allocating specific bars of physical gold and silver and specific plates or ingots of physical platinum and palladium to the Trust’s allocated Bullion account. The Custodian provides the Trustee with regular reports detailing the Bullion transfers in and out of the Trust’s unallocated and allocated Bullion accounts and identifying the gold and silver bars and the platinum and palladium plates or ingots held in the Trust’s allocated Bullion account.
 The Custodian’s fees and expenses under the Custody Agreements are paid by the Sponsor. 
 The Custodian and its affiliates may from time to time act as Authorized Participants or purchase or sell Bullion or Shares for their own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. The Custodian and its affiliates are subject to the same transaction fee as other Authorized Participants.

Inspection of Bullion
 Under the Custody Agreements, the Trustee, the Sponsor and the Sponsor’s auditors and inspectors may, only up to twice a year, visit the premises of the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodians for the purpose of examining the Trust’s Bullion and certain related records maintained by the Custodian. Any such inspection rights with respect to the Zurich Sub-Custodian are expected to be granted in accordance with the normal course of dealing between the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian. Visits by auditors and inspectors to the Zurich Sub-Custodians’ facilities will be arranged through the Custodian. Other than with respect to the Zurich Sub-Custodians, the Trustee and the Sponsor have no right to visit the premises of any sub-custodian for the purposes of examining the Trust’s Bullion or any records maintained by the sub-custodian, and no sub-custodian is obligated to cooperate in any review the Trustee or the Sponsor may wish to conduct of the facilities, procedures, records or creditworthiness of such sub-custodian. 
 The Sponsor has exercised its right to visit the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian, in order to examine the Bullion and the records maintained by them. Inspections were conducted by Inspectorate International Limited, a leading commodity inspection and testing company retained by the Sponsor, as of May 11, 2018 and December 31, 2018.

      Description of the Shares 
 General    The Trustee is authorized under the Trust Agreement to create and issue an unlimited number of Shares. The Trustee creates Shares only in Baskets (a Basket equals a block of 50,000 Shares) and only upon the order of an Authorized Participant. The Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust and have no par value. Any creation and issuance of Shares above the amount registered on the Trust’s then-current and effective registration statement with the SEC will require the registration of such additional Shares. 
 Description of Limited Rights    The Shares do not represent a traditional investment and Shareholders should not view them as similar to “shares” of a corporation operating a business enterprise with management and a board of directors. Shareholders do not have the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of Shares of a corporation, including, for example, the right to bring “oppression” or “derivative” actions. All Shares are of the same class with equal rights and privileges. Each Share is transferable, is fully paid and non-assessable and entitles the holder to vote on the limited matters upon which Shareholders may vote under the Trust Agreement. The Shares do not entitle their holders to any conversion or pre-emptive rights, or, except as provided below, any redemption rights or rights to distributions. 
 Distributions    If the Trust is terminated and liquidated, the Trustee will distribute to the Shareholders any amounts remaining after the satisfaction of all outstanding liabilities of the Trust and the establishment of such reserves for applicable taxes, other governmental charges and contingent or future liabilities as the Trustee shall determine. Shareholders of record on the record date fixed by the Trustee for a distribution will be entitled to receive their pro rata portion of any distribution. 
 Voting and Approvals    Under the Trust Agreement, Shareholders have no voting rights, except in limited circumstances. The Trustee may terminate the Trust upon the agreement of Shareholders owning at least 75% of the outstanding Shares. In addition, certain amendments to the Trust Agreement require advance notice to the Shareholders before the effectiveness of such amendments, but no Shareholder vote or approval is required for any amendment to the Trust Agreement. 
 Redemption of the Shares    The Shares may only be redeemed by or through an Authorized Participant and only in Baskets. 
 Book-Entry Form    Individual certificates will not be issued for the Shares. Instead, one or more global certificates is deposited by the Trustee with DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC. The global certificates evidence all of the Shares outstanding at any time. Under the Trust Agreement, Shareholders are limited to (1) participants in DTC such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies (DTC Participants), (2) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant (Indirect Participants), and (3) those banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and others who hold interests in the Shares through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants. The Shares are only transferable through the book-entry system of DTC. Shareholders who are not DTC Participants may transfer their Shares through DTC by instructing the DTC Participant holding their Shares (or by instructing the Indirect Participant or other entity through which their Shares are held) to transfer the Shares. Transfers will be made in accordance with standard securities industry practice. 
 Custody of the Trust’s Bullion 
 Custody of the physical gold and silver deposited with and held by the Trust is provided by the Custodian at its London, England vaults and by other sub-custodians on a temporary basis. Custody of the physical platinum and palladium deposited with and held by the Trust is provided by the Custodian at its London, England vaults and by the Zurich Sub-Custodians selected by the Custodian in their Zurich, Switzerland vaults and by other sub-custodians on a temporary basis. The Custodian is a market maker, clearer and approved weigher under the rules of the LBMA and the LPPM. 
 The Custodian is the custodian of the physical Bullion credited to the Trust Allocated Account in accordance with the Custody Agreements. The Custodian segregates the physical Bullion credited to the Trust Allocated Account from any other precious metal it holds or holds for others by entering appropriate entries in its books and records, and requires each Zurich Sub-Custodian to also segregate the physical platinum and palladium of the Trust that it holds from the other platinum and palladium held by it for other customers of the Custodian and such Zurich Sub-Custodian’s other customers. The Custodian requires each Zurich Sub-Custodian to identify in its books and records the Trust as having the rights to the physical platinum and palladium credited to its Trust Allocated Account. Under the Custody Agreements, the Trustee, the Sponsor and the Sponsor’s auditors and inspectors may inspect the vaults of the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian.  See “Inspection of Bullion”.


 
26

      The Custodian, as instructed by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust, is authorized to accept, on behalf of the Trust, deposits of Bullion in unallocated form. Acting on standing instructions specified in the Custody Agreements, the Custodian allocates Bullion deposited in unallocated form with the Trust by selecting bars of gold or silver or plates or ingots of platinum or palladium for deposit to the Trust Allocated Account or, with respect to platinum or palladium to be held in Zurich, require the Zurich Sub-Custodians to allocate platinum or palladium deposited in unallocated form with the Trust by selecting plates or ingots of platinum or palladium for deposit for the benefit of the Trust Allocated Amount. All physical gold and silver allocated to the Trust must conform to the rules, regulations, practices and customs of the LBMA. All physical platinum and palladium allocated to the Trust must conform to the rules, regulations, practices and customs of the LPPM. 
 The process of withdrawing Bullion from the Trust for a redemption of a Basket follows the same general procedure as for depositing Bullion with the Trust for a creation of a Basket, only in reverse. Each transfer of Bullion between the Trust Allocated Account and the Trust Unallocated Account connected with a creation or redemption of a Basket may result in a small amount of Bullion being held in the Trust Unallocated Account after the completion of the transfer. In making deposits and withdrawals between the Trust Allocated Account and the Trust Unallocated Account, the Custodian will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the amounts of gold, silver, platinum and palladium held in the Trust Unallocated Account as of the close of each business day. See “Deposit of Bullion; Issuance of Shares” and “Withdrawal of Bullion; Redemption of Shares.”    United States Federal Income Tax Consequences
 The following discussion of the material US federal income tax consequences generally applies to the purchase, ownership and disposition of Shares by a US Shareholder (as defined below), and certain US federal income tax consequences that may apply to an investment in Shares by a Non-US Shareholder (as defined below). The discussion is based on the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the “Code”). The discussion below is based on the Code, United States Treasury Regulations (“Treasury Regulations”) promulgated under the Code and judicial and administrative interpretations of the Code, all as in effect on the date of this annual report and all of which are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively. The tax treatment of Shareholders may vary depending upon their own particular circumstances. Certain Shareholders (including broker-dealers, traders, banks and other financial institutions, insurance companies, real estate investment trusts, tax-exempt entities, Shareholders whose functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar or other investors with special circumstances) may be subject to special rules not discussed below. In addition, the following discussion applies only to investors who hold Shares as “capital assets” within the meaning of Code section 1221 and not as part of a straddle, hedging transaction or a conversion or constructive sale transaction. Moreover, the discussion below does not address the effect of any state, local or foreign tax law or any transfer tax on an owner of Shares. Purchasers of Shares are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to all federal, state, local and foreign tax law or any transfer tax considerations potentially applicable to their investment in Shares, including substantial changes to the Code made in the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (P.L. 115-97).    For purposes of this discussion, a “US Shareholder” is a Shareholder that is: 
 •An individual who is treated as a citizen or resident of the United States for US federal income tax purposes; 
 •A corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for US federal tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof; 
 •An estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for US federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or 
 •A trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more US persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. 
 A Shareholder that is not a US Shareholder as defined above (other than a partnership, or an entity treated as a partnership for US federal tax purposes) generally is considered a “Non-US Shareholder” for purposes of this discussion. For US federal income tax purposes, the treatment of any beneficial owner of an interest in a partnership, including any entity treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes, generally depends upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. Partnerships and partners in partnerships should consult their tax advisors about the US federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of Shares. 
 Taxation of the Trust    The Trust is classified as a “grantor trust” for US federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Trust itself is not subject to US federal income tax. Instead, the Trust’s income and expenses “flow through” to the Shareholders, and the Trustee reports the Trust’s income, gains, losses and deductions to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) on that basis. 
 Taxation of US Shareholders    Shareholders generally are treated, for US federal income tax purposes, as if they directly owned a pro rata share of the underlying assets held by the Trust. Shareholders are also treated as if they directly received their respective pro rata share of the Trust’s income, if any, and as if they directly incurred their respective pro rata share of the Trust’s expenses. In the case of a Shareholder that purchases Shares for cash, its initial tax basis in its pro rata share of the assets held by the Trust at the time it acquires its Shares is 

 
27

      equal to its cost of acquiring the Shares. In the case of a Shareholder that acquires its Shares as part of a creation of a Basket, the delivery of bullion to the Trust in exchange for the Shares is not a taxable event to the Shareholder, and the Shareholder’s tax basis and holding period for the Shareholder’s pro rata share of the bullion held by the Trust are the same as its tax basis and holding period for the Bullion delivered in exchange therefore (except to the extent of any cash contributed for such Shares). For purposes of this discussion, it is assumed that all of a Shareholder’s Shares are acquired on the same date and at the same price per Share. Shareholders that hold multiple lots of Shares, or that are contemplating acquiring multiple lots of Shares, should consult their tax advisors. 
 When the Trust sells or transfers precious metal, for example to pay expenses, a Shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the Shareholder’s pro rata share of the amount realized by the Trust upon the sale or transfer and (2) the Shareholder’s tax basis for its pro rata share of the precious metal that was sold or transferred. Such gain or loss will generally be long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending upon whether the Shareholder has a holding period in its Shares of longer than one year. A Shareholder’s tax basis for its share or any precious metal sold by the Trust generally will be determined by multiplying the Shareholder’s total basis for its Shares of all of the precious metal held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale, by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of precious metal sold, and the denominator of which is the total amount of the precious metal held by the Trust immediately prior to the sale. After any such sale, a Shareholder’s tax basis for its pro rata share of the Bullion remaining in the Trust will be equal to its tax basis for its Shares immediately prior to the sale, less the portion of such basis allocable to its share of the precious metal that was sold. 
 Upon a Shareholder’s sale of some or all of its Shares, the Shareholder will be treated as having sold a pro rata share of the precious metal held in the Trust at the time of the sale. Accordingly, the Shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the amount realized pursuant to the sale of the Shares, and (2) the Shareholder’s tax basis for the Shares sold, as determined in the manner described in the preceding paragraph. 
 A redemption of some or all of a Shareholder’s Shares in exchange for the underlying precious metal represented by the Shares redeemed generally will not be a taxable event to the Shareholder. The Shareholder’s tax basis for the precious metal received in the redemption generally will be the same as the Shareholder’s tax basis for the Shares redeemed. The Shareholder’s holding period with respect to the Bullion received should include the period during which the Shareholder held the Shares redeemed. A subsequent sale of the precious metal received by the Shareholder will be a taxable event. 
 An Authorized Participant and other investors may be able to re-invest, on a tax-deferred basis, in-kind redemption proceeds received from exchange-traded products that are substantially similar to the Trust in the Trust’s Shares. Authorized Participants and other investors should consult their tax advisors as to whether and under what circumstances the reinvestment in the Shares of proceeds from substantially similar exchange-traded products can be accomplished on a tax-deferred basis. 
 Under current law, gains recognized by individuals, estates or trusts from the sale of “collectibles,” including physical Bullion, held for more than one year are taxed at a maximum federal income tax rate of 28%, rather than the 20% rate applicable to most other long-term capital gains. For these purposes, gain recognized by an individual upon the sale of Shares held for more than one year, or attributable to the Trust’s sale of any physical Bullion which the Shareholder is treated (through its ownership of Shares) as having held for more than one year, generally will be taxed at a maximum rate of 28%. The tax rates for capital gains recognized upon the sale of assets held by an individual US Shareholder for one year or less or by a corporate taxpayer are generally the same as those at which ordinary income is taxed. 
 In addition, high-income individuals and certain trusts and estates are subject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax that is imposed on net investment income and gain.  Shareholders should consult their tax advisor regarding this tax.
 Brokerage Fees and Trust Expenses    Any brokerage or other transaction fees incurred by a Shareholder in purchasing Shares is treated as part of the Shareholder’s tax basis in the Shares. Similarly, any brokerage fee incurred by a Shareholder in selling Shares reduces the amount realized by the Shareholder with respect to the sale. 
 Shareholders will be required to recognize gain or loss upon a sale of Bullion by the Trust (as discussed above), even though some or all of the proceeds of such sale are used by the Trustee to pay Trust expenses. Shareholders may deduct their respective pro rata share of each expense incurred by the Trust to the same extent as if they directly incurred the expense. Shareholders who are individuals, estates or trusts, however, may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of the Trust, to the extent that such expenses may be deducted, as miscellaneous itemized deductions. Under the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (P.L. 115-97), miscellaneous itemized deductions, including expenses for the production of income, will not be deductible for either regular federal income tax or alternative minimum tax purposes for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026.

      Investment by Regulated Investment Companies    Mutual funds and other investment vehicles which are “regulated investment companies” within the meaning of Code section 851 should consult with their tax advisors concerning (1) the likelihood that an investment in Shares, although they are a “security” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, may be considered an investment in the underlying bullion for purposes of Code section 851(b), and (2) the extent to which an investment in Shares might nevertheless be consistent with preservation of their qualification under Code section 851.  In recent administrative guidance, the IRS stated that it will no longer issue rulings under Code section 851(b) relating to the determination of whether or not an instrument or position is a “security”, but, instead, intends to defer to guidance from the SEC for such determination.
 United States Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Tax for US and Non-US Shareholders    The Trustee or the appropriate broker will file certain information returns with the IRS, and provides certain tax-related information to Shareholders, in accordance with applicable Treasury Regulations. Each Shareholder will be provided with information regarding its allocable portion of the Trust’s annual income (if any) and expenses. 
 A US Shareholder may be subject to US backup withholding tax in certain circumstances unless it provides its taxpayer identification number and complies with certain certification procedures. Non-US Shareholders may have to comply with certification procedures to establish that they are not a U.S. person in order to avoid the backup withholding tax. 
 The amount of any backup withholding tax will be allowed as a credit against a Shareholder’s US federal income tax liability and may entitle such a Shareholder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS. 
 Income Taxation of Non-US Shareholders    The Trust does not expect to generate taxable income except for gains (if any) upon the sale of precious metal. A Non-US Shareholder generally is not subject to US federal income tax with respect to gains recognized upon the sale or other disposition of Shares, or upon the sale of precious metal by the Trust, unless (1) the Non-US Shareholder is an individual and is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the sale or other disposition, and the gain is treated as being from United States sources; or (2) the gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-US Shareholder of a trade or business in the United States. 
 Taxation in Jurisdictions other than the United States    Prospective purchasers of Shares that are based in or acting out of a jurisdiction other than the United States are advised to consult their own tax advisers as to the tax consequences, under the laws of such jurisdiction (or any other jurisdiction not being the United States to which they are subject), of their purchase, holding, sale and redemption of or any other dealing in Shares and, in particular, as to whether any value added tax, other consumption tax or transfer tax is payable in relation to such purchase, holding, sale, redemption or other dealing.
 ERISA and Related Considerations
 The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and/or Code section 4975 impose certain requirements on certain employee benefit plans and certain other plans and arrangements, including individual retirement accounts and annuities, Keogh plans, and certain commingled investment vehicles or insurance company general or separate accounts in which such plans or arrangements are invested (collectively, “Plans”), and on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to the investment of “plan assets” of a Plan. Government plans and some church plans are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the provisions of section 4975 of the Code, but may be subject to substantially similar rules under other federal law, or under state or local law (“Other Law”).    In contemplating an investment of a portion of Plan assets in Shares, the Plan fiduciary responsible for making such investment should carefully consider, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the Plan and the “Risk Factors” discussed above and whether such investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities under ERISA or Other Law, including, but not limited to: (1) whether the investment is permitted under the Plan’s governing documents, (2) whether the fiduciary has the authority to make the investment, (3) whether the investment is consistent with the Plan’s funding objectives, (4) the tax effects of the investment on the Plan, and (5) whether the investment is prudent considering the factors discussed in this report. In addition, ERISA and Code section 4975 prohibit a broad range of transactions involving assets of a plan and persons who are “parties in interest” under ERISA or “disqualified persons” under section 4975 of the Code. A violation of these rules may result in the imposition of significant excise taxes and other liabilities. Plans subject to Other Law may be subject to similar restrictions. 
 It is anticipated that the Shares will constitute “publicly offered securities” as defined in the Department of Labor “Plan Asset Regulations,” §2510.3-101 (b)(2) as modified by section 3(42) of ERISA. Accordingly, pursuant to the Plan Asset Regulations, only Shares purchased by a Plan, and not an interest in the underlying assets held in the Trust, should be treated as assets of the Plan, for purposes of applying the “fiduciary responsibility” rules of ERISA and the “prohibited transaction” rules of ERISA and the Code. Fiduciaries of plans subject to Other Law should consult legal counsel to determine whether there would be a similar result under the Other Law.    Investment by Certain Retirement Plans

      Code section 408(m) provides that the acquisition of a “collectible” by an individual retirement account (“IRA”) or a participant-directed account maintained under any plan that is tax-qualified under Code section 401(a) (“Tax Qualified Account”) is treated as a taxable distribution from the account to the owner of the IRA, or to the participant for whom the Tax Qualified Account is maintained, of an amount equal to the cost to the account of acquiring the collectible.   The term “collectible” is defined to include, with certain exceptions, “any metal or gem”. The IRS has issued several private letter rulings to the effect that a purchase by an IRA, or by a participant-directed account under a Code section 401(a) plan, of publicly-traded Shares in a trust holding precious metals will not be treated as resulting in a taxable distribution to the IRA owner or Tax Qualified Account participant under Code section 408(m). However the private letter rulings provide that, if any of the Shares so purchased are distributed from the IRA or Tax Qualified Account to the IRA owner or Tax Qualified Account participant, or if any precious metal is received by such IRA or Tax Qualified Account upon the redemption of any of the Shares purchased by it, the Shares or precious metal so distributed will be subject to federal income tax in the year of distribution, to the extent provided under the applicable provisions of Code sections 408(d), 408(m) or 402. Accordingly, potential IRA or Tax Qualified Account investors are urged to consult with their own professional advisors concerning the treatment of an investment in Shares under Code section 408(m).
