Item 1. Business
Overview
Ameriprise is a diversified financial services company with a more than 120-year history of providing solutions to help clients confidently achieve their financial objectives. Ameriprise Financial, Inc. is a holding company incorporated in Delaware that primarily engages in business through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, references to “Ameriprise,” “Ameriprise Financial,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” may refer to Ameriprise Financial, Inc. exclusively, to our entire family of companies, or to one or more of our subsidiaries. Our headquarters is located at 55 Ameriprise Financial Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55474. We also maintain executive offices in New York City.
We are a long-standing leader in financial planning and advice with $823 billion in assets under management and administration as of December 31, 2018. We offer a broad range of products and services designed to achieve individual and institutional clients’ financial objectives. Our strategy is centered on helping our clients confidently achieve their goals by providing holistic advice and by managing and protecting their assets and income. We utilize two go-to-market approaches in carrying out this strategy: Wealth Management and Asset Management.
Wealth Management
Our wealth management capabilities are centered on the long-term, personal relationships between our clients and our financial advisors (our “advisors”). Through our advisors, we offer financial planning and advice, as well as banking and full-service brokerage services, primarily to retail clients through our affiliated advisors. These products and services are designed to be used as solutions for our clients’ cash and liquidity, asset accumulation, income, protection, and estate and wealth transfer needs. The financial product solutions we offer through our advisors include both our own products and services and the products of other companies. Our advisor network is the primary channel through which we offer our own life and disability income insurance, annuity products and services, and a range of banking products. Our focus on personal relationships, as demonstrated by our exclusive Confident Retirement® approach to financial planning, allows us to address our clients’ evolving financial and retirement-related needs to help them live brilliantly, now and in the future. Over the years we have evolved our target market to move more upmarket as we respond to the needs of our clients. We currently view our primary target market segment as the mass affluent and affluent (which we define as households with investable assets of more than $100,000), and increasingly those with $500,000 to $5,000,000 in investable assets.
Our network of approximately 10,000 advisors is the primary means through which we engage in our wealth management activities. We offer our advisors training, tools, leadership, marketing programs and other field and centralized support to assist them in serving their clients. Our nationally recognized brand combined with our practice vision, local marketing and field support, integrated operating platform, practice expansion and succession opportunities and comprehensive set of products and solutions create a compelling value proposition for financial advisors, as evidenced by our strong advisor retention rate and our ability to attract and retain experienced and productive advisors. We continuously invest in, develop, and refine capabilities and tools designed to maximize advisor productivity and client satisfaction.
We are in a compelling position to capitalize on significant demographic and market trends driving increased demand for financial advice and solutions. In the U.S., the ongoing transition of baby boomers into retirement continues to drive demand for financial advice and solutions. In addition, the amount of investable assets held by mass affluent and affluent households (our target market) has grown and now accounts for over half of U.S. investable assets. We believe our differentiated financial planning model, broad range of products and solutions, and demonstrated financial strength throughout the economic and market uncertainty of recent years position us to capitalize on these trends and best serve our clients in achieving their goals.
Asset Management
Our asset management capabilities (represented by the Columbia Threadneedle Investments® brand) are global in scale. We offer a broad spectrum of investment advice and products to individual, institutional and high-net worth investors. These investment products are primarily provided through third parties, though we also provide our asset management products through our advisor channel. Our underlying asset management philosophy is rooted in delivering consistently strong, competitive investment performance. The quality and breadth of our asset management capabilities are demonstrated by 101 of our mutual funds being rated as four- and five-star funds by Morningstar.
We are positioned to continue to grow our assets under management in the long-term and strengthen our asset management offerings to existing and new clients. Our asset management capabilities are well positioned to address mature markets in the U.S. and Europe. We also have the capability to leverage our existing strengths in order to effectively expand into new global and emerging markets. In the past few years, we have expanded beyond our traditional strengths in the U.S. and UK to gather assets in Continental Europe, Asia, Australia, the Middle East, South America and Africa. In addition, we continue to identify and pursue opportunities to leverage the collective capabilities of our global asset management business in order to enhance our current range of investment solutions, develop new solutions and investment management strategies that are responsive to client demand in an increasingly complex marketplace, and maximize the distribution capabilities of our global business.
Financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results. In addition, the business, political and regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to elevated uncertainty and substantial and frequent change. Accordingly, we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives and obtaining operational and strategic leverage from our core capabilities. The success of these and other strategies may be affected by the factors discussed below in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K - “Risk Factors”, and other factors as discussed herein.
The financial results from the businesses underlying our go-to-market approaches are reflected in our five operating segments:

• | Advice & Wealth Management;


• | Asset Management;


• | Annuities;


• | Protection; and


• | Corporate & Other.

As a diversified financial services firm, we believe our ability to gather assets across the enterprise is best measured by our assets under management and administration metric. At December 31, 2018, we had $823 billion in assets under management and administration compared to $897 billion as of December 31, 2017. For a more detailed discussion of assets under management and administration see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
The following chart shows how we have executed on our strategy to shift our business mix toward lower capital, fee-based business in Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management and that Advice & Wealth Management now represents nearly half of our pretax adjusted operated earnings. This chart shows our current business mix through the contributions of each segment to our pretax adjusted operating earnings (excluding Corporate & Other segment) as well as a historical comparison. 
Our Principal Brands
We utilize multiple brands for the products and services offered by our businesses. We believe that using distinct brands for these products and services allows us to differentiate them in the marketplace.

We use the Ameriprise Financial® brand as our enterprise brand, as well as the name of our advisor network and certain of our retail products and services. The retail products and services that use the Ameriprise Financial brand include those that we provide through our advisors (e.g., financial planning, investment advisory accounts, retail brokerage services and banking products) and products and services that we market directly to consumers or through affinity groups (e.g., personal auto and home).
Columbia Threadneedle Investments® brand is our global brand that represents the combined capabilities, resources and reach of Columbia Management and Threadneedle. This brand reinforces the strength of both firms in their established markets of the UK, Europe and the U.S. and helps us grow our presence in key markets including Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. 
We use our RiverSource® brand for our annuity and protection products issued by the RiverSource Life companies, including our life and disability income insurance products. 

History and Development
Our company has a more than 120-year history of providing solutions to help clients confidently achieve their financial objectives. Our earliest predecessor company, Investors Syndicate, was founded in 1894 to provide face-amount certificates to consumers with a need for conservative investments. By 1937, Investors Syndicate had expanded its product offerings through Federal Housing Authority mortgages, and later, mutual funds, by establishing Investors Mutual, one of the pioneers in the mutual fund industry. In 1949, Investors Syndicate was renamed Investors Diversified Services, Inc., or IDS. In 1957, IDS added life insurance products, and later, annuity products, through IDS Life Insurance Company (now known as “RiverSource Life Insurance Company”). In 1972, IDS began to expand its network by delivering investment products directly to clients of unaffiliated financial institutions. IDS also introduced its comprehensive financial planning processes to clients, integrating the identification of client needs with the products and services to address those needs in the 1970s, and it introduced fee-based planning in the 1980s.
In 1979, IDS became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alleghany Corporation pursuant to a merger. In 1983, our company was formed as a Delaware corporation in connection with American Express’ acquisition of IDS Financial Services from Alleghany Corporation in 1984. We changed our name to “American Express Financial Corporation” (“AEFC”) and began marketing our products and services under the American Express brand in 1994. To provide retail clients with a more comprehensive set of products and services, we significantly expanded our offering of non-proprietary mutual funds in the late 1990s and in 2003, we acquired the business of Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings.
On September 30, 2005, American Express consummated a distribution of the shares of AEFC to American Express shareholders, at which time we became an independent, publicly traded company and changed our name to “Ameriprise Financial, Inc.” In 2008, we completed the acquisitions of H&R Block Financial Advisors, Inc. and J. & W. Seligman & Co. Incorporated. In 2010, we completed the acquisition of the long-term asset management business of Columbia Management from Bank of America, which significantly enhanced the scale and performance of our retail mutual fund and institutional asset management businesses. In 2016, we completed the acquisition of Emerging Global Advisors, LLC, a registered investment advisor and provider of strategic beta portfolios based on emerging markets. In 2017, we acquired Investment Professionals, Inc. (“IPI”), an independent broker-dealer specializing in the on-site delivery of investment programs for financial institutions, including banks and credit unions that gives us scale entry into the bank channel. In 2017 we also acquired Lionstone Partners, LLC (“Lionstone Investments”), a leading national real estate investment firm, specializing in investment strategies based upon proprietary analytics that expands our real estate capabilities. This inorganic growth has allowed us to significantly enhance the scale, performance, and product offerings of our brokerage, financial planning, retail mutual funds and institutional asset management business in order to best serve our clients.
In 2006, we sold our large-scale retirement plan recordkeeping business to Wachovia Bank, N.A. (now Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.). We initiated the disposition of our institutional trust and custody business in 2008 to J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and completed that restructuring in early 2009. In 2011, we completed the sale of Securities America Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries to Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services, Inc.
In January 2013, we completed the conversion of our federal savings bank subsidiary, Ameriprise Bank, FSB, to a limited powers national trust bank now known as Ameriprise National Trust Bank. In connection with this 2013 conversion, we terminated deposit-taking and credit-originating activities of Ameriprise Bank. In 2018, we made the strategic decision to seek to expand the banking 
products and services we can provide directly to our clients, and commenced the ongoing process to convert Ameriprise National Trust Bank into a federal savings bank with the capabilities to offer FDIC insured deposits and a range of lending products.

Our Segments - Advice & Wealth Management
Our Advice & Wealth Management segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full-service brokerage services, primarily to retail clients through our financial advisors. These services are centered on long-term, personal relationships between our advisors and our clients and focus on helping clients confidently achieve their financial goals. Our financial advisors provide a distinctive, holistic approach to financial planning and have access to a broad selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs and achieve their goals.
A significant portion of revenues in this segment is fee-based, driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on owned assets primarily from certificate products; as Ameriprise Bank evolves its deposit base following commencement of operations, it, too, would provide a source of net investment income. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for providing non-affiliated products and intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for providing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment. All intersegment activity is eliminated in our consolidated results.
Our Financial Advisor Platform
We provide financial planning, advice and brokerage services to clients through our nationwide financial advisor network. Advisors can choose to affiliate with us in multiple ways, with each affiliation offering different levels of support and compensation. The affiliation options are:

• | Employee Advisors (Ameriprise Advisor Group). Under this option, an advisor is an employee of our company and receives a higher level of support, including leadership, training, office space and staff support. We pay compensation that is competitive with other employee advisor models, which is generally lower than that of our franchisee advisors given the higher level of support we provide our employee advisors. Some employee advisors are employed in the Ameriprise Advisor Center (“AAC”), our dedicated platform for remote-based sales and service to Ameriprise retail customers through a team model.


• | Franchisee Advisors (Ameriprise Franchise Group). Under this option, an advisor is an independent contractor franchisee who affiliates with our company and has the right to use the Ameriprise brand. We pay our franchisee advisors a higher payout rate than our employee advisors as they are responsible for paying their own overhead, staff compensation and other business expenses. In addition, our franchisee advisors pay a franchise association fee and other fees in exchange for the support we offer and the right to use our brand name. The support we offer to our franchisee advisors includes generalist and specialist leadership support, technology platforms and tools, training and marketing programs.


• | Bank Channel Advisors (Ameriprise Financial Institutions Group). Our acquisition of IPI in 2017 added a new capability where we specialize in the on-site delivery of investment programs for financial institutions including banks and credit unions. Within this channel, we have different types of relationships with our financial institution partners as well as a variety of ways for advisors to affiliate with us.

We are committed to providing our advisors with the resources and support necessary to manage and grow their practices. Our platform offers advisors (and therefore clients) the flexibility of operating on a commission-based brokerage basis as well as on a fee-based advisory basis. Advisors have access to training and materials reflecting our differentiated financial planning model and Confident Retirement planning approach, our nationally recognized brand and “Be Brilliant®” advertising campaign, local marketing support capabilities and our full range of proprietary and non-proprietary advice and product solutions. Our demonstrated financial strength as well as our dedication to our clients also benefits our advisor practices. We expect to continue to invest in the capabilities of and support provided to our advisor platform, with the goal of continuing to best serve our clients, increase advisor productivity and improve our ability to attract and retain advisors.
Our nationwide advisor network consisted of approximately 10,000 advisors as of December 31, 2018, which includes approximately 2,200 employee advisors and advisors in our bank channel as well as approximately 7,800 independent franchisees or employees or contractors of franchisees. Of these advisors (and excluding AAC advisors, roughly 52% have been with us for more than 10 years, with an average tenure of over 20 years. Among advisors who have been with us for more than 10 years, we have a retention rate of over 95%. We believe our strong advisor retention rate, as well as our ability to recruit experienced advisors, speaks to the value proposition we offer our advisors.
Our advisors offer clients a diversified set of cash and liquidity management, asset accumulation, income, protection, and estate and wealth transfer products and services, as well as a broad selection of financial products from other unaffiliated companies (as described below).
Brokerage and Investment Advisory Services
Individual and Family Financial Services
Our personalized financial planning approach is designed to focus on all aspects of our clients’ finances. After understanding our clients’ needs, our advisors seek to identify solutions to address those needs across four cornerstones: cash and liabilities, investments, protection and taxes. We believe this approach helps our clients build a solid financial foundation, persevere through difficult economies and challenging markets, and ultimately achieve their financial goals. We offer a broad array of products and services in each of these categories, including those carrying the Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management or RiverSource name, as well as solutions offered by unaffiliated firms.
Our advisors deliver financial solutions to our advisory clients principally by building long-term personal relationships through financial planning that is responsive to clients’ evolving needs, priorities, and goals, in part through our exclusive Confident Retirement approach. Our exclusive Confident Retirement approach involves a comprehensive assessment of retirement income sources and assets, a client’s plans and goals for retirement and an analysis of what is needed to fund the four principal types of expenses and liabilities encountered during retirement: covering essentials, ensuring lifestyle, preparing for the unexpected and leaving a legacy. Once an advisor identifies, and a financial planning client aligns upon, a client’s objectives, the advisor recommends a solution set consisting of actions and offer products to address these objectives. In partnership with their advisor, a client then identifies what they determine to be an appropriate range and level of market risk. Our financial planning relationships with our clients are characterized by an ability to understand their specific needs, which enables us to help them meet those needs, achieve high overall client satisfaction and retention, hold more products in their accounts and increase our assets under management.
Our financial planning clients pay a fee for the receipt of financial planning services. This fee is based on the complexity of a client’s financial and life situation and his or her advisor’s experience. Some of our clients may elect to pay a consolidated, asset-based advisory fee for financial planning and managed account services and administration. If clients elect to implement their financial plan with our company, we and our advisors generally receive a sales commission and/or sales load and other revenues for the products that they purchase from us. These commissions, sales loads and other revenues are separate from, and in addition to, the financial planning and advisory fees we and our advisors may receive.
Brokerage and Other Products and Services
We offer our retail and institutional clients a variety of brokerage and other investment products and services.
Our Ameriprise ONE® Financial Account is a single integrated financial management brokerage account that enables clients to access a single cash account to fund a variety of financial transactions, including investments in mutual funds, individual securities, alternative investments, cash products and margin and securities-based lending.
We provide securities execution and clearing services for our retail and institutional clients through our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries. Clients can use our online brokerage service to purchase and sell securities, obtain proprietary and independent research and information about a wide variety of securities, and use self-directed asset allocation and other financial planning tools. We offer exchange traded mutual funds, 529 plans, public non-exchange traded real estate investment trusts, structured notes, private equity and other alternative investments issued by unaffiliated companies. We also offer trading and portfolio strategy services across a number of 
fixed income categories, including treasuries, municipals, corporate, mortgage- and asset-backed securities on both a proprietary and agency basis.
From time-to-time, Ameriprise may participate in syndicate offerings of closed-end funds and preferred securities. Syndicates are groups of investment banks and broker-dealers that jointly underwrite and distribute new security offerings to the investing public. Our clients may purchase for their own account the closed-end fund shares and preferred stock of such primary offerings in which we participate. In addition, qualified clients may purchase certain privately placed securities as distributed through Ameriprise.
Fee-based Investment Advisory Accounts
In addition to purchases of mutual funds and other securities on a stand-alone basis, clients may purchase mutual funds and other securities in connection with investment advisory fee-based account programs or services. We currently offer discretionary and non-discretionary investment advisory accounts. In a discretionary advisory account, we (or an unaffiliated investment advisor) choose the underlying investments in the portfolio on behalf of the client, whereas in a non-discretionary advisory account, clients choose the underlying investments in the portfolio based on their financial advisor’s recommendation. Investors in discretionary and non-discretionary advisory accounts generally pay a fee (for investment advice and other services) based on the assets held in that account as well as any related fees or costs associated with the underlying securities held in that account. A significant portion of our affiliated mutual fund sales are made through advisory accounts. Client assets held in affiliated mutual funds in an advisory account generally produce higher revenues to us than client assets held in affiliated mutual funds on a stand-alone basis because, as noted above, we receive an investment advisory fee based on the asset values of the assets held in an advisory account in addition to revenues we normally receive for investment management and/or distribution of the funds included in the account.
We offer several types of investment advisory accounts. For example, we sponsor (i) Ameriprise Strategic Portfolio Service (“SPS”) Advantage, a non-discretionary investment advisory account service, (ii) SPS - Advisor, a discretionary investment advisory account service, (iii) Ameriprise Select Separate Accounts (a separately managed account (“SMA”) program), a discretionary investment advisory account service through which clients invest in strategies managed by affiliated and non-affiliated investment managers, and (iv) Active Portfolios® investments, a discretionary investment advisory account service that offers a number of strategic target allocations based on different risk profiles and tax sensitivities. Additionally, we offer discretionary investment advisory account services (Vista Separate Accounts, Investor Separate Accounts and Access Separate Accounts) through which clients may invest in SMAs, mutual funds and exchange traded funds. We also offer a discretionary investment advisory account service as an accommodation program where client accounts are held and serviced by a third-party asset management provider and its affiliates.
Mutual Fund Offerings (Unaffiliated and Affiliated)
In addition to the Columbia Management family of funds (discussed below in “Our Segments - Asset Management - Product and Service Offerings - U.S. Registered Funds”), we offer mutual funds from approximately 160 unaffiliated mutual fund families representing more than 2,200 mutual funds on our brokerage platform and as part of our investment advisory accounts to provide our clients a broad choice of investment products. In 2018, retail sales of other companies’ mutual funds accounted for the substantial majority of our total retail mutual fund sales.
Mutual fund families of other companies generally pay us a portion of the revenue generated from the sales of those funds and from the ongoing management of fund assets attributable to our clients’ ownership of shares of those funds. These payments enable us to offer a broad and robust product set to our clients and provide beneficial client services, tools and infrastructure such as our website and online brokerage platform. We also receive administrative services fees from most mutual funds sold through our advisor network.
Insurance and Annuities
We offer insurance and annuities issued by the RiverSource Life companies (discussed below in “Business - Our Segments - Annuities” and in “Business - Our Segments - Protection”). The RiverSource insurance solutions available to our retail clients include universal life insurance, indexed universal life insurance, variable universal life insurance, traditional term life insurance and disability income insurance. RiverSource annuities include fixed annuities and fixed index annuities, as well as variable annuities that allow our clients to choose from a number of underlying investment options, including volatility management options, and to purchase certain guaranteed benefit riders. In addition to RiverSource insurance and annuity products, our advisors offer products of unaffiliated carriers on a limited basis, including variable annuities, life insurance and long term care insurance products issued by a select number of unaffiliated insurance companies. AFIG currently offers certain additional fixed and variable insurance and annuity products available only through the bank channel.
We receive a portion of the revenue generated from the sale of life and disability insurance policies of unaffiliated insurance companies. We are paid distribution fees on annuities sales of unaffiliated insurance companies based on a portion of the revenue generated from such sales and asset levels. These insurance companies may also pay us an administrative service fee in connection with the sale of their products.
Banking Products
We have changed our banking operations and products in recent years (as discussed above in “Business - History and Development”) and are in the process of rolling out a suite of banking products in connection with the conversion of Ameriprise National Trust Bank into a federal savings bank. Ameriprise Bank plans to eventually offer a set of core banking products, including checking and savings 
accounts, CDs, mortgage financing, home equity lines of credit, credit cards and debit cards, and pledged asset loans. This will include sweep deposits from its affiliate broker-dealer, AEIS, which offers the Ameriprise Insured Money Market Account (“AIMMA”), and Ameriprise Bank Insured Sweep Account (“ABISA”), an automatic “sweep” of available cash balances in its clients’ brokerage accounts into an FDIC-insured deposit account. We believe these products play a key role in our Advice and Wealth Management business by offering our clients an FDIC-insured alternative to other cash products. These products also provide pricing flexibility generally not available through money market funds. This suite of cash management products and capabilities will allow our clients to consolidate their assets into a single account with convenient access and flexible, high-quality service.
Ameriprise Bank's strategy and operations are focused on serving affiliated advisor clients. We will provide our banking products primarily through affiliated advisors. We believe that the availability of these products supports our financial advisors in their ability to meet the cash and liquidity needs of our clients. We also serve advisor clients through the Personal Trust Services division of Ameriprise Bank. Personal Trust Services provides personal trust, custodial, agency and investment management services to help meet estate and wealth transfer needs of individual and corporate clients of our affiliated advisors. Personal Trust Services also uses some of our investment products in connection with its services. Ameriprise Bank generally receives an asset-based fee for investment advice and other services based on assets managed, as well as related fees and costs.
Face-Amount Certificates
We issue different types of face-amount certificates through Ameriprise Certificate Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ameriprise Financial. Ameriprise Certificate Company is registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Investment Company Act”). Owners of our certificates invest funds and are entitled to receive at the end of a stated term or upon demand, a determinable amount of money equal to their aggregate investments in the certificate plus interest at rates we determine, less early withdrawals and related penalties, if applicable. For certain types of certificate products, the rate of interest is calculated in whole or in part based on any upward movement in a broad-based stock market index up to a maximum return, where the maximum is a fixed rate for a given term, but can be changed at our discretion for prospective terms.
At December 31, 2018, we had $7.9 billion in total certificate reserves underlying our certificate products. Our earnings are based upon the difference, or “spread,” between the interest rates credited to certificate holders and the interest earned on the certificate assets invested. A portion of these earnings is used to compensate the various affiliated entities that provide management, administrative and other services to our company for these products. In times of weak performance in the equity markets, certificate sales are generally stronger.
Financial Wellness Program
We provide workplace financial planning and educational programs to employees of major corporations, small businesses and school district employees through our Financial Wellness Program. In addition, we provide training and support to financial advisors working on-site at company locations to present educational seminars, conduct one-on-one meetings and participate in client educational events. We also provide financial advice service offerings, such as financial planning and executive financial services, tailored to discrete employee segments.
Strategic Alliances and Other Marketing Arrangements
We use strategic marketing alliances, local marketing programs for our advisors, and on-site workshops through our Business Alliances group to generate new clients for our financial planning and other financial services. An important aspect of our strategy is to create alliances that help us generate new financial services clients within our target market segment - the mass affluent and affluent, and increasingly those with $500,000 to $5,000,000 in investable assets. Our alliance arrangements are generally for a limited duration of one to five years with an option to renew. Additionally, these types of marketing arrangements typically provide that either party may terminate the agreements on short notice, usually within sixty days. We compensate our alliance partners for providing opportunities to market to their clients.
Our Segments - Asset Management
Our Asset Management segment provides investment management and advice and investment products to retail, high net worth and institutional clients on a global scale through Columbia Threadneedle Investments.
Columbia Management primarily provides products and services in the U.S. and Threadneedle primarily provides products and services internationally. As noted above, we refer to the group of companies in Ameriprise Asset Management Holdings GmbH and Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Sarl as “Threadneedle.” “Columbia Threadneedle Investments” refers to both Columbia Management and Threadneedle and reflects the global manner in which we think about and operate our asset management business in line with the Columbia Threadneedle Investments brand. We provide U.S. retail clients with products through unaffiliated third-party financial institutions and through our Advice & Wealth Management segment. We provide institutional products and services through our institutional sales force. Retail products for non-U.S. retail investors are primarily distributed through third-party financial institutions and unaffiliated financial advisors. Retail products include U.S. mutual funds and their non-U.S. equivalents, exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) and variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts. Institutional asset management services are designed to meet specific client objectives and may involve a range of products, including those that focus on traditional asset classes, separately managed accounts, collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), hedge fund or alternative strategies, collective funds and property funds. CLOs, hedge fund or alternative strategies and certain private funds are often classified as alternative assets. 
Our Asset Management segment also provides all intercompany asset management services for Ameriprise Financial subsidiaries. The fees for such services are reflected within the Asset Management segment results through intersegment transfer pricing. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management, Annuities and Protection segments. All intersegment activity is eliminated in our consolidated results.
Revenues in the Asset Management segment are primarily earned as fees based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by market movements, net asset flows, asset allocation and product mix. We may also earn performance fees from certain accounts where investment performance meets or exceeds certain pre-identified targets. At December 31, 2018, our Asset Management segment had $430.7 billion in managed assets worldwide.
Managed assets include managed external client assets and managed owned assets. Managed external client assets include client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia Threadneedle Investments fund families and the assets of institutional clients. Managed external client assets also include assets managed by sub-advisers we select. Our external client assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, although certain investment funds marketed to investors may be consolidated at certain times. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on consolidation principles. Managed owned assets include certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries) for which the Asset Management segment provides management services and receives management fees.

The investment management activities of Columbia Threadneedle Investments are conducted through investment management teams located in multiple locations, including Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, London, Malaysia, Minneapolis, New York, Menlo Park, Portland and Singapore. Each investment management team may focus on particular investment strategies, asset types, products and on services offered and distribution channels utilized. Within the global asset management business, we deploy our investment teams across multiple jurisdictions pursuant to sub-advisory and personnel sharing arrangements on an intercompany basis.
Our investment management capabilities span a broad range of asset classes and investment styles. The portfolios underlying our product and service offerings may focus on providing solutions to investors through one or more U.S. or non-U.S. equity, fixed income, bank loan, property, multi-asset allocation, alternative (including real estate and liquid alternatives) or other asset classes, and the strategies utilized in the management of such portfolios varies depending on the needs and desired outcomes or objectives of individual and institutional investors. We continually assess these capabilities to help ensure our ability to provide product and services offerings that are responsive to the evolving needs of our clients.
Product and Service Offerings
We offer a broad spectrum of investment management and advice and products to individual, institutional and high-net worth investors. In an effort to address changing market conditions and the evolving needs of investors, we may from time to time develop and offer new retail and institutional investment products with new and/or innovative investment strategies, including U.S. mutual funds and their non-U.S. equivalents, ETFs, separately managed accounts, hedge or alternative funds and other private funds, CLOs, and collective funds. Below is an overview of our Asset Management offerings.
U.S. Registered Funds
We provide investment advisory, distribution and other services to the Columbia Management family of funds. The Columbia Management family of funds includes retail mutual funds, exchange-listed ETFs and U.S. closed-end funds and variable insurance trust funds (“VIT Funds”). Retail mutual funds are available through unaffiliated third-party financial institutions and the Ameriprise® financial advisor network. VIT Funds are available as underlying investment options in variable annuity and variable life insurance products, including RiverSource® products. The Columbia Management family of funds includes domestic and international equity funds, fixed income funds, cash management funds, balanced funds, specialty funds, absolute return and other alternative funds and asset allocation funds, including fund-of-funds, with a variety of investment objectives. The Columbia Management family of funds also uses sub-advisers to diversify the product offerings it makes available to investors on its VIT Fund and retail mutual funds platforms. At December 31, 2018, our sponsored U.S. retail mutual funds, ETFs and U.S. closed-end funds had total managed assets of $138.4 billion in 151 funds. The VIT Funds that we sponsor and manage had total managed assets at December 31, 2018 of $68.4 billion in 70 funds.
Columbia Management serves as investment manager for most of our U.S. mutual funds as well as our exchange-listed ETFs and U.S. closed-end funds. Columbia Wanger Asset Management, LLC (“Columbia Wanger”), a subsidiary of Columbia Management, also serves as investment manager for certain funds, which are included in the totals noted in the preceding paragraph. In addition, several of our subsidiaries perform related services for the funds, including distribution, accounting, administrative and transfer agency services. Columbia Management and Columbia Wanger perform investment management services pursuant to contracts with the U.S. registered funds that are subject to renewal by the fund boards within two years after initial implementation, and thereafter, on an annual basis.
We earn management fees for managing the assets of the Columbia Management family of mutual funds based on the underlying asset values. We also earn fees by providing related services to the Columbia Management family of funds.
Non-U.S. Funds
Threadneedle offers a fund product range that includes different risk-return options across regions, markets, asset classes and product structures, which include retail funds that are similar to U.S. mutual funds. These funds are marketed to non-U.S. persons and the majority are often referred to as UCITS products (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities). UCITS and other funds offered by Threadneedle typically are structured as Open Ended Investment Companies (“OEICs”) in the UK, Société d'investissement à Capital Variable (“SICAVs”) in Luxembourg, as well as unit trusts. Threadneedle also sponsors, manages and offers UK property funds that invest in UK real estate. Many of our non-U.S. fund offerings are registered in and distributed across multiple jurisdictions. For example, our SICAVs are offered in many jurisdictions and are now our primary offering to investors outside of the UK and US. At December 31, 2018, our non-U.S. retail funds had total managed assets of $41.2 billion in 168 funds.
Threadneedle Asset Management Ltd. serves as investment manager for most of our non-U.S. fund products and earns management fees based on underlying asset values for managing the assets of these funds. Certain Threadneedle affiliates also earn fees by providing ancillary services to the funds. In addition, certain non-U.S. funds or portions of the portfolios underlying such funds may receive sub-advisory services, including services provided by both Columbia Threadneedle Investments personnel and other unaffiliated advisers.
Separately Managed Accounts
We provide investment management services to a range of clients globally, including pension, profit-sharing, employee savings, sovereign wealth funds and endowment funds, accounts of large- and medium-sized businesses and governmental clients, as well as the accounts of high-net-worth individuals and smaller institutional clients, including tax-exempt and not-for-profit organizations. Our services include investment of funds on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis and related services including trading, cash management and reporting. We offer various fixed income, equity and alternative investment strategies for our institutional clients with separately managed accounts. Columbia Management and Threadneedle distribute products of the other under the Columbia Threadneedle Investments brand, including Threadneedle’s offering various investment strategies of Columbia Management to non-U.S. clients and Columbia Management’s offering of certain investment strategies of Threadneedle to U.S. clients.
For our investment management services, we generally receive fees based on the market value of managed assets pursuant to contracts the client can terminate on short notice. Clients may also pay us fees based on the performance of their portfolio. At December 31, 2018, within our Columbia Threadneedle Investments asset management business we managed a total of $114.4 billion in assets under this range of services.
Management of Owned Assets
We provide investment management services and recognize management fees for certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as the assets held in the general account of our RiverSource Life companies and assets held by Ameriprise Certificate Company. Our fixed income team manages the general account assets to produce a consolidated and targeted rate of return on investments based on a certain level of risk. Our fixed income and equity teams also manage separate account assets. The Asset Management segment’s management of owned assets for Ameriprise Financial subsidiaries is reviewed by the boards of directors and staff functions of the applicable subsidiaries consistent with regulatory investment requirements. At December 31, 2018, the Asset Management segment managed $37.3 billion of owned assets.
Management of Collateralized Loan Obligations (“CLOs”)
Columbia Threadneedle Investments has a team of investment professionals who provide collateral management services to special purpose vehicles which primarily invest in syndicated bank loans and issue multiple tranches of securities collateralized by the assets of each pool to provide investors with various maturity and credit risk characteristics. For collateral management of CLOs, we earn fees based on the par value of assets and, in certain instances, we may also receive performance-based fees. At December 31, 2018, we managed $2.4 billion of assets related to CLOs.
Private Funds
We also provide investment management and related services to private, pooled investment vehicles organized as limited partnerships, limited liability companies or foreign (non-U.S.) entities. These funds are currently exempt from registration under the Investment Company Act under either Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) or related interpretative relief and are organized as U.S. and non-U.S. funds. These funds are subject to local regulation in the jurisdictions where they are formed or marketed. For investment management services, we generally receive fees based on the market value of assets under management, and we may also receive performance-based fees. As of December 31, 2018, we managed $6.8 billion in private fund assets.
Lionstone Investments, a subsidiary of Columbia Management, also serves as investment manager for certain private funds (in addition to separate accounts), which are included in the totals noted in the preceding paragraph.
Ameriprise Trust Company - Collective Funds and Separately Managed Accounts
Collective funds are investment funds sponsored by ATC (our Minnesota-chartered trust company); these funds are exempt from registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and offered to certain qualified institutional clients such as retirement, pension and profit-sharing plans. Columbia Management currently serves as investment adviser to ATC with respect to a series of ATC collective funds covering a broad spectrum of investment strategies for which ATC serves as trustee. ATC receives fees for its investment management services to the collective funds and Columbia Management receives fees from ATC pursuant to an agreement with ATC for the investment advisory services provided by Columbia Management. The fees payable to ATC and Columbia Management are generally based upon a percentage of assets under management. In addition to its collective funds, ATC serves as investment manager to separately managed accounts for qualified institutional clients.
As of December 31, 2018, we managed $6.4 billion of ATC Funds and separate accounts for ATC clients. This amount does not include the Columbia Management family of funds held in other retirement plans because these assets are included under assets managed for institutional and retail clients and within the “Product and Service Offerings - U.S. Registered Funds” section above.
Sub-advised Accounts
In addition, we act as sub-adviser for certain U.S. and non-U.S. funds, private banking individually managed accounts, common trust funds and other portfolios sponsored or advised by other firms. As with our affiliated funds, we earn management fees for these sub-advisory services based on the underlying asset value of the funds and accounts we sub-advise. For these accounts, we may also receive fees based on the performance of the underlying portfolio. As of December 31, 2018, we managed approximately $27 billion in assets in a sub-advisory capacity.
Distribution
We maintain distribution teams and capabilities that support the sales, marketing and support of the products and services of our global asset management business. These distribution activities are generally organized into two major categories: retail distribution and institutional/high net worth distribution.
Retail Distribution
Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. acts as the principal underwriter and distributor of our Columbia Management family of funds. Pursuant to distribution agreements with the funds, we offer and sell fund shares on a continuous basis and pay certain costs associated with the marketing and selling of shares. We earn commissions for distributing the Columbia Management funds through sales charges (front-end or back-end loads) on certain classes of shares and distribution (12b-1) and servicing-related fees based on a percentage of fund assets and receive intersegment allocation payments. This revenue is impacted by overall asset levels and mix of the funds.
Columbia Management fund shares are sold through both our Advice & Wealth Management segment and through unaffiliated third-party financial intermediaries, including U.S. Trust and Bank of America (from whom we acquired Columbia Management in 2010). Fees and reimbursements paid to such intermediaries may vary based on sales, redemptions, asset values, asset allocation, product mix, and marketing and support activities provided by the intermediary. Intersegment distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management Segment are eliminated in our consolidated results.
Threadneedle funds are sold primarily through financial intermediaries and institutions, including banks, life insurance companies, independent financial advisers, wealth managers and platforms offering a variety of investment products. Threadneedle also distributes directly to certain clients. Various Threadneedle affiliates serve as the distributors of these fund offerings and are authorized to engage in such activities in numerous countries across Europe, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region and Africa. Certain Threadneedle fund offerings, such as its UCITS products, may be distributed on a cross-border basis while others are distributed exclusively in local markets.
Institutional and High Net Worth Distribution
We offer separately managed account services and certain funds to high net worth clients and to a variety of institutional clients, including pension plans, employee savings plans, foundations, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, corporations, banks, trusts, governmental entities, high-net-worth individuals and not-for-profit organizations. We provide investment management services for insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries. We also provide a variety of services for our institutional clients that sponsor retirement plans. We have dedicated institutional sales teams that market directly to such institutional clients. We concentrate on establishing strong relationships with institutional clients and leading global and national consultancy firms across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Australia.
Our Segments - Annuities
Our Annuities segment provides RiverSource variable and fixed annuity products to individual clients. Our solutions in this segment and our Protection segment help us deliver on our Confident Retirement approach as well as provide certain products to unaffiliated advisors and financial institutions.
The RiverSource Life companies provide variable annuity products through our advisors, and our fixed annuity products are distributed through both affiliated and unaffiliated advisors and financial institutions. These products are designed to help individuals 
address their asset accumulation and income goals. Revenues for our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues for our fixed deferred annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on the RiverSource Life companies’ general account assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on general account assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities with a non-life contingent feature and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business. Revenues for our immediate annuities with a life contingent feature are earned as premium revenue. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of VIT Funds previously discussed (see “Business - Our Segments - Asset Management - Product and Service Offerings - U.S. Registered Funds,” above) under the variable annuity contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment. All intersegment activity is eliminated in our consolidated results.
Our annuity products include deferred variable and fixed annuities as well as immediate annuities. The relative proportion between fixed and variable annuity sales is generally driven by the relative performance of the equity and fixed income markets. Fixed sales are generally stronger when yields available in the fixed income markets are relatively high than when yields are relatively low. Variable sales are generally stronger in times of superior performance in equity markets than in times of weak performance in equity markets. The relative proportion between fixed and variable annuity sales is also influenced by product design and other factors. In addition to the revenues we generate on any fixed investment option available within our variable annuity products, we also receive fees charged on assets allocated to our separate accounts to cover administrative costs and a portion of the management fees from the underlying investment accounts in which assets are invested, as discussed below under “Variable Annuities.” Investment management performance is critical to the profitability of our RiverSource annuity business.
Variable Annuities
A variable annuity provides a contractholder with investment returns linked to underlying investment accounts of the contractholder’s choice. The underlying investment account options may include the VIT Funds previously discussed (see “Business - Our Segments - Asset Management - Product and Service Offerings - U.S. Registered Funds,” above), as well as variable portfolio funds offered through unaffiliated companies.
Contract purchasers can choose to add optional benefits to their contracts for an additional fee, including but not limited to, certain guaranteed minimum death benefits (individually, “GMDB”), a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (“GMWB”) and a guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit (“GMAB”). Approximately 99% of RiverSource Life's overall variable annuity assets include a GMDB and approximately 63% of RiverSource Life's overall variable annuity assets include a GMWB or GMAB. In general, these features can help protect contractholders and beneficiaries from a shortfall in death benefits, accumulation value or lifetime income due to a decline in the value of their underlying investment accounts.
The general account assets of the RiverSource Life insurance subsidiaries support the contractual obligations under the guaranteed benefit they offer (see “Business - Our Segments - Asset Management - Product and Service Offerings - Management of Owned Assets” above). As a result, we bear the risk that protracted under-performance of the financial markets could result in guaranteed benefit payments being higher than what current account values would support. Our exposure to risk from guaranteed benefits generally will increase when equity markets decline. Similarly, our guaranteed benefit reserves will generally increase when interest rates decline.
RiverSource variable annuities provide us with fee-based revenue in the form of mortality and expense risk fees, marketing support and administrative fees, fees charged for optional benefits and features elected by the contractholder, and other contract charges. We receive marketing support payments from the VIT Funds underlying our variable annuity products as well as Rule 12b-1 distribution and servicing-related fees from the VIT Funds and the underlying funds of other companies. In addition, we receive marketing support payments from other companies’ funds included as investment options in our RiverSource variable annuity products.
Fixed Annuities
RiverSource fixed deferred annuity products provide a contractholder with contract value that increases by a fixed or indexed interest rate. We periodically reset rates at our discretion subject to certain contract terms establishing guaranteed minimum interest crediting rates. Our earnings from fixed deferred annuities are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets purchased with fixed deferred annuity deposits and the rates at which interest is credited to our RiverSource fixed deferred annuity contracts. New contracts issued provide guaranteed minimum interest rates in compliance with state laws. Immediate annuity products provide a contractholder a guaranteed fixed income payment for life or the term of the contract.
Distribution
Our RiverSource Distributors subsidiary is a registered broker-dealer that serves both as the principal underwriter and distributor of RiverSource variable and fixed annuities through AFSI and as the distributor of fixed annuities through third-party channels such as banks and broker-dealer networks. Our advisors are the largest distributors of RiverSource annuity products, although they can offer variable annuities from selected unaffiliated insurers as well.
In 2018, we had total sales for fixed annuity products through third-party channels of $6 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had distribution agreements for RiverSource fixed annuity products in place with more than 110 third-party firms.
Liabilities and Reserves for Annuities
We maintain adequate financial reserves to cover the risks associated with guaranteed benefit provisions added to variable annuity contracts in addition to liabilities arising from fixed and variable annuity base contracts. You can find a discussion of liabilities and reserves related to our annuity products in Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K - “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”, as well as in Note 2, Note 11, Note 12 and Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Financial Strength Ratings
Our insurance company subsidiaries that issue RiverSource annuity products receive ratings from independent rating organizations. Ratings are important to maintain public confidence in our insurance subsidiaries and our protection and annuity products. For a discussion of the financial strength ratings of our insurance company subsidiaries, see the “Our Segments - Protection - Financial Strength Ratings” section below.
Our Segments - Protection
Our Protection segment provides a variety of products to address the protection and risk management needs of our retail clients, including life, disability income and property casualty insurance. These products are designed to provide a lifetime of solutions that allow clients to protect income, grow assets and give to loved ones or charity.
Life and disability income products are primarily provided through our advisors. Our property casualty products are sold primarily through affinity relationships. We issue insurance policies through our life insurance subsidiaries and the Property Casualty companies (as defined below under “Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance Products”). The primary sources of revenues for this segment are premiums, fees and charges we receive to assume insurance-related risk. We earn net investment income on owned assets supporting insurance reserves and capital supporting the business. We also receive fees based on the level of the RiverSource Life companies’ separate account assets supporting variable universal life investment options. This segment earns intersegment revenues from fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of VIT Funds under the variable universal life contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment. All intersegment activity is eliminated in consolidation.
RiverSource Insurance Products
Through the RiverSource Life companies, we issue universal life insurance, indexed universal life insurance, variable universal life insurance, traditional life insurance and disability income insurance. Universal life insurance is a form of permanent life insurance characterized by flexible premiums, flexible death benefits and unbundled pricing factors (i.e., mortality, interest and expenses). Variable universal life insurance combines the premium and death benefit flexibility of universal life with underlying fund investment flexibility and the risks associated therewith. Traditional life insurance refers to whole and term life insurance policies. Traditional life insurance typically pays a specified sum to a beneficiary upon death of the insured for a fixed premium. We also offer our clients various riders and alternatives, such as an accelerated benefit rider for chronic illness on our new permanent insurance products and a universal life insurance product with long term care benefits.
Our sales of RiverSource individual life insurance in 2018, as measured by scheduled annual premiums, lump sum and excess premiums and single premiums, consisted of 79% universal life, 19% variable universal life and 2% traditional life. Our RiverSource Life companies issue only non-participating life insurance policies that do not pay dividends to policyholders from the insurer’s earnings.
Assets supporting policy values associated with fixed account life insurance products, as well as those assets associated with fixed account investment options under variable insurance products (collectively referred to as the “fixed accounts”), are part of the RiverSource Life companies’ general accounts. Under fixed accounts, the RiverSource Life companies bear the investment risk. More information regarding the RiverSource Life companies’ general accounts is found under “Business - Our Segments - Asset Management - Product and Service Offerings - Management of Owned Assets” above.
Variable Universal Life Insurance
Variable universal life insurance provides life insurance coverage along with investment returns linked to underlying investment accounts of the policyholder’s choice. Investment options may include the VIT Funds discussed above, Portfolio Navigator and Portfolio Stabilizer funds of funds, an index-linked option, as well as variable portfolio funds offered through unaffiliated companies.
Universal Life Insurance and Traditional Whole Life Insurance
Universal life and traditional whole life insurance policies do not subject the policyholder to the investment risks associated with variable universal life insurance.
RiverSource universal life insurance products provide life insurance coverage and cash value that increases by a fixed interest rate. The rate is periodically reset at the discretion of the issuing company subject to certain policy terms relative to minimum interest crediting rates. Certain universal life policies offered by RiverSource Life provide secondary guarantee benefits. The secondary guarantee ensures that, subject to specified conditions, the policy will not terminate and will continue to provide a death benefit even if there is insufficient policy value to cover the monthly deductions and charges.
RiverSource indexed universal life insurance (“IUL”) provides lifetime insurance protection and asset growth through index-linked interest crediting. IUL is similar to universal life insurance in that it provides life insurance coverage and cash value that increases as a result of credited interest as well as a minimum guaranteed credited rate of interest.
We previously discontinued new sales of traditional whole life insurance; however, we continue to service existing policies. Our in force traditional whole life insurance policies combine a death benefit with a cash value that generally increases gradually over a period of years.
Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance provides a death benefit, but it does not build up cash value. The policyholder chooses the term of coverage with guaranteed premiums at the time of issue. During the chosen term, we cannot raise premium rates (even if claims experience deteriorates and it would then make sense to raise premium rates as a result). At the end of the chosen term, coverage may continue with higher premiums until the maximum age is attained, or the policy expires with no value.
Disability Income Insurance
Disability income insurance provides monthly benefits to individuals who are unable to earn income either at their occupation at time of disability (“own occupation”) or at any suitable occupation (“any occupation”) for premium payments that are guaranteed not to change. Depending upon occupational and medical underwriting criteria, applicants for disability income insurance can choose “own occupation” and “any occupation” coverage for varying benefit periods. In some states, applicants may also choose various benefit provisions to help them integrate individual disability income insurance benefits with Social Security or similar benefit plans and to help them protect their disability income insurance benefits from the risk of inflation.
Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance Products
We offer personal auto, home and umbrella insurance products through IDS Property Casualty and its subsidiary, Ameriprise Insurance Company (the “Property Casualty companies”). We offer a range of coverage options under each product category. Our Property Casualty companies provide personal auto, home and umbrella coverage to clients in 43 states and the District of Columbia.
Distribution and Marketing Channels
Our Property Casualty companies do not have field agents. We use a co-branded direct marketing strategy to sell our personal auto, home and umbrella insurance products through alliances with commercial institutions and affinity groups, and directly to our clients and the general public. We also receive referrals through our financial advisor network. Our Property Casualty companies’ multi-year contract with Costco Wholesale Corporation and Costco’s affiliated insurance agency expires on March 31, 2020. Costco members represented 93% of all new policy sales of our Property Casualty companies in 2018.
We offer RiverSource life insurance products almost exclusively through our advisors. Our advisors offer insurance products issued predominantly by the RiverSource Life companies, though they may also offer insurance products of unaffiliated carriers, subject to certain qualifications.
Reinsurance
We reinsure a portion of the insurance risks associated with our life, disability income, long term care (included in our Corporate & Other segment) and property casualty insurance products through reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurance companies. We use reinsurance to limit losses, reduce exposure to large and catastrophic risks and provide additional capacity for future growth. To manage exposure to losses from reinsurer insolvencies, we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers prior to entering into new reinsurance treaties and on a periodic basis during the terms of the treaties. Our insurance companies remain primarily liable as the direct insurers on all risks reinsured.
See Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on reinsurance.
Liabilities and Reserves
We maintain adequate financial reserves to cover the insurance risks associated with the annuity and insurance products we issue. Generally, reserves represent the present value of estimates of future benefits and claims that our insurance companies need to hold and applicable state insurance laws generally require us to assess and submit an opinion regarding the adequacy of our statutory-based reserves on an annual basis. For a discussion of the statutory-based financial statements related to our insurance products, see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Financial Strength Ratings
Independent rating organizations evaluate the financial soundness and claims-paying ability of insurance companies continually, and they base their ratings on a number of different factors, including market position in core products and market segments, risk-adjusted capitalization and the quality of the company’s investment portfolios. More specifically, the ratings assigned are developed from an evaluation of a company’s balance sheet strength, operating performance and business profile. Balance sheet strength reflects a company’s ability to meet its current and ongoing obligations to its contractholders and policyholders and includes analysis of a company’s capital adequacy. The evaluation of operating performance centers on the stability and sustainability of a company’s sources of earnings. The business profile component of the rating considers a company’s mix of business, market position and depth and experience of management.
Our insurance subsidiaries’ ratings are important to maintain public confidence in our protection and annuity products. We list our insurance subsidiaries’ financial strength ratings on our website at ir.ameriprise.com. For the most current ratings information, please see the individual rating agency’s website.
Our Segments - Corporate & Other
Our Corporate & Other segment consists of the long term care business and net investment income or loss on corporate level assets, including excess capital held in our subsidiaries and other unallocated equity and other revenues as well as unallocated corporate expenses.
Closed Block Long Term Care Insurance
Prior to December 31, 2002, the RiverSource Life companies underwrote stand-alone long term care (“LTC”) insurance. We discontinued offering LTC insurance as of December 31, 2002. A large majority of our closed block LTC is comprised of nursing home indemnity LTC or comprehensive reimbursement LTC. Generally, our insureds are eligible for LTC benefits when they are cognitively impaired or unable to perform certain activities of daily living.
Nursing home indemnity LTC policies provide a predefined daily benefit when the insured is confined to a nursing home, subject to various maximum benefit periods, regardless of actual expenses of the policyholder. Our older generation nursing home indemnity LTC policies were written between 1989 through 1999 and represent half of our policies. 
Comprehensive reimbursement LTC policies provide a predefined maximum daily benefit when the insured is confined to a nursing home covering a variety of LTC expenses including assisted living, home and community care, adult day care and similar placement programs, subject to various maximum total benefit payment pools, on a cost-reimbursement basis. Our second generation comprehensive reimbursement LTC policies were written from 1997 until 2002. 
Our closed block LTC was sold on a guaranteed renewable basis which allows us to re-price in force policies, subject to regulatory approval. Premium rates for LTC policies vary by age, benefit period, elimination period, home care coverage, and benefit increase option and are based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own claims and persistency experience. In line with the market, we have pursued nationwide premium rate increases for many years and expect to continue to pursue rate increases over the next several years. In general, since very little of our LTC business is subject to rate stability regulation, we have followed a policy of pursuing smaller, more frequent increases rather than single large increases in order to align policyholder and shareholder objectives. We also provide policyholders with options to reduce their coverage to lessen or eliminate the additional financial outlay that would otherwise result.
For existing LTC policies, RiverSource Life has continued ceding 50% of the risk on a coinsurance basis to subsidiaries of Genworth Financial, Inc. (“Genworth”) and retains the remaining risk. For RiverSource Life of NY, this reinsurance arrangement applies for 1996 and later issues only. Under these agreements, we have the right, but never the obligation, to recapture some, or all, of the risk ceded to Genworth.
For more information regarding LTC, see Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Corporate and Other.”
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive global industry. As a diversified financial services firm, we compete directly with a variety of financial institutions, including registered investment advisors, securities brokers, asset managers, banks and insurance companies. Our competitors may have greater financial resources, broader and deeper distribution capabilities and products and services than we do. We compete directly with these for the provision of products and services to clients, as well as for our financial advisors and investment management personnel. Certain of our competitors offer web-based financial services and discount brokerage services, usually with lower levels of service, to individual clients.
Our Advice & Wealth Management segment competes with securities broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers, financial planning firms, registered investment advisors, insurance companies and other financial institutions to attract and retain financial advisors and their clients. Competitive factors influencing our ability to attract and retain financial advisors include compensation structures, brand recognition and reputation, product offerings and technology and service capabilities and support. Further, our financial advisors compete for clients with a range of other advisors, broker-dealers, and direct channels. This includes wirehouses, regional broker-
dealers, independent broker-dealers, insurers, banks, asset managers, registered investment advisers and direct distributors. Competitive factors influencing our ability to attract and retain clients include quality of advice provided, price, reputation, advertising and brand recognition, product offerings, technology offerings, and service quality.
Our Asset Management segment competes on a global basis to acquire and retain managed and administered assets against a substantial number of firms, including those in the categories listed above. Such competitors may have achieved greater economies of scale, offer a broader array of products and services, offer products with a stronger performance record and have greater distribution capabilities. Competitive factors influencing our performance in this industry include investment performance, product offerings and innovation, product ratings, fee structures, advertising, service quality, brand recognition, reputation and the ability to attract and retain investment personnel. Furthermore, changes in investment preferences or investment management strategy (for example, “active” or “passive” investing styles), client or regulatory requirements on use of client commissions for research and downward pressure on fees presents various challenges to our business and may favor different competitors that focus more on “passive” investing styles. The ability to create, maintain and deepen relationships with distributors and clients also plays a significant role in our ability to acquire and retain managed and administered assets. The impact of these factors on our business may vary from country to country and certain competitors may have certain competitive advantage in certain jurisdictions. As an example, the timing and implementation of the British exit from the EU (commonly known as “Brexit”) and other regulatory or political impacts may ultimately favor certain types of asset managers in the EU.
Competitors of our Annuities and Protection segments consist of both stock and mutual insurance companies. Competitive factors affecting the sale of annuity and insurance products (including property casualty insurance products) include distribution capabilities, price, product features, hedging capability, investment performance, commission structure, perceived financial strength, claims-paying ratings, service, advertising, brand recognition and financial strength ratings from rating agencies such as A.M. Best.
Technology
We have an integrated customer management system that serves as the hub of our technology platform. In addition, we have specialized product engines that manage various accounts and over the years, we have updated our platform to include new product lines. We also use a proprietary suite of processes, methods and tools for our financial planning services. We update our technological capabilities regularly to help maintain an adaptive platform design that aims to enhance the productivity of our advisors to allow for faster, lower-cost responses to emerging business opportunities, compliance requirements and marketplace and cybersecurity trends.
We have developed and maintain a comprehensive business continuity plan that utilizes an all-hazards approach to cover different potential business disruptions to centrally controlled systems, platforms and facilities of varying severity and scope. This plan addresses, among other things, the loss of an entire geographic area, corporate buildings, staff, data systems and/or telecommunications capabilities regardless of their cause (e.g., flood, fire, terrorism or other denial or disruption of technology service). Our plan for cybersecurity incidents also provides a response framework for breach of data protection. We review and test our business continuity plan and data protection response manual periodically and update as appropriate. We require our key technology vendors and service providers that provide corporate-wide services and solutions to do the same. Additionally, we require our franchise advisors to create plans to cover such events for their locally controlled systems, data, staff and facilities.

At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 14,000 employees, including approximately 2,200 employee advisors (which does not include our franchisee advisors, who are not employees of our company, but includes advisors employed in the AAC and in our bank channel). We are not subject to collective bargaining agreements, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. In the United States and other jurisdictions, we have established and registered, or filed applications to register, certain trademarks and service marks that we consider important to the marketing of our products and services, including but not limited to Ameriprise Financial, Threadneedle, RiverSource and Columbia Threadneedle Investments. We have in the past and will continue to take action to establish and protect our intellectual property.
Regulation
Virtually all aspects of our business, including the activities of the parent company and our subsidiaries, are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations provide broad regulatory, administrative and enforcement powers to supervisory agencies and other bodies, including U.S. federal and state regulatory and law enforcement agencies, foreign government agencies or regulatory bodies and U.S. and foreign securities exchanges. The costs of complying with such laws and regulations can be significant, and the consequences for the failure to comply may include civil or criminal charges, fines, censure, the suspension of individual employees, restrictions on or prohibitions from engaging in certain lines of business (or in certain states or countries), revocation of certain registrations as well as reputational damage. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in our compliance processes, enhancing policies, procedures and oversight to monitor our compliance with the numerous legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business.
The regulatory environment in which our businesses operate remains subject to change and heightened regulatory scrutiny. Regulatory developments, both in and outside of the U.S., have resulted or are expected to result in greater regulatory oversight and internal compliance obligations for firms across the financial services industry. In addition, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding retirement investing as well as cybersecurity and privacy matters, and we will continue to closely review and monitor any legislative or regulatory proposals and changes. These legal and regulatory changes have impacted and may in the future impact the manner in which we are regulated and the manner in which we operate and govern our businesses.
The discussion and overview set forth below provides a general framework of the primary laws and regulations impacting our businesses. Certain of our subsidiaries may be subject to one or more elements of this regulatory framework depending on the nature of their business, the products and services they provide and the geographic locations in which they operate. To the extent the discussion includes references to statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to these statutory and regulatory provisions and is current only as of the date of this report.
In addition to the regulators summarized above, we are also subject to regulation by self-regulatory organizations such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), as well as various federal and state securities, insurance and financial regulators (such as regulatory agencies and bodies like the U.S. Department of Labor) in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions where we do business. Further, this summary includes the Board of Governors for the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) as they will supervise Ameriprise upon the conversion of Ameriprise National Trust Bank into a federal savings bank.
Advice and Wealth Management Regulation
Certain of our subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and with certain states, the District of Columbia and other U.S. territories. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are also members of self-regulatory organizations, including FINRA, and are subject to the regulations of these organizations. The SEC and FINRA have stringent rules with respect to the net capital requirements and the marketing and trading activities of broker-dealers. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries, as well as our financial advisors and other personnel, must obtain all required state and FINRA licenses and registrations to engage in the securities business and take certain steps to maintain such registrations in good standing. SEC regulations also impose notice requirements and capital limitations on the payment of dividends by a broker-dealer to a parent.
Our financial advisors are representatives of a dual registrant that is registered both as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) and as a broker-dealer. Our advisors are subject to various regulations that impact how they operate their practices, including those related to supervision, sales methods, trading practices, record-keeping and financial reporting. In addition, because our independent contractor advisor platform is structured as a franchise system, we are also subject to Federal Trade Commission and state franchise requirements. As noted earlier, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding retirement investing and financial advisors, including proposed rules, regulatory priorities or general discussion around transparency and disclosure in advisor compensation and recruiting, identifying and managing conflicts of interest and enhanced data collection.
Our financial advisors serve clients who hold assets in IRAs and employer-sponsored retirement plan accounts. The Department of Labor (“DOL”) published regulations in April 2016 that expanded the scope of who is considered an Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) fiduciary when providing investment advice to tax qualified accounts. Tax qualified accounts, particularly IRAs, make up a significant portion of our assets under management and administration. However, on March 15, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a decision vacating the DOL’s regulations in its entirety. The Fifth Circuit’s decision became effective when it issued its mandate on June 21, 2018. While the DOL’s fiduciary regulation has been vacated, the SEC has proposed its own best interest standard that would apply to recommendations made by financial advisors who work on a commission basis. Furthermore, several states have either issued their own fiduciary rules or are considering doing so and those rules may extend to certain types of products (e.g. insurance and annuities, financial planning, etc.) or may broadly cover all recommendations made by financial advisors. The Certified Financial Planner Board has updated its professional standards of conduct to include a fiduciary standard that applies to financial advisors who hold a Certified Financial Planner designation. Currently, Ameriprise has approximately 4,100 financial advisors that hold a Certified Financial Planner designation. In light of the various fiduciary rules and regulations that have been proposed or finalized, we continue to exert significant efforts to evaluate and prepare to comply with each rule.
Depending on the span and substance of any rules and regulations and timing of their applicability, the scope of any implementation could impact the way we compensate our advisors, particularly with respect to the sale of commission-based products, the access that representatives of affiliated and unaffiliated product manufacturers could have to our advisors and clients, and the manner and degree to which we and our advisors could have selling and marketing costs reimbursed by product manufacturers. We have incurred infrastructure costs in anticipation of compliance with these new regulations, and ongoing costs will be driven by how these regulations may evolve over the course of time. Other agencies, exchanges and self-regulatory organizations of which certain of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are members, and subject to applicable rules and regulations of, include the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the National Futures Association (“NFA”). Effective in August 2014, AFSI changed its registration from a Futures Commission Merchant to a Commodity Trading Advisor with the CFTC. In addition, certain subsidiaries may also be registered as insurance agencies and subject to the regulations described in the following sections.
Asset Management Regulation
U.S. Regulation
In the U.S., certain of our asset management subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers under the Advisers Act and subject to regulation by the SEC. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary duties, disclosure obligations and record-keeping, and operational and marketing restrictions. Our registered investment advisers may also be subject to certain obligations of the Investment Company Act based on their status as investment advisers to U.S. registered investment companies that we, or third parties, sponsor. As noted earlier, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding financial services in the U.S. through rules (and those yet to be implemented), regulatory priorities or general discussion around expanded reporting requirements and transfer agent regulation. This trend is also true globally. As one example, the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”), an international body that can make its own recommendations but not enact regulations, provided 14 policy recommendations to address what they see as the following structural vulnerabilities from asset management activities that could potentially present financial stability risks: (i) liquidity mismatch between fund investments and redemption terms and conditions for open-ended fund units; (ii) leverage within investment funds; (iii) operational risk and challenges at asset managers in stressed conditions; and (iv) securities lending activities of asset managers and funds. We believe many of the recommendations with respect to individual funds and firms outlined by the FSB are addressed by our existing robust risk management practices for our global asset management business, including with respect to liquidity risk management. However, any future regulations could potentially require new or different approaches which increase our regulatory burdens and costs.
Aspects of the regulation that would apply to our Advice & Wealth Management segment would also apply to our Asset Management segment. For example, Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. is registered as a broker-dealer for the limited purpose of acting as the principal underwriter and distributor for Columbia Management funds. Additionally, ERISA and the DOL’s fiduciary regulations (as well as state and other fiduciary rules, the SEC’s best interest standards or other similar standards) would be relevant to our global asset management business and we continue to review and analyze the potential impact of these regulations on our clients, prospective clients and distribution channels, as well as the potential impact on our business across each of our business lines.
In connection with rules adopted by the CFTC, certain of our subsidiaries are registered with the CFTC as a commodity trading advisor and commodity pool operator and are also members of the NFA. These rules adopted by the CFTC eliminated or limited previously available exemptions and exclusions from many CFTC requirements and impose additional registration and reporting requirements for operators of certain registered investment companies and certain other pooled vehicles that use or trade in futures, swaps and other derivatives that are subject to CFTC regulation.
Non-U.S. Regulation
UK Regulation
Outside of the U.S., Columbia Threadneedle Investments is primarily authorized to conduct its financial services business in the UK under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Threadneedle is currently regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”). FCA and PRA rules impose certain capital, operational and compliance requirements and allow for disciplinary action in the event of noncompliance. As with the U.S. environment, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding financial services outside the U.S. through rules (and those yet to be implemented). Key UK regulatory developments or trends include the following:

• | The UK financial service sector continues to face uncertainty over the final relationship with the EU as a result of Brexit. In the event of no arrangements as part of final negotiations, the UK would become a third country from the EU’s perspective (largely in the same way that the US is currently) which places restrictions on cross-border marketing of financial products. We continue to monitor developments in place and have an ongoing project to ensure we can continue to service our EU clients.


• | The FCA will extend the new accountability regime to almost all regulated firms in December 2019; this is an evolution of current requirements, with changes including: (i) a requirement that senior managers take all reasonable steps to prevent a breach in their area of responsibility, (ii) the introduction of a new ‘certified persons’ regime to replace the current system of “approved persons”; and (iii) nearly all employees being subject to enforceable conduct rules. Once implemented this will be an evolution of the FCA’s approach to conduct risk regulation.

As part of its Brexit planning, Columbia Threadneedle Investments has expanded the regulated permissions of its Luxembourg entity to become a “Super Manco”. This will allow clients to choose whether to contract with our EU-based business or UK-based business but will expose Columbia Threadneedle to greater scrutiny from the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (“CSSF”). We have added a handful of new employees to our Luxembourg-based team, primarily in risk, client management and oversight roles as part of this initiative.
Pan-European and Other Non-U.S. Regulation
In addition to the above, certain of our asset management subsidiaries, such as Columbia Threadneedle Investment’s UK and other European subsidiaries, are required to comply with pan-European directives issued by the European Commission, as adopted by EU member states. Certain of these directives also impact our global asset management business. For example, Columbia Threadneedle Investments and certain of our other asset management subsidiaries are required to comply with MiFID II, Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”), European Market Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) and the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive (“UCITS”). These regulations impact the way we manage assets and place, settle and report on trades for our clients, as well as market to clients and prospects. EMIR provides a framework for the regulation of over the counter and exchange-traded derivative markets, and is being implemented in a number of phases that began in August 2012 and is nearing completion. UCITS V amended the UCITS IV Directive and introduced changes relating to the depositary function, manager remuneration and sanctions for those funds that are publicly offered as UCITS products. UCITS V was implemented in March 2016. Similar to the developments in the U.S., we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding financial services through international markets, including in the European Union (“EU”) where we have a substantial asset management business. These non-U.S. rules (and those yet to be implemented), proposed rules, regulatory priorities or general discussions may impact us directly or indirectly, including as a regulated entity or as a service provider to, or a business receiving services from or engaging in transactions with, regulated entities. For example, within the EU and the UK we have been, or will be, addressing regulatory reforms including:

• | Brexit,


• | MiFID II,


• | FCA’s Asset Management Market Study,


• | Senior Manager and Certification Regime (“SM &CR”)


• | Solvency II,


• | Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (“PRIIPs”),


• | General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”),


• | Market Abuse Regulation (“MAR”),


• | Transparency Directive II (“TD II”),


• | UCITS V,


• | European Market Infrastructure Regulation II,


• | Fourth Money Laundering Directive (“MLDIV),


• | EU Benchmarks Regulation,


• | Money Market Fund Regulation (“MMFR”),


• | Insurance Distribution Directive (“IDD”),


• | Shareholder Rights Directive (“SRD”),


• | Investment Firms Review,


• | Securitisation Regulation,


• | Criminal Finance Act, and


• | The Review of the European Supervisory Authorities and new powers over delegation.

MiFID II came into effect on January 3, 2018. MiFID II is the most significant regulatory change EU investment firms have faced since the EU financial service action plan in 2006 which sought to establish the EU single market for financial services. MiFID II strengthens the requirement for investment firms to act in the client’s best interest, in many areas including conflicts of interest (specifically, inducements and a prohibition on free research), strengthening of best execution requirements and increased costs and charges disclosure, in relation to all services provided to clients. Firms are also subject to an increase in scope of transactions which must be reported to both the regulator and the market. In response to MiFID II, Columbia Threadneedle Investments has implemented wide ranging changes to systems, policies and operating procedures across its business including (i) increased transparency and reporting to our clients over costs impacting their investments; (ii) publishing detailed information on a near real-time basis for some trades, and reporting all transactions to the regulator the next business day; (iii) strengthening rules on requirements and reporting of best execution of our trades; and (iv) moving from clients paying for investment research as part of a bundled transaction fee to Columbia Threadneedle Investments paying for the research.
GDPR replaces the 1995 Directive on which the Data Protection Act of 1998 is based and which was inconsistently applied in the EU and did not fully contemplate developments in technology. GDPR seeks to harmonize data protection legislation and introduce changes in areas such as (i) governance and oversight; (ii) processing of personal data; (iii) enhancements around consent and data subject rights; and (iv) international data transfers. GDPR is a step change in the way personal data is regulated in Europe as well as outside of Europe to the extent that goods or services are being marketed to EU citizens and their personal information is collected and processed in the course of that interaction. GDPR became effective in May 2018, and our GDPR governance program is operating today. We are mindful of other upcoming regulatory change (including Brexit) and the data privacy impact that this will have on our current business model post-Brexit.
In March 2017, the UK invoked article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon in serving its relevant notice to leave the European Union on March 30, 2019. Having voted to leave the EU, the UK and others will need to negotiate the terms of multiple new relationships and this will take some time. The full impact of Brexit remains uncertain as there is a significant degree of uncertainty about how negotiations relating to the UK’s withdrawal and new trade agreements will be conducted, as well as the potential consequences and precise timeframe for Brexit. We already have an established fund range domiciled in Luxembourg (both UCITS and AIF) along with a UCITS Management Company. We are therefore well placed to continue to serve investors in Europe. We have replicated, and will continue to replicate, appropriate funds from our UK-based OEIC range within our Luxembourg SICAV platform. We have a well-resourced and experienced product development team with the capacity to ensure the needs of our clients are met in an efficient and transparent manner. Furthermore, we have expanded the regulated permissions of our Luxembourg entity as discussed above.
In Singapore, our asset management subsidiary Threadneedle Investments Singapore (Pte.) Ltd. (“Threadneedle Singapore”) is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) under the Securities and Futures Act. Threadneedle Singapore holds a capital markets services license with MAS, and employees of Threadneedle Singapore engaging in regulated activities are also required to be licensed. MAS rules impose certain capital, operational and compliance requirements and allow for disciplinary action in the event of noncompliance.
Threadneedle companies and activities are also subject to other local country regulations in Europe, Dubai, Hong Kong, the U.S., South Korea, South America and Australia. Additionally, many of our subsidiaries, including Columbia Management, are also subject to foreign, state and local laws with respect to advisory services that are offered and provided by these subsidiaries, including services provided to government pension plans.
Other Securities Regulation
Ameriprise Certificate Company is regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. As a registered investment company, Ameriprise Certificate Company must observe certain governance, disclosure, record-keeping, operational and 
marketing requirements. Ameriprise Certificate Company pays dividends to the parent company and is subject to capital requirements under applicable law and understandings with the SEC and the Minnesota Department of Commerce (Banking Division).
ATC is primarily regulated by the Minnesota Department of Commerce (Banking Division) and is subject to capital adequacy requirements under Minnesota law. It may not accept deposits or make personal or commercial loans. As a provider of products and services to tax-qualified retirement plans and IRAs, certain aspects of our business, including the activities of our trust company, fall within the compliance oversight of the U.S. Departments of Labor and Treasury, particularly regarding the enforcement of ERISA, and the tax reporting requirements applicable to such accounts. ATC, as well as our investment adviser subsidiaries, may be subject to ERISA, and the regulations thereunder, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to certain ERISA clients.
Protection and Annuities Regulation
Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by states and other territories where they are domiciled or otherwise licensed to do business. The primary purpose of this regulation and supervision is to protect the interests of contractholders and policyholders. In general, state insurance laws and regulations govern standards of solvency, capital requirements, the licensing of insurers and their agents, premium rates, policy forms, the nature of and limitations on investments, periodic reporting requirements and other matters. In addition, state regulators conduct periodic examinations into insurer market conduct and compliance with insurance and securities laws. The Minnesota Department of Commerce, the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance, and the New York State Department of Financial Services (the “Domiciliary Regulators”) regulate certain of the RiverSource Life companies, and the Property Casualty companies depending on each company’s state of domicile. In addition to being regulated by their Domiciliary Regulators, our RiverSource Life companies and Property Casualty companies are regulated by each of the insurance regulators in the states where each is authorized to transact business. Financial regulation of our RiverSource Life companies and Property Casualty companies is extensive, and their financial transactions (such as intercompany dividends and investment activity) may be subject to pre-approval and/or continuing evaluation by the Domiciliary Regulators.
Aspects of the regulation applicable to our Advice & Wealth Management segment would also apply to our Annuities and Protection segments. For example, RiverSource Distributors is registered with the CFTC and NFA as well as registered as a broker-dealer for the limited purpose of acting as the principal underwriter and/or distributor for our RiverSource annuities and insurance products sold through AFSI and third-party channels. Additionally, ERISA and the U.S. Department of Labor’s fiduciary regulations (as well as state and other fiduciary rules, the SEC’s best interest standards or other similar standards) are relevant to our insurance business and we continue to review and analyze the potential impact of these regulations on our clients, prospective clients and distribution channels, as well as the potential impact on our business across each of our business lines.
All states require participation in insurance guaranty associations, which assess fees to insurance companies in order to fund claims of policyholders and contractholders of insolvent insurance companies subject to statutory limits. These assessments are generally based on a member insurer’s proportionate share of all premiums written by member insurers in the state during a specified period prior to an insurer’s insolvency. See Note 24 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding guaranty association assessments.
Certain variable annuity and variable life insurance policies offered by the RiverSource Life companies constitute and are registered as securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As such, these products are subject to regulation by the SEC and FINRA. Securities regulators have recently increased their focus on the adequacy of disclosure regarding complex investment products, including variable annuities and life insurance products, and have announced that they will continue to review actions by life insurers to improve profitability and reduce risks under in force annuity and insurance products with guaranteed benefits.
The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), created the Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) within the Department of Treasury. The FIO does not have substantive regulatory responsibilities, though it is tasked with monitoring the insurance industry and the effectiveness of its regulatory framework and providing periodic reports to the President and Congress. We monitor the FIO’s activity to identify and assess emerging regulatory priorities with potential application to our business.
Each of our insurance subsidiaries is subject to risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements designed to assess the adequacy of an insurance company’s total adjusted capital in relation to its investment, insurance and other risks. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has established RBC standards that all state insurance departments have adopted. The RBC requirements are used by the NAIC and state insurance regulators to identify companies that merit regulatory actions designed to protect policyholders. The NAIC RBC report is completed as of December 31 and filed annually, along with the statutory financial statements. 
Our RiverSource Life companies and Property Casualty companies are subject to various levels of regulatory intervention should their total adjusted statutory capital fall below defined RBC action levels. At the “company action level,” defined as total adjusted capital level between 100% and 75% of the RBC requirement, an insurer must submit a plan for corrective action with its primary state regulator. The level of regulatory intervention is greater at lower levels of total adjusted capital relative to the RBC requirement. RiverSource Life, RiverSource Life of NY, IDS Property Casualty and Ameriprise Insurance Company maintain capital levels well in excess of the company action level required by state insurance regulators as noted below as of December 31, 2018:

Entity | Company Action Level RBC | | Total Adjusted Capital | | % of Company Action Level RBC
 | (in millions, except percentages)
RiverSource Life | $ | 675 | | | $ | 3,382 | | 501 | %
RiverSource Life of NY | 40 | | | 266 | | | 661 
IDS Property Casualty | 140 | | | 789 | | | 564 
Ameriprise Insurance Company | 1 | | | 49 | | | 7,887

Ameriprise Financial, as a direct and indirect owner of its insurance subsidiaries, is subject to the insurance holding company laws of the states where its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. These laws generally require insurance holding companies to register with the insurance department of the insurance company’s state of domicile and to provide certain financial and other information about the operations of the companies within the holding company structure.
As part of its Solvency Modernization Initiative, in 2010 the NAIC adopted revisions to its Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (“Holding Company Act”) to enhance insurer group supervision and create a new Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”) Model Act. The Holding Company Act revisions focus on the overall insurance holding company system, establish a framework of regulator supervisory colleges, enhancements to corporate governance, and require the annual filing of an Enterprise Risk Management Report. The ORSA Model Act requires that an insurer create and file, annually, its Own Risk Solvency Assessment, which is a complete self-assessment of its risk management functions and capital adequacy. These laws have now been enacted by the domiciliary states of RiverSource Life and the Property Casualty companies: Minnesota, New York and Wisconsin. The reports have been completed and filed as required by the laws and regulations of those states.
Federal Banking Regulation
Upon conversion of Ameriprise National Trust Bank into a federal savings bank, Ameriprise Bank will be a federal savings bank subject to regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"), which became the primary regulator of federal savings banks in 2011, and by the FDIC in its role as insurer of Ameriprise Bank's deposits. As a federally chartered bank, Ameriprise Bank will be subject to numerous rules and regulations governing all aspects of the banking business, including lending practices and transactions with affiliates. Ameriprise Bank will also be subject to specific capital rules and limits on capital distributions, including payment of dividends. If Ameriprise Bank's capital falls below certain levels, the OCC would be required to take remedial actions and could take other actions, including imposing further limits on dividends or business activities. In addition, an array of Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), fair lending, and other consumer protection laws and regulations will apply to Ameriprise Bank. Either of the OCC or the FDIC may bring administrative enforcement actions against Ameriprise Bank or its officers, directors or employees if any of them are found to be in violation of the law or engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice. 
As the controlling company of Ameriprise Bank, upon conversion of Ameriprise National Trust Bank into a federal savings bank, Ameriprise Financial will be a savings and loan holding company that is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the FRB. In connection with the conversion, Ameriprise Financial is electing to be classified as a financial holding company subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (as amended). Further, Ameriprise Financial will be subject to ongoing supervision by the FRB, including supervision and prudential standards, such as capital, liquidity and operational risk monitoring by management.
Under the Bank Holding Company Act, bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking. As a financial holding company, Ameriprise will be permitted to engage in other activities that the FRB has determined or in the future determines to be financial in nature, incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally, and to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities. Activities defined to be financial in nature include: providing financial or investment advice; securities underwriting and dealing; insurance underwriting; and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies, subject to significant limitations. They also include activities previously determined by the FRB to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Ameriprise may not, however, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of a bank holding company or a bank, without the prior approval of the FRB.
In order to maintain Ameriprise’s status as a financial holding company, Ameriprise Bank, as Ameriprise’s sole insured depository institution subsidiary, will need to remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” under applicable regulations, and must receive at 
least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the CRA. In addition, Ameriprise will need to remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company. Failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean, depending on the requirements not met, and any accord then reached with the FRB, that until cured Ameriprise Financial could not undertake new activities, continue certain activities, or make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies.
In connection with the conversion of Ameriprise National Trust Bank into a federal savings bank, we will be subject to what is commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule after a conformance period. The Volcker Rule prohibits “banking entities,” including us and our affiliates, from engaging in certain “proprietary trading” activities, as defined in the Volcker Rule, subject to exemptions for underwriting, market-making-related activities, risk-mitigating hedging and certain other activities. The Volcker Rule also prohibits certain investments and relationships by banking entities with “covered funds,” with a number of exemptions and exclusions. The Volcker Rule also requires that deductions be made from a BHC’s Tier 1 capital for permissible investments in covered funds. In addition, the Volcker Rule requires banking entities to have comprehensive compliance programs reasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with the Volcker Rule.
Additional Parent Company Regulation
Ameriprise Financial is a publicly traded company that is subject to SEC and New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) rules and regulations regarding public disclosure, financial reporting, internal controls and corporate governance. The adoption of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as well as the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act have significantly enhanced these rules and regulations. 
We have operations in a number of geographical regions outside of the U.S. through Threadneedle and certain of our other subsidiaries. We monitor developments in EU legislation, as well as in the other markets in which we operate, to ensure that we comply with all applicable legal requirements, including EU directives applicable to financial institutions as implemented in the various member states. Because of the mix of business activities we conduct, we assess the impact of, and monitor our status under, the EU Financial Conglomerates Directive, which contemplates that certain financial conglomerates involved in banking, insurance and investment activities among other things, implement measures to prevent excessive leverage and multiple leveraging of capital and maintain internal control processes to address risk concentrations as well as risks arising from significant intragroup transactions.
Privacy, Environmental Laws and USA Patriot Act
Many aspects of our business are subject to comprehensive legal requirements from a multitude of different functional regulators and law enforcement bodies concerning the use and protection of personal information, including client and employee information. This includes rules adopted pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act, an ever increasing number of state laws and regulations such as the New York State Department of Financial Services’ Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, EU data protection legislation as domestically implemented in the respective EU member states, and data protection rules in the other regions outside the U.S. and the EU in which we operate (including GDPR). We have also implemented policies and procedures, including a cybersecurity incident response manual, in response to such requirements. We continue our efforts to safeguard the data entrusted to us in accordance with applicable laws and our internal data protection policies, including taking steps to reduce the potential for identity theft or other improper use or disclosure of personal information, while seeking to collect only the data that is necessary to properly achieve our business objectives and best serve our clients.
As the owner and operator of real property, we are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. We periodically conduct environmental reviews on our own real estate as well as investment real estate to assess and ensure our compliance with these laws and regulations.
The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, commonly referred to as the USA Patriot Act, was enacted in October 2001 in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks. The USA Patriot Act broadened existing anti-money laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the United States substantially. In response, we enhanced our existing anti-money laundering programs and developed new procedures and programs. For example, we implemented a customer identification program applicable to many of our businesses and enhanced our “know your customer” and “due diligence” programs. In addition, we will continue to comply with anti-money laundering legislation in the UK derived from applicable EU directives and international initiatives adopted in other jurisdictions in which we conduct business.
