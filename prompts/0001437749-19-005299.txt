Item 1. Business
 
Ramaco Resources, Inc. is a Delaware corporation formed in October 2016. Our principal corporate offices are located in Lexington, Kentucky. We completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) on February 8, 2017 and our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “METC.”
 
As used herein, “Ramaco Resources,” “we,” “our,” and similar terms include Ramaco Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.
 
General
 
We are an operator and developer of high-quality, low-cost metallurgical coal in southern West Virginia, southwestern Virginia, and southwestern Pennsylvania. We are a pure play metallurgical coal company with 248 million tons of high-quality metallurgical coal reserves and advantaged geology leading to lower cash costs. Our near-term development portfolio includes four key assets: Elk Creek, Berwind, RAM Mine and Knox Creek.
 
We commenced initial production of metallurgical coal at our Elk Creek mining complex in late December 2016. During 2017, we developed and opened two deep mines and a surface mine at Elk Creek. During 2018, we opened one additional deep mine at Elk Creek. Additionally, we constructed and activated the Elk Creek preparation plant and rail load-out facility in late October 2017. We also began development mining at our Berwind property in late 2017 and continued our purchased coal program which augments our sales. Our aggregate production for 2018 was approximately 1.8 million clean tons of coal.
 
In 2017, we sold approximately 0.6 million tons of coal, including approximately 0.2 million tons of purchased coal. In 2018, we sold approximately 2.1 million tons of coal, including approximately 0.4 million tons of purchased coal.
 
On February 8, 2017, we completed the IPO of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File 333-215363), as amended and declared effective by the SEC on February 2, 2017. Pursuant to the registration statement, we registered the sale of 6,000,000 shares of $0.01 par value common stock, which included 3,800,000 shares of common stock sold by the Company and 2,200,000 shares of common stock sold by the selling stockholders.
 
Proceeds of our IPO, based on the public offering price of $13.50 per share, were approximately $51.3 million. After subtracting underwriting discounts and commissions of $3.6 million, and after deducting discounts and offering expenses paid directly by us, we received net proceeds of approximately $43.7 million. We used $10.7 million of the net proceeds to repay indebtedness owed to Ramaco Coal, LLC, an affiliated entity. The remaining proceeds of the IPO were used for general corporate purposes, including development of the Elk Creek mining complex. All units of our then-outstanding convertible Series A preferred units automatically converted into an aggregate of 12.76 million shares of common stock at the time of the IPO.
 
Metallurgical Coal Industry
 
Metallurgical coal is used to make metallurgical coke, a key ingredient in the steel-making process. Coke is used as a fuel and a reducing agent in a blast furnace during the smelting of iron ore into iron before it is converted into steel. Demand for coking coal in the U.S. is limited by the number of coke batteries. Annual U.S. metallurgical coal consumption is approximately 16 to 21 million tons per year. Any supply in excess of what can be consumed domestically is exported to buyers in North America, Africa, Europe, South America and Asia.
 
U.S. metallurgical coal production increased from 74 million tons in 2017 to 82 million tons in 2018, down from a peak of 91 million tons in 2011. U.S. metallurgical coal is primarily produced from underground mines located in the Appalachia coal regions. Metallurgical coal is transported by truck, rail (primarily Norfolk Southern or CSX), and barge to coke batteries located in the U.S. Metallurgical coal contracts in the U.S. frequently have one-year terms, although some buyers contract for shorter or longer terms. Domestic prices are historically not as volatile as international benchmark or indexed prices. Due to the modest but stable market for metallurgical coal consumption in the U.S., any supply in excess of what can be consumed domestically is exported.
 
The United States is the second largest seaborne exporter of metallurgical coal, behind Australia and ahead of Canada. The volume of metallurgical coal trading on the seaborne market (including Mongolian exports) was estimated to be 329 million metric tons in 2018, up 6% from 311 million metric tons in 2017. Australia is the dominant seaborne supplier and is expected to have accounted for approximately 54% of 2018 volumes, followed by the U.S. with approximately 17% of supply and Canada with approximately 11% of supply. U.S. metallurgical coal exports totaled 57 million tons in 2017 and 63 million tons in 2018. The United States has a geographic advantage over Australia and Canada in serving customers in the Atlantic Basin, primarily Europe and Brazil.

The metallurgical coal benchmark, which was traditionally negotiated quarterly between key Australian producers and key Japanese steel mills, has been replaced by utilizing a series of indices from a number of independent sources. Contracted volumes have terms that vary in duration from spot to one year, rarely exceeding one year. In some cases, indices are used at the point that the coal changes hands. In other cases, an average over time may be utilized. While the term “benchmark” is still utilized, it too is determined based on index values, typically for the preceding three months.
 
Seaborne metallurgical coal prices in 2016, 2017 and 2018 have seen significant volatility. In early 2016, a new Chinese policy that limited domestic coal miners to 276 work days a year resulted in a significant decrease in Chinese production and a resulting increase in seaborne demand, which increased prices from well below $100 per metric ton (“MT”) in early 2016 to over $300 per MT. A reversal of this policy in late 2016 caused prices to fall to the mid-$150s per MT. A subsequent cyclone that hit the center of metallurgical coal production and supply chain operations in Australia in early 2017 caused prices to briefly spike to near $300 per MT. Since mid-2017, metallurgical prices have remained strong, averaging just over $200 per MT. This is in part because the Chinese workday restrictions were replaced by a more permanent solution targeting smaller, less efficient, and generally higher cost mines for closure. Sxcoal noted that Chinese domestic met coal production was roughly flat in 2017, while falling 2% in 2018, despite strong pricing. As of March 7, 2019, metallurgical coal pricing was $215 per MT. 
 
U.S. metallurgical coal producers primarily sell coal to U.S. customers under calendar year contracts where both prices and volumes are fixed in the third or fourth quarter for the following calendar year. Export sales, on the other hand, are often done on a shorter-term (spot, quarterly or half-year) basis. Sales into the seaborne market tend to last for one year and have set volumes that reprice with the market by utilizing indexes.
 
Metallurgical coals are generally classified as high, medium or low volatile. Volatiles are products, other than water, that are released as gas or vapor when coal is burned. Carbon is what remains when the volatiles are released.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our business strategy is to increase stockholder value through sustained earnings growth and cash flow generation by:
 
Developing and Operating Our Metallurgical Coal Properties.   We have a 248-million-ton reserve base of high-quality metallurgical coal and four long-lived projects under development. Our initial project, Elk Creek, commenced production in late December 2016 and produced 548 thousand clean tons of metallurgical coal during 2017 and 1.8 million clean tons of metallurgical coal during 2018. We also initiated development mining at our Berwind mine. We plan to operate these mines at their optimum productivities and complete development of our remaining projects. Overall, we plan to grow production to more than 4.0 million clean tons of metallurgical coal over the next three to four years depending on the rate at which we are able to deploy capital. We may make acquisitions of reserves or infrastructure that continue our focus on advantaged geology and lower costs.
Enhancing Coal Purchase Opportunities. During 2018, we purchased approximately 0.4 million clean ton equivalents from third party producers. After washing at one of our coal preparation plants, we sold this tonnage to customers for our own account. Purchased coal is complementary from a blending standpoint with our produced coals or it may also be sold as an independent product.
 
Being a Low-Cost U.S. Producer of Metallurgical Coal.    Our reserve base presents advantaged geologic characteristics such as relatively thick coal seams at the deep mines, a low effective mining ratio at the surface mines, and desirable metallurgical coal quality. Furthermore, a majority of the coal seams being developed are accessible near, or above, drainage, thereby reducing up-front development costs. These characteristics contribute to a production profile that we believe will have a cash cost of production that is significantly below most U.S. metallurgical coal producers.
 
Maintaining a conservative capital structure and prudently managing the business for the long term. We are committed to maintaining a conservative capital structure with what we believe to be a reasonable amount of debt that will afford us the financial flexibility to execute our business strategies on an ongoing basis.
 
Demonstrating Excellence in Safety and Environmental Stewardship. We are committed to complying with both regulatory and our own high standards for environmental and employee health and safety.

Our Projects
 
Our properties are primarily located in southern West Virginia, southwestern Virginia, and southwestern Pennsylvania. The following map shows the location of our mining complexes and projects:
Elk Creek Mining Complex
 
Our Elk Creek mining complex in southern West Virginia began production in late December 2016. The Elk Creek property consists of approximately 20,552 acres of controlled mineral and contains 24 seams that we believe can be economically mineable. Nearly all our seams contain high-quality, high volatile metallurgical coal, which are accessible at or above drainage. Additionally, almost all of this coal is high-fluidity, which is an important factor in metallurgical coal.
 
We control the majority of the coal and related mining rights within the existing permitted areas and our current mine plans, as well as the surface for our surface facilities, through leases and subleases from Ramaco Coal, LLC. We estimate that the Elk Creek mining complex contains reserves capable of yielding approximately 96 million tons of clean saleable metallurgical coal.
 
We currently market most of the coal produced from the Elk Creek mining complex as a blended high volatile A/B composite. More recently we have chosen to segregate our high volatile A coals, so that they can be sold at a premium. Our market for Elk Creek production is principally North American coke and steel producers. We also market our coal to European, South American and Indian customers, and occasionally to coal traders and brokers for use in filling orders for their blended products. Additionally, we seek to market a portion of our coal in the specialty coal markets.
 
In 2017, we completed construction of a 700 raw ton-per-hour preparation plant at our Elk Creek mining complex. The plant has a large-diameter (48”) heavy-media cyclone, dual-stage spiral concentrators, froth flotation, horizontal vibratory and screen bowl centrifuges. We believe the preparation plant design and capacity will adequately support approximately 5.4 million raw tons of production or, approximately 2.2 million clean saleable tons (assuming a 41% plant yield). The existing and proposed Elk Creek mines are all within six miles of the preparation plant.
 
We also completed construction of the Elk Creek rail load-out in 2017. The rail load-out is a single-stage certified batch-weigh system capable of loading 4,000 tons per hour and a full 150-car unit train in under four hours. The load-out facility is served by the CSX railroad. We also have the ability to develop a rail-loading facility on the Norfolk Southern railroad, which would facilitate dual rail service. We have not undertaken any steps for development of a Norfolk Southern rail facility at this time.

The existing impoundment at Elk Creek is planned to be converted to a combined refuse facility in the future. The combined capacity is expected to provide approximately 20 years of disposal life for our operations. We completed construction of our plate presses to allow for dewatering material currently being pumped to our impoundment. This equipment will be utilized for a portion of the time in the near term and will ultimately process all waste material for placement in the combined refuse facility.
 
On November 5, 2018, one of our three raw coal storage silos that feed our Elk Creek plant experienced a partial structural failure. The prep plant at our Elk Creek mining complex was idled for approximately three weeks due to the partial structural failure of the silo. The silo was subsequently demolished and will not be replaced. In late November 2018, we completed a temporary conveying system at our Elk Creek mining complex. The temporary conveying system allowed us to bypass the damaged raw coal storage silo, which has since been demolished, and allowed for the immediate processing and shipping of coal at approximately 80% of the entire plant capacity, throughout December 2018. In February 2019, we completed the fabrication of a higher capacity bypass system to provide a secondary conveyance system, which operates at greater than 80% of processing capacity with increased reliability compared to the initial bypass system. We anticipate completion of rehabilitation work to the two remaining silos in the second quarter of 2019 at which point we expect the prep plant to return to full processing capacity. Our insurance carrier has disputed our claim for coverage based on certain exclusions to the applicable policy. We are still evaluating whether we will be fully insured against all losses or liabilities that could arise from this incident.
 
The Alma mine, our first mine at Elk Creek commenced production in late December 2016. The Eagle deep mine was completed and began production in mid-2017. Two additional mines, the #1 Surface and Highwall mine and the #2 Gas mine, were developed in the fourth quarter of 2017. All of our existing mines at Elk Creek are now operating at their full anticipated run rate.
 
A large portion of the controlled reserves are permitted through existing, issued permits. We currently have three mining permits that have not been activated and are actively pursuing multiple new permits.
 
Berwind
 
Our Berwind coal property sits on the border of West Virginia and Virginia and is well-positioned to fill the anticipated market for low volatile coals. Once we complete development mining, we expect to experience above average seam height. Development of our Berwind mining complex began in late 2017 with developmental production commencing in November 2017. Development mining will occur in the thinner Pocahontas No. 3 seam and advance to a point where that seam overlaps with the thicker Pocahontas No. 4 seam, lying approximately 65 feet above the Pocahontas No. 3 seam. We plan to drive a slope into the Pocahontas No. 4 seam, which will become the primary production seam. During 2018, we produced 0.1 million clean tons from the Berwind mine, and we expect to produce between 0.2 million and 0.3 million clean tons in 2019 from the Berwind mine. We estimate that the mine life for the Berwind mine is more than 20 years.
 
The Berwind property consists of approximately 31,200 acres of controlled mineral and contains a large area of Squire Jim seam coal deposits. The Squire Jim seam of coal is the lowest known coal seam on the geologic column in this region, and due to depth of cover has never been significantly explored. We have outcrop access to this seam at the top of an anticline.
 
We have the necessary permits for the Berwind mine for our current and budgeted operations. It’s anticipated that a permit for our Squire Jim seam room-and-pillar underground mine may be issued during 2019. At this point, we do not anticipate activating this mining permit.
 
Knox Creek
 
In July 2016, we acquired a preparation plant and coal-loading facility along with a refuse impoundment, an idle mine and surface and mineral properties at our Knox Creek operations. The Tiller Mine slope face-up and shafts are idle. We have recently explored the Tiller mine, which could provide access via our inter-seam slope to the Jawbone seam, which is the coal seam above the Tiller seam. We are continuing to evaluate the feasibility of a potential high volatile A metallurgical deep mine in the Jawbone seam of coal. We are currently developing a mine plan for the Jawbone seam, as well as seeking permit modifications that would allow us to mine the Jawbone seam from existing permits.
 
The Knox Creek property consists of approximately 61,343 acres of controlled mineral. In 2016, we began the purchasing and processing of coal from third parties in the Knox Creek preparation plant for sale for our own account. We also process and load coal trucked from our Berwind mine at this facility.
 
The Knox Creek facility is comprised of a 650 tons per hour preparation plant and loadout on site. Refuse is disposed of in an existing impoundment. Rail service is provided by Norfolk Southern.
 
During 2017 we purchased a number of leases near Knox Creek from various subsidiaries of The Brink’s Company and we leased additional reserves from a third party that abut both the Brink’s properties and our Knox Creek reserves. Two third-party producers sublease portions of these properties from us and their operations provide royalty income, as well as coal production, that could be purchased for resale to customers. We anticipate entering into additional leases and subleases of our reserves at Knox Creek with third parties.
 
 8


RAM Mine
 
Our RAM Mine property is located in southwestern Pennsylvania, consists of approximately 1,567 acres of controlled mineral and is scheduled for initial production in 2021. Production of high volatile coal from the Pittsburgh seam is planned from a single continuous-miner room-and-pillar underground operation. The Pittsburgh seam, in close proximity to Pittsburgh area coke plants, has historically been a key feedstock for these coke plants. Operation of our RAM Mine coal reserve may require access to a newly constructed preparation plant and loading facility, third party processing, or direct shipment of raw coal product. Upon commencement of mining, we anticipate that the mine will produce at an annualized rate of between 300 and 500 thousand tons with an estimated 10-year mining life.
 
We expect that coal from the RAM Mine coal reserve will be transported to our customers by highway trucks, rail cars or by barge on river systems. In addition to close proximity to river barge facilities, our RAM Mine operations are also near Norfolk Southern rail access.
 
The RAM Mine coal reserve is not yet permitted, although we have applied for a permit and it is in the final phase of the permit application process. We expect this permit to be issued in 2019.
 
Customers and Contracts
 
Coal prices differ substantially by region and are impacted by many factors including the overall economy, demand for steel, demand for electricity, location, market, quality and type of coal, mine operation costs and the cost of customer alternatives. The major factors influencing our business are the global economy and demand for steel.
 
We market to U.S.-based blast furnace steel mills and U.S.-based coke plants, in addition to international markets mostly in Europe, South America and Asia. When at full production, we also expect to market approximately 120,000 clean tons per year to specialty coal customers, such as foundry coke, activated carbon products, and specialty metal producers, for premium prices. We also plan to market up to 10% of our total production, virtually all from our surface mines, as thermal coal for sale to domestic utilities or as a specialty coal.
 
We sold 2.1 million tons of coal during 2018. Of this, 65% was sold to North American markets and 35% was sold into export markets. Principally, our export market sales were made to Europe. Our focus in 2018 was introducing the quality of our coal for use in coke ovens, which facilitated our participation at market pricing in the metallurgical coal domestic contracting season for shipments in 2019.
 
During 2018, sales to five customers accounted for approximately 63% of total revenue, with no single customer accounting for more than 15% of total revenue. The total balance due from these customers at December 31, 2018 was approximately 72% of total accounts receivable.  No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during this period. If a major customer decided to stop purchasing coal from us or significantly reduced its purchases from us, revenue could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
 
Safety Philosophy
 
We have a comprehensive health and safety program based on the core belief that all accidents and occupational illnesses are preventable. We believe that:
 

● | Business excellence is achieved through the pursuit of safer and more productive work practices. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Any task that cannot be performed safely should not be performed. 
● | Working safely is a requirement of our employees. 
● | Controlling the work environment is important, but human behavior within the work environment is paramount. 
● | Safety starts with individual decision-making—all employees must assume a share of responsibility for acts within their control that pose a risk of injury to themselves or fellow workers. 
● | All levels of the organization must be proactive in implementing safety processes that promote a safe and healthy work environment. 
● | Consequently, we are committed to providing a safe work environment; providing our employees with proper training and equipment; and implementing safety and health rules, policies and programs that foster safety excellence.

As we increase our work force, our safety program will include a focus on the following:
 

● | Hiring the Right Workers. We have established a hiring program that includes significant pre-employment screening and reference checks. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Safety Incentives. We have a compensation system which encourages and rewards excellent safety performance. 
● | Communication. We conduct regular safety meetings with the frequent involvement of senior management to establish the appropriate “tone at the top.” 
● | Drug and Alcohol Testing. We require pre-employment drug screening as well as regular random drug testing that exceeds regulatory requirements. 
● | Continuous Improvement Programs. We track key safety performance metrics, including accident rates, violation types and frequencies. We have developed specific targets in these areas and we measure performance against these targets. Specific action plans have been developed for targeted improvement in areas where performance falls below our expectations. 
● | Training. Our training program includes comprehensive new employee orientation and training, annual refresher training and task training components. These training modules are designed to reinforce our high safety expectations. Work rules and procedures are a key element of this training. 
● | Accident Investigation. We have implemented a structured accident investigation procedure that identifies root causes of accidents as well as actions necessary to prevent reoccurrence. We focus on near misses and close calls as a means of attempting to prevent more serious accidents from occurring. 
● | Safety Audits. We conduct periodic safety audits that will include work place examinations, including observation of workers at work, as well as safety program reviews. Both internal and external resources are utilized to conduct these audits. 
● | Employee Performance Improvement. A key element of our safety program is the recognition that safe work practices are a requirement of employment. We have implemented a program which identifies employee performance which is below expectations and develop specific action plans for improvement. 
● | Employee Involvement. We recognize that the key to excellent safety is employee involvement and engagement. We foster direct employee involvement in a number of ways including audit participation, accident investigations, as training resources and through solicitation of ideas in small group meetings and through anonymous workplace observation suggestion boxes.
● | Positive Reinforcement. We recognize that establishing safety as a core belief is paramount to our safety performance. As a result, we look for opportunities to celebrate accomplishments and to build pride in our operational safety and performance. 

Trade Names, Trademarks and Patents
 
We do not have any registered trademarks or trade names for our products, services or subsidiaries, and we do not believe that any trademark or trade name is material to our business. However, the names of the seams in which we have coal reserves, and attributes thereof, are widely recognized in the metallurgical coal market.
Competition
 
Our principal domestic competitors include Blackhawk Mining, LLC, Coronado Global Resources, Inc., Corsa Coal Corp, Arch Coal, Inc., Contura Energy, Inc., Warrior Met Coal, Inc., and Mission Coal, LLC. We also compete in international markets directly with domestic companies and with companies that produce coal from one or more foreign countries, such as Australia, Canada, Colombia and South Africa. Many of these coal producers are larger than we are and have greater financial resources and larger reserve bases than we do.
Suppliers
 
Supplies used in our business include petroleum-based fuels, explosives, tires, conveyance structure, ventilation supplies, lubricants and other raw materials as well as spare parts and other consumables used in the mining process. We use third-party suppliers for a significant portion of our equipment rebuilds and repairs, drilling services and construction. We believe adequate substitute suppliers and contractors are available and we are not dependent on any one supplier or contractor. We continually seek to develop relationships with suppliers and contractors that focus on reducing our costs while improving quality and service.
 
 10


 Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters
 
Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations, such as those relating to matters such as permitting and licensing, employee health and safety, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, water discharges, air emissions, plant and wildlife protection, the storage, treatment and disposal of wastes, remediation of contaminants, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects of mining on surface water and groundwater conditions. These environmental laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, SMCRA with respect to coal mining activities and ancillary activities; the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) with respect to air emissions; the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) with respect to water discharges and the permitting of key operational infrastructure such as impoundments; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) with respect to solid and hazardous waste management and disposal, as well as the regulation of underground storage tanks; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”) with respect to releases, threatened releases and remediation of hazardous substances; the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (“ESA”) with respect to threatened and endangered species; and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (“NEPA”) with respect to the evaluation of environmental impacts related to any federally issued permit or license. Many of these federal laws have state and local counterparts which also impose requirements and potential liability on our operations.
 
Compliance with these laws and regulations may be costly and time-consuming and may delay commencement, continuation or expansion of exploration or production at our facilities. They may also depress demand for our products by imposing more stringent requirements and limits on our customers’ operations. Moreover, these laws are constantly evolving and are becoming increasingly complex and stringent over time. These laws and regulations, particularly new legislative or administrative proposals, or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment could result in substantially increased capital, operating and compliance costs. Individually and collectively, these developments could have a material adverse effect on our operations directly and/or indirectly, through our customers’ inability to use our products. Certain implementing regulations for these environmental laws are undergoing revision or have not yet been promulgated. As a result, we cannot always determine the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations.
 
Due in part to these extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements and ever-changing interpretations of these requirements, violations of these laws can occur from time to time in our industry and also in our operations. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance are a major cost consideration for our operations and safety and compliance is a significant factor in mine design, both to meet regulatory requirements and to minimize long-term environmental liabilities. To the extent that these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, operating results will be reduced.
 
In addition, our customers are subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impacts associated with the combustion or other use of coal, which may affect demand for our coal. Changes in applicable laws or the adoption of new laws relating to energy production, greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and other emissions from use of coal products may cause coal to become a less attractive source of energy, which may adversely affect our mining operations, the cost structure and, the demand for coal. For example, if the GHG emissions rates or caps adopted under the CPP or proposed under its replacement are upheld or a tax on carbon is imposed, the market share of coal as fuel used to generate electricity would be expected to decrease.
 
We believe that our competitors with operations in the United States are confronted by substantially similar conditions. However, foreign producers and operators may not be subject to similar requirements and may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in or be subject to similar limitations on their operations. As a result, the costs and operating restrictions necessary for compliance with United States environmental laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our competitive position with regard to those foreign competitors. The specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, applicable legislation and its production methods.
 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act
 
SMCRA establishes operational, reclamation and closure standards for our mining operations and requires that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of and following completion of mining activities. SMCRA also stipulates compliance with many other major environmental statutes, including the CAA, the CWA, the ESA, RCRA and CERCLA. Permits for all mining operations must be obtained from the United States Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (“OSMRE”) or, where state regulatory agencies have adopted federally approved state programs under SMCRA, the appropriate state regulatory authority. Our operations are located in states which have achieved primary jurisdiction for enforcement of SMCRA through approved state programs.
 
SMCRA imposes a complex set of requirements covering all facets of coal mining. SMCRA regulations govern, among other things, coal prospecting, mine plan development, topsoil or growth medium removal and replacement, disposal of excess spoil and coal refuse, protection of the hydrologic balance, and suitable post mining land uses.
 
 11


From time to time, OSMRE will also update its mining regulations under SMCRA. For example, in December 2016, OSMRE finalized a new version of the Stream Protection Rule which was to become effective in January 2017. The rule would have impacted both surface and underground mining operations, as it would have imposed stricter guidelines on conducting coal mining operations, and would have required more extensive baseline data on hydrology, geology and aquatic biology in permit applications. The rule also required the collection of increased pre-mining data about the site of the proposed mining operation and adjacent areas to establish a baseline for evaluation of the impacts of mining and the effectiveness of reclamation associated with returning streams to pre-mining conditions. However, in February 2017, both the House and Senate passed a resolution disapproving of the Stream Protection Rule pursuant to the Congressional Review Act (“CRA”). President Trump signed the resolution on February 16, 2017 and, pursuant to the CRA, the Stream Protection Rule “shall have no force or effect” and cannot be replaced by a similar rule absent future legislation. On November 17, 2017, OSMRE published a Federal Register notice that removed the text of the Stream Protection Rule from the Code of Federal Regulations. Whether Congress will enact future legislation to require a new Stream Protection Rule remains uncertain. The existing rules, or other new SMCRA regulations, could result in additional material costs, obligations and restrictions upon our operations.
 
Abandoned Mine Lands Fund
 
SMCRA also imposes a reclamation fee on all current mining operations, the proceeds of which are deposited in the AML Fund, which is used to restore unreclaimed and abandoned mine lands mined before 1977. The current per ton fee is $0.28 per ton for surface-mined coal and $0.12 per ton for underground-mined coal. These fees are currently scheduled to be in effect until September 30, 2021. Estimates of our total reclamation and mine-closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and our experience related to similar activities. If these accruals are insufficient or our liability in a particular year is greater than currently anticipated, our future operating results could be adversely affected.
Mining Permits and Approvals
 
Numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations. We are required to prepare and present to federal, state, and local authorities data detailing the effect or impact that any proposed exploration project for production of coal may have upon the environment, the public and our employees. The permitting rules, and the interpretations of these rules, are complex, change frequently, and may be subject to discretionary interpretations by regulators. The requirements imposed by these permits and associated regulations can be costly and time-consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration, production or expansion at our operations. The governing laws, rules, and regulations authorize substantial fines and penalties, including revocation or suspension of mining permits under some circumstances. Monetary sanctions and, in certain circumstances, even criminal sanctions may be imposed for failure to comply with these laws.
 
Applications for permits and permit renewals at our mining operations are also subject to public comment and potential legal challenges from third parties seeking to prevent a permit from being issued, or to overturn the applicable agency’s grant of the permit. Should our permitting efforts become subject to such challenges, they could delay commencement, continuation or expansion of our mining operations. For example, non-governmental organizations and certain private individuals have submitted comments to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection asserting that there are deficiencies in our permit application for RAM No. 1 mine. The permit application is administratively complete but has not yet received approval. If such comments lead to a formal challenge to the issuance of these permits, the permits may not be issued in a timely fashion, may involve requirements which restrict our ability to conduct our mining operations or to do so profitably, or may not be issued at all. Any delays, denials, or revocation of these or other similar permits we need to operate could reduce our production and materially adversely impact our cash flow and results of our operations.
 
In order to obtain mining permits and approvals from state regulatory authorities, mine operators must also submit a reclamation plan for restoring the mined property to its prior condition, productive use or other permitted condition. The conditions of certain permits also require that we obtain surface owner consent if the surface estate has been split from the mineral estate. This requires us to negotiate with third parties for surface access that overlies coal we acquired or intend to acquire. These negotiations can be costly and time-consuming, lasting years in some instances, which can create additional delays in the permitting process. If we cannot successfully negotiate for land access, we could be denied a permit to mine coal we already own.
 
Finally, we typically submit necessary mining permit applications several months, or even years, before we anticipate mining a new area. However, we cannot control the pace at which the government issues permits needed for new or ongoing operations. For example, the process of obtaining CWA permits can be particularly time-consuming and subject to delays and denials. The EPA also has the authority to veto permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the "Corps") under the CWA’s Section 404 program that prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill material into regulated waters without a permit. Even after we obtain the permits that we need to operate, many of the permits must be periodically renewed, or may require modification. There is some risk that not all existing permits will be approved for renewal, or that existing permits will be approved for renewal only upon terms that restrict or limit our operations in ways that may be material.

Financial Assurance
 
Federal and state laws require a mine operator to secure the performance of its reclamation and lease obligations under SMCRA through the use of surety bonds or other approved forms of financial security for payment of certain long-term obligations, including mine closure or reclamation costs. The changes in the market for coal used to generate electricity in recent years have led to bankruptcies involving prominent coal producers. Several of these companies relied on self-bonding to guarantee their responsibilities under the SMCRA permits including for reclamation. In response to these bankruptcies, OSMRE issued a Policy Advisory in August 2016 to state agencies that are authorized under the SMCRA to implement the act in their states. Certain states, including Virginia, had previously announced that it would no longer accept self-bonding to secure reclamation obligations under the state mining laws. This Policy Advisory is intended to discourage authorized states from approving self-bonding arrangements and may lead to increased demand for other forms of financial assurance, which may strain capacity for those instruments and increase our costs of obtaining and maintaining the amounts of financial assurance needed for our operations. In addition, OSMRE announced in August 2016 that it would initiate a rulemaking under SMCRA to revise the requirements for self-bonding. Individually and collectively, these revised various financial assurance requirements may increase the amount of financial assurance needed and limit the types of acceptable instruments, straining the capacity of the surety markets to meet demand. This may delay the timing for and increase the costs of obtaining the required financial assurance.
 
We use surety bonds, trusts and letters of credit to provide financial assurance for certain transactions and business activities. Federal and state laws require us to obtain surety bonds to secure payment of certain long-term obligations including mine closure or reclamation costs and other miscellaneous obligations. The bonds are renewable on a yearly basis. Surety bond rates have increased in recent years and the market terms of such bonds have generally become less favorable. Sureties typically require coal producers to post collateral, often having a value equal to 40% or more of the face amount of the bond. As a result, we may be required to provide collateral, letters of credit or other assurances of payment in order to obtain the necessary types and amounts of financial assurance. Under our surety bonding program, we are not currently required to post any letters of credit or other collateral to secure the surety bonds; obtaining letters of credit in lieu of surety bonds could result in a significant cost increase. Moreover, the need to obtain letters of credit may also reduce amounts that we can borrow under any senior secured credit facility for other purposes. If, in the future, we are unable to secure surety bonds for these obligations and are forced to secure letters of credit indefinitely or obtain some other form of financial assurance at too high of a cost, our profitability may be negatively affected.
 
We intend to maintain a credit profile that eliminates the need to post collateral for our surety bonds. Nonetheless, our surety has the right to demand additional collateral at its discretion.
 
Some international customers require new suppliers to post performance guarantees during the initial stages of qualifying to become a long-term supplier. To date we have not had to provide a performance guarantee, but it is possible that such a guarantee could be required during 2019.
 
Mine Safety and Health
 
The Mine Act and the MINER Act, and regulations issued under these federal statutes, impose stringent health and safety standards on mining operations. The regulations that have been adopted under the Mine Act and the MINER Act are comprehensive and affect numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining procedures, roof control, ventilation, blasting, use and maintenance of mining equipment, dust and noise control, communications, emergency response procedures, and other matters. MSHA regularly inspects mines to ensure compliance with regulations promulgated under the Mine Act and MINER Act.
 
From time to time MSHA will also publish new regulations imposing additional requirements and costs on our operations. For example, MSHA implemented a rule in August 2014 to lower miners’ exposure to respirable coal mine dust. The rule requires shift dust to be monitored and reduces the respirable dust standard for designated occupants and miners. MSHA also finalized a new rule in January 2015 on proximity detection systems for continuous mining machines, which requires underground coal mine operators to equip continuous mining machines, except full-face continuous mining machines, with proximity detection systems.
 
Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Virginia all have similar programs for mine safety and health regulation and enforcement. The various requirements mandated by federal and state statutes, rules, and regulations place restrictions on our methods of operation and result in fees and civil penalties for violations of such requirements or criminal liability for the knowing violation of such standards, significantly impacting operating costs and productivity.
 
The regulations enacted under the Mine Act and MINER Act as well as under similar state acts are routinely expanded or made more stringent, raising compliance costs and increasing potential liability. Our compliance with current or future mine health and safety regulations could increase our mining costs. At this time, it is not possible to predict the full effect that new or proposed statutes, regulations and policies will have on our operating costs, but any expansion of existing regulations, or making such regulations more stringent may have a negative impact on the profitability of our operations. If we were to be found in violation of mine safety and health regulations, we could face penalties or restrictions that may materially and adversely impact our operations, financial results and liquidity.
 
In addition, government inspectors have the authority to issue orders to shut down our operations based on safety considerations under certain circumstances, such as imminent dangers, accidents, failures to abate violations, and unwarrantable failures to comply with mandatory safety standards. If an incident were to occur at one of our operations, it could be shut down for an extended period of time, and our reputation with prospective customers could be materially damaged. Moreover, if one of our operations is issued a notice of pattern of violations, then MSHA can issue an order withdrawing the miners from the area affected by any enforcement action during each subsequent significant and substantial (“S&S”) citation until the S&S citation or order is abated. In 2013 MSHA modified the pattern of violations regulation, allowing, among other things, the use of non-final citations and orders in determining whether a pattern of violations exists at a mine.

Workers’ Compensation and Black Lung
 
We are insured for workers’ compensation benefits for work related injuries that occur within our United States operations. We retain first-dollar coverage for all of our subsidiaries and are insured for the statutory limits. Workers’ compensation liabilities, including those related to claims incurred but not reported, are recorded principally using annual valuations based on discounted future expected payments using historical data of the operating subsidiary or combined insurance industry data when historical data is limited. State workers’ compensation acts typically provide for an exception to an employer’s immunity from civil lawsuits for workplace injuries in the case of intentional torts. However, West Virginia’s workers’ compensation act provides a much broader exception to workers’ compensation immunity. The exception allows an injured employee to recover against his or her employer where he or she can show damages caused by an unsafe working condition of which the employer was aware that was a violation of a statute, regulation, rule or consensus industry standard. These types of lawsuits are not uncommon and could have a significant impact on our operating costs.
 
In addition, we obtained from a third-party insurer a workers’ compensation insurance policy, which includes coverage for medical and disability benefits for black lung disease under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 and the Mine Act, as amended. Under the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 and the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, as amended in 1981, each coal mine operator must pay federal black lung benefits to claimants who are current and former employees and also make payments to a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants who last worked in the coal industry prior to January 1, 1970.
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes significant changes to the federal black lung program including an automatic survivor benefit paid upon the death of a miner with an awarded black lung claim and the establishment of a rebuttable presumption with regard to pneumoconiosis among miners with 15 or more years of coal mine employment that are totally disabled by a respiratory condition. These changes could have a material impact on our costs expended in association with the federal black lung program. In addition to possibly incurring liability under federal statutes, we may also be liable under state laws for black lung claims.
 
Clean Air Act
 
The CAA and comparable state laws that regulate air emissions affect coal mining operations both directly and indirectly. Direct impacts on coal mining and processing operations include CAA permitting requirements and emission control requirements relating to air pollutants, including particulate matter such as fugitive dust. The CAA indirectly affects coal mining operations by extensively regulating the emissions of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury and other compounds emitted by coal-fired power plants. In addition to the GHG issues discussed below, the air emissions programs that may materially and adversely affect our operations, financial results, liquidity, and demand for our coal, directly or indirectly, include, but are not limited to, the following:

● | Clean Air Interstate Rule and Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. The Clean Air Interstate Rule (“CAIR”) calls for power plants in 28 states and the District of Columbia to reduce emission levels of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pursuant to a cap-and-trade program similar to the system now in effect for acid rain. In June 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (“CSAPR”), a replacement rule to CAIR, which requires 28 states in the Midwest and eastern seaboard of the U.S. to reduce power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ozone and/or fine particle pollution in other states. Following litigation over the rule, the EPA issued an interim final rule reconciling the CSAPR rule with a court order, which calls for Phase 1 implementation of CSAPR in 2015 and Phase 2 implementation in 2017. In September 2016, the EPA finalized an update to CSAPR for the 2008 ozone NAAQS by issuing the final CSAPR Update. Beginning in May 2017, the CSAPR Update further limited summertime (May-September) nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants in 22 states in the eastern United States. For states to meet their requirements under CSAPR, a number of coal-fired electric generating units will likely need to be retired, rather than retrofitted with the necessary emission control technologies, reducing demand for thermal coal. However, the practical impact of CSAPR may be limited because utilities in the U.S. have continued to take steps to comply with CAIR, which requires similar power plant emissions reductions, and because utilities are preparing to comply with the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (“MATS”) regulations, which require overlapping power plant emissions reductions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Acid Rain. Title IV of the CAA requires reductions of sulfur dioxide emissions by electric utilities and applies to all coal-fired power plants generating greater than 25 Megawatts of power. Affected power plants have sought to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by switching to lower sulfur fuels, installing pollution control devices, reducing electricity generating levels or purchasing or trading sulfur dioxide emission allowances. These reductions could impact our customers in the electric generation industry. These requirements are not supplanted by CSAPR. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | NAAQS for Criterion Pollutants. The CAA requires the EPA to set standards, referred to as NAAQS, for six common air pollutants: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, lead, ozone, particulate matter and sulfur dioxide. Areas that are not in compliance (referred to as non-attainment areas) with these standards must take steps to reduce emissions levels. The EPA has adopted more stringent NAAQS for nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and ozone. As a result, some states will be required to amend their existing individual state implementation plans (“SIPs”) to achieve compliance with the new air quality standards. Other states will be required to develop new plans for areas that were previously in “attainment,” but do not meet the revised standards. For example, in October 2015, the EPA finalized the NAAQS for ozone pollution and reduced the limit to 70 parts per billion (ppb) from the previous 75 ppb standard. Under the revised ozone NAAQS, significant additional emissions control expenditures may be required at coal-fired power plants. The final rules and new standards may impose additional emissions control requirements on our customers in the electric generation, steelmaking, and coke industries. Because coal mining operations emit particulate matter and sulfur dioxide, our mining operations could be affected when the new standards are implemented by the states.
● | Nitrogen Oxide SIP Call. The nitrogen oxide SIP Call program was established by the EPA in October 1998 to reduce the transport of nitrogen oxide and ozone on prevailing winds from the Midwest and South to states in the Northeast, which alleged that they could not meet federal air quality standards because of migrating pollution. The program is designed to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by one million tons per year in 22 eastern states and the District of Columbia. As a result of the program, many power plants have been or will be required to install additional emission control measures, such as selective catalytic reduction devices. Installation of additional emission control measures will make it more costly to operate coal-fired power plants, potentially making coal a less attractive fuel. 
● | Mercury and Hazardous Air Pollutants. In February 2012, the EPA formally adopted the MATS rule to regulate emissions of mercury and other metals, fine particulates, and acid gases such as hydrogen chloride from coal- and oil-fired power plants. Following a legal challenge to MATS, the EPA issued a new determination in April 2016 that it is appropriate and necessary to regulate these pollutants from power plants. In December 2018, the EPA proposed a rule that would reverse its determination that it is appropriate and necessary to regulate these pollutants. However, as proposed, this rule would not alter or eliminate the emissions standards established by the MATS rule. Like CSAPR, MATS and other similar future regulations could accelerate the retirement of a significant number of coal-fired power plants. Such retirements would likely adversely impact our business. 

Global Climate Change
 
Climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. There is widespread concern about the contributions of human activity to such changes, especially through the emission of GHGs. There are three primary sources of GHGs associated with the coal industry. First, the end use of our coal by our customers in electricity generation, coke plants, and steelmaking is a source of GHGs. Second, combustion of fuel by equipment used in coal production and to transport our coal to our customers is a source of GHGs. Third, coal mining itself can release methane, which is considered to be a more potent GHG than CO2, directly into the atmosphere. These emissions from coal consumption, transportation and production are subject to pending and proposed regulation as part of initiatives to address global climate change.
 
As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs. Collectively, these initiatives could result in higher electric costs to our customers or lower the demand for coal used in electric generation, which could in turn adversely impact our business.
 
At present, we are principally focused on metallurgical coal production, which is not used in connection with the production of power generation. However, we may seek to sell greater amounts of our coal into the power-generation market in the future. The market for our coal may be adversely impacted if comprehensive legislation or regulations focusing on GHG emission reductions are adopted, or if our customers are unable to obtain financing for their operations.

At the international level, President Obama announced in November 2014 that the United States would seek to cut net GHG emissions 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 in return for China’s commitment to seek to peak emissions around 2030, with concurrent increases in renewable energy. In addition, the United Nations Conference on Climate Change created the Paris Agreement in December 2015. This agreement has been ratified by more than 70 countries, and entered into force in November 2016. Although this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, it does include pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. The United States signed the agreement in April 2016; however, in June 2017, President Trump stated that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, but may enter into a future international agreement related to GHGs. Pursuant to the terms of the Paris Agreement, the earliest date the United States can withdraw is November 2020.
 
At the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date. The EPA has, however, has determined that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment, because emissions of GHGs are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. For example, in August 2015, EPA finalized the CPP to cut carbon emissions from existing power plants. The CPP creates individualized emission guidelines for states to follow, and requires each state to develop an implementation plan to meet the individual state’s specific targets for reducing GHG emissions. The EPA also proposed a federal compliance plan to implement the CPP in the event that a state does not submit an approvable plan to the EPA. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the implementation of the CPP. This stay suspends the rule and will remain in effect until the completion of the appeals process. The Supreme Court’s stay only applies to EPA’s regulations for CO2 emissions from existing power plants and will not affect EPA’s standards for new power plants. In March 2017, President Trump directed the EPA to review the CPP and related rules and actions for consistency with the new administration’s policy objectives. Pursuant to this direction, the EPA proposed a rulemaking in October 2017 that would withdraw the CPP. On December 18, 2017, EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM”) to announce it is considering new emission guidelines to replace the CPP and is soliciting information on how best to implement such regulations. On August 31, 2018, EPA proposed a rule that would replace the CPP with a new rule titled the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) Rule. Although the ACE rule moves away from the individualized emission guidelines of the CPP, it would still require states to set appropriate GHG emission standards for power plants within their jurisdiction based upon the application of “candidate” heat rate improvement measures. If the CPP is ultimately upheld, and depending on how it is implemented by the states, it could have an adverse impact on the demand for coal for electric generation. Similarly, if EPA chooses to promulgate new emissions limitations to replace the CPP, such as the ACE rule, these could also have an adverse impact on the demand for coal for electric generation.
 
At the state level, several states have already adopted measures requiring GHG emissions to be reduced within state boundaries, including cap-and-trade programs and the imposition of renewable energy portfolio standards. Various states and regions have also adopted GHG initiatives and certain governmental bodies, have imposed, or are considering the imposition of, fees or taxes based on the emission of GHGs by certain facilities. A number of states have also enacted legislative mandates requiring electricity suppliers to use renewable energy sources to generate a certain percentage of power.
 
The uncertainty over the outcome of litigation challenging the CPP and the extent of future regulation of GHG emissions may inhibit utilities from investing in the building of new coal-fired plants to replace older plants or investing in the upgrading of existing coal-fired plants. Any reduction in the amount of coal consumed by electric power generators as a result of actual or potential regulation of GHG emissions could decrease demand for our coal, thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations. We or prospective customers may also have to invest in CO2 capture and storage technologies in order to burn coal and comply with future GHG emission standards.
 
Finally, there have been attempts to encourage greater regulation of coalbed methane because methane has a greater GHG effect than CO2. Methane from coal mines can give rise to safety concerns, and may require that various measures be taken to mitigate those risks. If new laws or regulations were introduced to reduce coalbed methane emissions, those rules could adversely affect our costs of operations by requiring installation of air pollution controls, higher taxes, or costs incurred to purchase credits that permit us to continue operations.
 
Clean Water Act
 
The CWA and corresponding state laws and regulations affect coal mining operations by restricting the discharge of pollutants, including dredged or fill materials, into waters of the United States. Likewise, permits are required under the CWA to construct impoundments, fills or other structure in areas that are designated as waters of the United States. The CWA provisions and associated state and federal regulations are complex and subject to amendments, legal challenges and changes in implementation. Recent court decisions, regulatory actions and proposed legislation have created uncertainty over CWA jurisdiction and permitting requirements.
 
Prior to discharging any pollutants into waters of the United States, coal mining companies must obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permit from the appropriate state or federal permitting authority. NPDES permits include effluent limitations for discharged pollutants and other terms and conditions, including required monitoring of discharges. Failure to comply with the CWA or NPDES permits can lead to the imposition of significant penalties, litigation, compliance costs and delays in coal production. Changes and proposed changes in state and federally recommended water quality standards may result in the issuance or modification of permits with new or more stringent effluent limits or terms and conditions.
 
 16


For instance, waters that states have designated as impaired (i.e., as not meeting present water quality standards) are subject to Total Maximum Daily Load regulations, which may lead to the adoption of more stringent discharge standards for our coal mines and could require more costly treatment. Likewise, the water quality of certain receiving streams requires an anti-degradation review before approving any discharge permits. TMDL regulations and anti-degradation policies may increase the cost, time and difficulty associated with obtaining and complying with NPDES permits.
 
In addition, in certain circumstances private citizens may challenge alleged violations of NPDES permit limits in court. Recently, certain citizen groups have filed lawsuits alleging ongoing discharges of pollutants, including selenium and conductance, from valley fills located at certain mining sites in some of the regions where we operate. In West Virginia, several of these cases have been successful for the challengers. While it is difficult to predict the outcome of any potential or future suits, such litigation could result in increased compliance costs following the completion of mining at our operations.
 
Finally, in June 2015, the EPA and the Corps published a new definition of “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”) that became effective on August 28, 2015. We anticipate that the WOTUS rules, if upheld in litigation and by the EPA, will expand areas requiring NPDES or Corps Section 404 permits. Many groups have filed suit to challenge the validity of this rule. In October 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit had stayed the rule nationwide pending the outcome of this litigation. In January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that only U.S. district courts have jurisdiction to hear challenges to that rule. As a result of that ruling, the Sixth Circuit dissolved its nationwide stay of the WOTUS rules on February 28, 2018. However, on February 6, 2018, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a final rule extending the applicability date of the 2015 Clean Water Rule to February 6, 2020. This change prevented the WOTUS rules from immediately coming back into effect after the stay was lifted. However, the February 2018 delay rule is subject to pending judicial challenges in multiple federal district courts. Furthermore, in February 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order directing the EPA to review and revise or rescind the WOTUS rule. On June 27, 2017, EPA proposed a rulemaking that would implement this directive by rescinding the 2015 rulemaking and re-codifying the definition in place prior to 2015. In December 2018, EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would narrow the scope of their jurisdiction. To the extent that the outcome of the pending litigation or any future rules expand the scope of the Clean Water Act's jurisdiction, the CWA permits our lessees need may not be issued, may not be issued in a timely fashion, or may be issued with new requirements which restrict our lessees’ ability to conduct their mining operations or to do so profitably. 
 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
 
RCRA and corresponding state laws establish standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes generated at our various facilities. Besides affecting current waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal practices. In addition, RCRA requires certain of our facilities to evaluate and respond to any past release, or threatened release, of a hazardous substance that may pose a risk to human health or the environment.
 
RCRA may affect coal mining operations by establishing requirements for the proper management, handling, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Currently, certain coal mine wastes, such as earth and rock covering a mineral deposit (commonly referred to as overburden) and coal cleaning wastes, are exempted from hazardous waste management under RCRA. Any change or reclassification of this exemption could significantly increase our coal mining costs.
 
EPA began regulating coal ash as a solid waste under Subtitle D of RCRA in 2015. The EPA’s rule requires closure of sites that fail to meet prescribed engineering standards, regular inspections of impoundments, and immediate remediation and closure of unlined ponds that are polluting ground water. The rule also establishes limits for the location of new sites. As initially promulgated, the rule provided an exemption for closed coal ash impoundments located at inactive facilities and also allowed for the continued operation of unlined or clay-lined ponds that were not polluting groundwater. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated these provisions of the rule in August 2018. In December 2016, Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, which provides for the establishment of state and EPA permit programs for the control of coal combustion residuals and authorizes states to incorporate EPA’s final rule for coal combustion residuals or develop other criteria that are at least as protective as the final rule. These requirements, as well as any future changes in the management of coal combustion residues, could increase our customers’ operating costs and potentially reduce their ability or need to purchase coal. In addition, contamination caused by the past disposal of coal combustion residues, including coal ash, could lead to material liability for our customers under RCRA or other federal or state laws and potentially further reduce the demand for coal.
 
 17


Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
 
CERCLA and similar state laws affect coal mining operations by, among other things, imposing cleanup requirements for threatened or actual releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under CERCLA and similar state laws, joint and several liability may be imposed on hazardous substance generators, site owners, transporters, lessees and others regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity. Although the EPA excludes most wastes generated by coal mining and processing operations from the primary hazardous waste laws, such wastes can, in certain circumstances, constitute hazardous substances for the purposes of CERCLA. In addition, the disposal, release or spilling of some products used by coal companies in operations, such as chemicals, could trigger the liability provisions of CERCLA or similar state laws. Thus, we may be subject to liability under CERCLA and similar state laws for coal mines that we currently own, lease or operate or that we or our predecessors have previously owned, leased or operated, and sites to which we or our predecessors sent hazardous substances. These liabilities could be significant and materially and adversely impact our financial results and liquidity.
Endangered Species and Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Acts
 
The ESA and similar state legislation protect species designated as threatened, endangered or other special status. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the “USFWS”) works closely with the OSMRE and state regulatory agencies to ensure that species subject to the ESA are protected from mining-related impacts. Several species indigenous to the areas in which we operate area protected under the ESA. Other species in the vicinity of our operations may have their listing status reviewed in the future and could also become protected under the ESA. In addition, the USFWS has identified bald eagle habitat in some of the counties were we operate. The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act prohibits taking certain actions that would harm bald or golden eagles without obtaining a permit from the USFWS. Compliance with the requirements of the ESA and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act could have the effect of prohibiting or delaying us from obtaining mining permits. These requirements may also include restrictions on timber harvesting, road building and other mining or agricultural activities in areas containing the affected species or their habitats.
Use of Explosives
 
Our surface mining operations are subject to numerous regulations relating to blasting activities. Due to these regulations, we will incur costs to design and implement blast schedules and to conduct pre-blast surveys and blast monitoring. In addition, the storage of explosives is subject to various regulatory requirements. For example, pursuant to a rule issued by the Department of Homeland Security in 2007, facilities in possession of chemicals of interest (including ammonium nitrate at certain threshold levels) are required to complete a screening review. Our mines are low risk, Tier 4 facilities which are not subject to additional security plans. In 2008, the Department of Homeland Security proposed regulation of ammonium nitrate under the ammonium nitrate security rule. Additional requirements may include tracking and verifications for each transaction related to ammonium nitrate, though a final rule has yet to be issued. Finally, in December 2014, the OSMRE announced its decision to pursue a rulemaking to revise regulations under SMCRA which will address all blast generated fumes and toxic gases. OSMRE has not yet issued a proposed rule to address these blasts. The outcome of these rulemakings could materially adversely impact our cost or ability to conduct our mining operations.
National Environmental Policy Act
 
NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment, such as issuing a permit or other approval. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will typically prepare an environmental assessment to determine the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project. Where the activities in question have significant impacts to the environment, the agency must prepare an environmental impact statement. Compliance with NEPA can be time-consuming and may result in the imposition of mitigation measures that could affect the amount of coal that we are able to produce from mines on federal lands, and may require public comment. Furthermore, whether agencies have complied with NEPA is subject to protest, appeal or litigation, which can delay or halt projects. The NEPA review process, including potential disputes regarding the level of evaluation required for climate change impacts, may extend the time and/or increase the costs and difficulty of obtaining necessary governmental approvals, and may lead to litigation regarding the adequacy of the NEPA analysis, which could delay or potentially preclude the issuance of approvals or grant of leases.
 
In 2016, the Council on Environmental Quality released guidance discussing how federal agencies should consider the effects of GHG emissions and climate change in their NEPA evaluations. The guidance encourages agencies to provide more detailed discussion of the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of a proposed action’s reasonably foreseeable emissions and effects. This guidance could create additional delays and costs in the NEPA review process or in our operations, or even an inability to obtain necessary federal approvals for our operations due to the increased risk of legal challenges from environmental groups seeking additional analysis of climate impacts.
 
Other Environmental Laws
 
We are required to comply with numerous other federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations in addition to those previously discussed. These additional laws include but are not limited to the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. Each of these laws can impact permitting or planned operations and can result in additional costs or operational delays.

Seasonality
 
Our primary business is not materially impacted by seasonal fluctuations. Demand for metallurgical coal is generally more heavily influenced by other factors such as the general economy, interest rates and commodity prices.
Employees
 
We had 349 employees as of December 31, 2018, including our named executive officers. We also depend on experienced contractors and third-party industry consultants to conduct some of our day-to-day activities. We plan to continue to use the services of many of these contractors and consultants. 
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”)
 
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”). For as long as we are an emerging growth company, unlike public companies that are not emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act, we will not be required to:
