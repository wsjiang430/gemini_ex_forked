Item 1. Business
Overview

We are engaged in the development and sale of advanced technology solutions and products to personalize the development and use of oncology drugs.  Utilizing our TumorGraft Technology Platform, we provide select services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies seeking personalized approaches to drug development. By performing studies to predict the efficacy of oncology drugs, our Platform facilitates drug discovery with lower costs and increased speed of drug development as well as increased adoption of existing drugs. The current oncology drug development paradigm is challenging for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. We believe that on average, the clinical trial process in oncology currently:

• | costs more than $1.2 billion;


• | takes approximately 8 years to complete;


• | has a 93% failure rate; and


• | results in approved compounds that cost more than $11,000 per month.

Our platform provides a novel approach to simulating the results of human clinical trials used in developing oncology drugs. According to a 2013 study conducted by Cutting Edge Information, it can cost up to $100,000 per patient in oncology clinical trials and the typical cost for each phase of development per year increases from approximately $3 million in the pre-clinical setting to approximately $150 million in phase III. Simulating trials before executing them provides benefits to both pharmaceutical companies and patients. Pharmaceutical companies can lower the risk of spending resources on drugs that do not show significant anti-cancer activities and increase the chance that the clinical development path they pursue will be focused on an appropriate patient population and a successful combination with other drugs.

TumorGraft Technology Platform

Our clinical trial simulation platform consists of processes, physical tumors, and information that we use to personalize the development and use of oncology drugs.  Each tumor from individual patients that we have preserved for future implantation in mice, along with the patient data and molecular information associated with these tumors, are referred to as “TumorGrafts” or “Patient Derived XenoGrafts” or “PDX Models”. Our process technology involves the following:

• | implantation of human tumor fragments in immune-deficient mice;


• | expansion of the original human tumor into a larger colony of mice through the passage of the tumor to a limited number of generations of mice;


• | treatment of the implanted mice with oncology drugs;


• | measurement of tumor growth inhibition in treated mice relative to a control group of mice to determine the response of the tumor to the drug; and


• | permanent cryo-preservation of fragments of tumor tissue for future use in additional clinical trial simulations.

A growing body of evidence demonstrates the power of PDX to predict the response of individual patients to oncology drugs. Our platform has demonstrated a positive predictive value of approximately 87% and negative predictive value of approximately 94%. As a result, we believe our PDX platform results in simulated clinical studies with approximately 90% accuracy in predicting human response with approximately 90% lower costs than a human clinical trial while shortening the timelines from 2-3 years for human trial to 6 months for PDX studies.
TumorBank
The collection of TumorGrafts that we have built is referred to as our "TumorBank". We currently have approximately 1,500 PDX Models in our TumorBank that we believe reflect characteristics of patients who enroll in clinical trials (late stage, pretreated and metastic). We implant tumors in mice to provide pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies the opportunity to test oncology compounds on multiple tumors to test efficacy and simulate the results of human clinical trials. 
Increasing breadth and depth of the TumorBank is an important strategic effort of the company. We invest significant research and development resources to increase the number of PDX Models in our TumorBank and add unique and different sub-types of cancer that we have not historically addressed. In addition, we have developed a proprietary data tool containing comprehensive information derived from our clinical studies. This database includes certain information about the patient (e.g. age, gender), the response of the tumors to different oncology drugs or drug combinations, mutational status of key oncogenes, and other genetic and epigenetic data about each tumor. This data may be used by pharmaceutical companies seeking to develop new cancer drugs.
Based on our extensive knowledge of the industry, we believe that we are a leading provider of Patient Derived XenoGrafts and a pioneer in the use of PDX Models for use with efficacy studies, patients and clinical trial simulations. Our research and development efforts and customer sponsored platform development has contributed to the acceptance of the accuracy of PDX Models as a valuable tool in the development and use of oncology drugs.
Our Strategy

Our strategy is to use TumorGrafts as a platform technology to drive multiple synergistic revenue streams. We continue to build this platform with investments in research and development. Our goal is to populate our TumorBank and its related database with tumors and information we receive from patients, research collaborations and validation studies. The tumors and information in the TumorBank are then available for work with pharmaceutical company customers. In addition, we are looking for additional opportunities to monetize the data we are gathering about the tumors to develop proprietary biomarkers and signatures of response that can predict the resistance or sensitivity of individual patients to oncology drugs.

Translational Oncology Solutions Business

Our Translational Oncology Solutions ("TOS") business utilizes our technology platform to assist pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with their drug development process.  We provide studies, or license tumors for use in studies, which we believe may predict the efficacy of experimental oncology drugs or approved drugs as stand-alone therapies or in combination with other drugs and can stimulate the results of human clinical trials.  These studies include in vivo studies that rely on implanting multiple tumors from our TumorBank in mice and testing the therapy of interest on these tumors.  Studies may also include bioinformatics analysis that reveal the differences in the genetic signatures of the tumors that responded to a therapy as compared to the tumors that did not respond.  Our studies can be used to determine which types of cancer, if any, may be inhibited by a drug.  The studies can also be used to identify specific sub-populations, often characterized by particular genetic mutations that are differentially sensitive or resistant to a drug or drug combination.  These studies, used in pre-clinical testing or during phase I or II of a clinical trial, can help guide the clinical development path of new compounds or find new indications or combinations for compounds that are already approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. We believe that the results may lead to lower costs and shorter timeframes for drug development.

We have performed studies for approximately 300 different pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies over the past eight years. We have a high rate of repeat business. Typical studies are in the $100,000 price range, with an increasing number of studies in the $250,000 to $500,000 range. Revenue from this business has grown at a cumulative annual growth rate of 32% since 2015.
Our sales and marketing efforts are dependent on a dedicated sales force that sells our services directly to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We have a team of 14 professionals dedicated to this sales and marketing effort. The team is focused on identifying and selling studies to new customers as well as increasing our revenue from existing customers. We spend significant resources in informing our current customers and reaching out to new contacts within companies that we currently serve. These efforts are aimed at moving our customers along the adoption curve for PDX-based clinical trial simulation and increasing the number of studies and the average study size of our existing customers. Our success in these efforts is demonstrated by the growing number of customers who have increased their annual spend on our services over the past three years.

For the year ended April 30, 2019, revenues from our TOS products totaled approximately $25.8 million, an increase of approximately 37.3% from the previous year.
Personalized Oncology Solutions Business

Our Personalized Oncology Solutions ("POS") business, which supports our TOS business, offers physicians and patients information to help guide the development of personalized treatment plans.  Our core products, TumorGraft implants and drug panels, utilize TumorGraft technology to empirically test the response of a patient’s tumor to multiple oncology drugs or drug combinations.  The response of the tumors in the mice is tracked over time and analyzed to determine which drug or drug combination is providing the highest level of tumor growth inhibition in the mice.  This process simulates the results of multiple, simultaneous clinical trials in which a patient might consider participating. By providing this product, we achieve an important goal of adding PDX Models to our TumorBank, and gain valuable data about the accuracy of PDX Models in predicting patient response and in building the operational capabilities to collect, implant and grow tumors from patients, physicians and hospitals around the United States and internationally. Our data, which is currently limited in nature, indicates that there may be a correlation between the response to drugs of a tumor in a mouse with the response to drugs of a tumor in a patient.

In addition to our core TumorGraft POS products, we offer non-core related POS products to our customers, including personalized tumor boards and gene sequencing.  Personalized tumor boards are designed to provide access to oncologists with expertise in particular tumor types.   We also provide access to gene sequencing that analyzes the genetic makeup of a patient’s tumor for the purpose of identifying potentially useful drugs. 
As previously disclosed, our POS business is not the focus of our growth moving forward. We continue to offer the POS products in support of our TOS business.
For the year ended April 30, 2019, revenues from our POS business totaled approximately $1.3 million, a decrease of approximately 12.2% from the previous year.

Our Growth and Expansion Strategy
Our strategy is to continue to use TumorGrafts as a platform technology to drive multiple synergistic revenue streams. 
Our current strategy for growth has three components: 

• | Growing our TumorBank: We grow our TumorBank in two ways. First, we increase the number of TumorGrafts in the bank for our existing tumor types to ensure customers are finding the specific models they need for their studies. Second, we add new tumor types to the bank to enable studies in tumor types that we have not historically been able to run for our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers. 


• | Adding new PDX technologies: The fields of oncology research and drug development are evolving. To keep up with new approaches, we add new technologies to our PDX platform. We are currently investing in developing ImmunoGrafts, a new PDX model that is developed in a mouse with a humanized immune system. These models are built to specifically serve the needs of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies developing immune oncology drugs. This is a relatively new area of oncology research that has shown significant promise and is attracting a significant amount of research and development interest. 


• | Increasing the scale of studies: We have facilitated studies for over 300 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We believe there is significant opportunity to grow our revenue by increasing the size of the studies these customers run. To accomplish this, we are developing new study designs that offer solutions to compounds that are in phase I and phase II clinical trials. We believe that the increased budgets of these drugs, as compared to drugs in the pre-clinical stage, will enable us to sell larger studies. 

Competition

Our TumorGraft Technology Platform is proprietary and requires significant know-how to both initiate and operate, but is not patented.  It is, therefore, possible for competitors to develop other implantation procedures or to discover the same procedures utilized by the Company that could compete with the Company in its market.  Competition in our industry is intense and based significantly on scientific, technological, and market forces, which include the effectiveness of the technology and products and the ability to commercialize technological developments.  The Company faces significant competition from other healthcare companies in the United States and abroad.  The majority of these competitors are, and will be, substantially larger than the Company, and have substantially greater resources and operating histories.  There can be no assurance that developments by other companies will not render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive or that we will be able to keep pace with the technological or product developments of our competitors.  These companies, as well as academic institutions, governmental agencies, and private research organizations also compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific, technical and professional personnel and consultants.
Research and Development

For the years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, we spent approximately $4.8 million and $4.4 million, respectively, to develop our TumorGraft Technology Platform. We continue to expand our TumorBank through the inclusion of tumor tissue and implanted models through research collaborations and relationships with hospitals and academic institutions. Our research and development efforts were focused on increasing our understanding of our TumorGraft models, their clinical predictability, improving growth and tumor take rates, and other biological and molecular characteristics of the models. Additionally, during fiscal year 2019 we invested resources for the development of new product offerings. 
Government Regulation

The research, development, and marketing of our products, the performance of our POS testing services, and the operation of our facilities are generally subject to federal, state, local, or foreign legislation, including licensure of our laboratory located in Rockville, Maryland by the State of Maryland and compliance with federal, state, local or foreign legislation applicable to the use of live animals in scientific testing, research and education.

The FDA has claimed regulatory authority over laboratory developed tests such as our POS products, but has generally not exercised it. The FDA has announced regulatory and guidance initiatives that could increase federal regulation of our business. We are subject to federal and international regulations with regard to shipment of hazardous materials, including the Department of Transportation and the International Air Transit Authority. These regulations require interstate, intrastate, and foreign shipments comply with applicable labeling, documentation, and training requirements.
