Item 1. Description of Business.
 
We are based in San Diego, California, and were incorporated in Wyoming on September 26, 2013. On June 30, 2011, International Land Alliance, SA De CV (“ILA Mexico”) was formed as a Mexican corporation to acquire from Baja Residents Club, S.A., a Mexican corporation, 497 acres south of San Felipe, Baja, California, known as the Oasis Park project and 20 acres in Ensenada, Baja, California, known as the Valle Divino project. The acquisition of title to the land for both projects is subject to approval from the Mexican government in Baja, California. Although management believes that the transfer of title to the land from Baja Residents Club will be approved within the next 60 days, there is no assurance that such transfer of title will be approved in that time frame or at all. On October 1, 2013 Roberto Jesus Valdez, Jason A. Sunstein and Elizabeth Roemer transferred their interest in Oasis Park and Valle Divino real estate projects to ILA Mexico in exchange for 7,500 shares of ILA Mexico. On October 1, 2013, we issued 3,750,000 shares of our common stock to Roberto Jesus Valdez, 3,750,000 shares of our common stock to Jason Sunstein and 1,000,000 shares of our common stock to Elizabeth Roemer in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of ILA Mexico.
 
On October 1, 2013 Jason Sunstein transferred his 3,750,000 shares to Jason A. Sunstein Family Investments LLC. Jason Sunstein Family Investments, LLC subsequently transferred 250,000 shares of common stock to two unrelated persons.
 
As a result of this transaction, ILA Mexico became our wholly owned subsidiary.
 
Overview
 
We are a residential land development company with target properties located primarily in the Baja California Norte region of Mexico. Our principal activities are purchasing properties, obtaining zoning and other entitlements required to subdivide the properties into residential and commercial building lots, securing financing for the purchase of the lots, improving the properties’ infrastructure and amenities, and selling the lots to homebuyers, retirees, investors and commercial developers. We offer the option of financing (ie. taking a promissory note from the buyer for all or part of the purchase price) with a guaranteed acceptance on any purchase for every customer.
Industry Overview
 
Mexico’s real estate industry has been experiencing a new wave of growth brought about by the creation of investment trusts, significant changes in regulations, competitive land prices and the economic development of new business centers across the country.

In a recent annual survey conducted by The Association of Foreign Investors in Real Estate- (AFIRE) Mexico was listed as the third highest emerging country for commercial real estate investments, following China and Brazil. Without a doubt, this real estate boom is reflected in the growing number of residential, commercial and industrial construction projects being carried out in cities throughout Mexico.
 
Market Opportunity
 
For years, U.S. & Canadian retirees have flocked to Mexico as an alternative overseas retirement destination that was affordable, offered desirable weather and was close to their communities of origin in North America. These attributes have made Mexico the top overseas retirement destination for older Americans, resulting in a building boom that reached its peak in 2005/06 and stretched from Playas de Tijuana-Rosarito and Los Cabos along the Baja California peninsula and from Puerto Peñasco, Sonora to Mazatlán, Sinaloa. In southern Mexico, the real estate focus has been on expanding the Cancún corridor to the Riviera Maya.
 
Mexico remains a viable retirement option for Americans aged 50 years and over, offering a reduced cost of living, lower health care expenses, and proximity to friends and family in the United States. In addition, over half of survey respondents observed that their motivation to purchase a home in Mexico was based on their desire to have a home on or near the coast that would otherwise be unattainable in the United States.
 
In addition to U.S. and Canadian citizens, Baja California has seen a noticeable increase in business from Japan and Europe. With the interest in Baja expected to continue along with Mexico’s overall economic growth, we will be well positioned to offer prospective homebuyers and investors a luxurious residence with breathtaking views for an affordable price.
 
Target Market
 
The Oasis Park and Ville Divino projects will be marketed toward residents of the United States and Canada. Specifically, we will target the influx of Maquiladoras (manufacturing facilities) moving to Mexico as well as the residents of California, Texas, Arizona and Washington for the purpose of appealing to their need for a second home or retirement property. The targeted market includes residents making over $50,000 or a combined household income of $150,000.
 
Our target home buyers are typically professionals who own an existing property. Many are married without children or married with several children. The target audience enjoys a vacation away from home and often seeks information regarding villas or condominiums as a second home or vacation destination. We plan to provide them with an affordable location for a vacation home in a community that surpasses all of their expectations.
 
Growth Strategy
 
We believe that growth of homebuilders in Mexico has created opportunities for smaller companies with long-term experience and relationships in their local markets. We believe that we can utilize our many strengths to benefit our target market. These strengths include:

● | better knowledge of local demand; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | superior understanding of the entitlement and acquisition process; 
● | affordable high quality homes and aggressive marketing; 
● | long term relationships with local regulatory authorities, land owners, designers and contractors; and 
● | faster and less cumbersome financing processes. 

 
It is our plan to utilize these advantages to move more quickly and address the needs of those in our target market, especially retirees looking to purchase a home in Mexico.
 
Competition
 
The Mexican public real estate market is fragmented and highly competitive. We compete with numerous developers, builders and others for the acquisition of property and with local, regional and national developers, homebuilders and others with respect to the sale of residential properties. We also compete with builders and developers to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms.
 
The Company is also subject to competition from other entities engaged in the business of resort development, sales and operation, including vacation interval ownership, condominiums, hotels and motels. Some of the world’s most recognized lodging, hospitality and entertainment companies have begun to develop and sell resort properties in the Baja California area. Many of these entities possess significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than those of the Company. Management believes that recent regulatory developments in the electricity industry and overall growth in the Mexican economy will increase competition in the real estate investment industry.

Research & Development
 
The company is in the process of acquiring properties, as well as developing their marketing and sales strategy. The company is also developing an interactive website and help center to answer questions from potential home buyers.
Intellectual Property
 
We currently have no patents, copyrights, trademarks and/or service marks, nor do we have any plans to file applications for such rights.
 
Government Regulation
 
The housing and land development industries are subject to increasing environmental, building, zoning and real estate sales regulations by various authorities. Such regulations affect home building by specifying, among other things, the type and quality of building materials that must be used, certain aspects of land use and building design. Some regulations affect development activities by directly affecting the viability and timing of projects.
 
We must obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities that regulate such matters as land use and level of density, the installation of utility services, such as water and waste disposal, and the dedication of acreage for open space, parks, schools and other community purposes. If these authorities determine that existing utility services will not adequately support proposed development, building moratoria may be imposed. As a result, we use substantial resources to evaluate the impact of government restrictions imposed upon new residential development. Furthermore, as local circumstances or applicable laws change, we may be required to obtain additional approvals or modifications of approvals previously obtained or we may be forced to stop work. These increasing regulations may result in a significant increase in resources between our initial acquisition of land and the commencement and the completion of developments. In addition, the extent to which we participate in land development activities subjects us to greater exposure to regulatory risks.
 
Additionally, the Mexican real estate industry is subject to substantially different regulation than the U.S. real estate industry. The Mexican constitution of 1917 prohibited foreign ownership of residential real property within approximately 31 miles (approximately 50 km) of any coastline and 62 miles (approximately 100 km) of its natural borders. All of Baja California is included in this “restricted zone.” In 1971 (further expanded in 1989 and 1993) provisions were made for a mechanism that would allow foreigners to own property in the “restricted zone.” Within the “restricted zone,” a foreigner can purchase the beneficial interest in real property through a bank trust or “fideicomiso.” Thus, virtually all property in Mexico is available for purchase by foreigners, keeping in mind that the fideicomiso, or bank trust, must be used when acquiring property within the restricted zone.
 
In this bank trust, the buyer of the property is designated as the “fideicomisario” or the beneficiary of the trust. While legal title is held by the bank, (specifically the trustee of the trust or the “fiduciario,”) the trustee must administer the property in accordance with the instructions of the buyer (the beneficiary of the trust). The property is not an asset of the bank and the trustee is obligated to follow every lawful instruction given by the beneficiary to perform legal actions, i.e. rent it, make improvements, sell it, etc.
 
As long as the foreign buyer of the property adheres to laws and ordinances of Mexico and agrees not to invoke the protection of the government of his country, he may exercise the same rights as a Mexican national with regard to the use of his property.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this prospectus, we had three employees, all of whom were our executive officers. We may in the future rely on independent contractors to assist us in marketing and selling our products.
 
None of our employees are currently bound by agreements for any specific employment term or covenants not to compete. However, we may enter into employment agreements with these persons which will have appropriate non-competition provisions.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
We know of no existing or pending legal proceedings against us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or any of their respective affiliates, or any beneficial stockholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.
Properties
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 350 10th Ave., Suite 1000, San Diego, CA 92101. We are on a month to month lease with a monthly rental of $269.
