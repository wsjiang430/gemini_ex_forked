DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Vado Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 10, 2017 and established a fiscal year end of November 30. We have limited revenues, have minimal assets and have incurred losses since inception. We were formed to engage in the embroidery business. We are still in the development stage and just recently started our operations. As of today, we have commenced manufacturing the embroidery and generated $15,284 in revenues.
 We offer embroidery products that include the embroidery not only on cut, but also on finished products such as work wear, pennants, t-shirts, jerseys, sweatshirts, baseball caps, windbreakers, coveralls, uniforms, towels, hats, jackets, linen, blankets, and others.  We purchased an 8-head embroidery machine that operates through the computer, and which allows us to embroider simultaneously eight items.
