ITEM 1. BUSINESS OF CNO.
CNO Financial Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("CNO"), is a holding company for a group of insurance companies operating throughout the United States that develop, market and administer health insurance, annuity, individual life insurance and other insurance products. The terms "CNO Financial Group, Inc.", "CNO", the "Company", "we", "us", and "our" as used in this report refer to CNO and its subsidiaries. Such terms, when used to describe insurance business and products, refer to the insurance business and products of CNO's insurance subsidiaries.
We focus on serving middle-income pre-retiree and retired Americans, which we believe are attractive, underserved, high growth markets. We sell our products through three distribution channels: career agents, independent producers (some of whom sell one or more of our product lines exclusively) and direct marketing. As of December 31, 2018, we had shareholders' equity of $3.4 billion and assets of $31.4 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had revenues of $4.3 billion and a net loss of $315.0 million (including a loss on a reinsurance transaction of $661.1 million, net of taxes and gains recognized on the assets transferred in the transaction). See our consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes for additional financial information about the Company and its segments.
The Company manages its business through the following operating segments: Bankers Life, Washington National and Colonial Penn, which are defined on the basis of product distribution; long-term care in run-off; and corporate operations, comprised of holding company activities and certain noninsurance company businesses. On September 27, 2018, the Company completed a long-term care reinsurance transaction pursuant to which its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bankers Life and Casualty Company ("Bankers Life"), entered into an agreement with Wilton Reassurance Company ("Wilton Re") to cede all of its legacy (prior to 2003) comprehensive and nursing home long-term care policies (with statutory reserves of $2.7 billion) through 100% indemnity coinsurance. In anticipation of the reinsurance agreement, the Company reorganized its business segments to move the block to be ceded from the "Bankers Life segment" to the "Long-term care in run-off segment" in the third quarter of 2018. All prior period segment disclosures have been revised to conform to management's current view of the Company's operating segments.
The Company’s insurance segments are described below:

• | Bankers Life, which underwrites, markets and distributes Medicare supplement insurance, interest-sensitive life insurance, traditional life insurance, fixed annuities and long-term care insurance products to the middle-income senior market through a dedicated field force of career agents, financial and investment advisors, and sales managers supported by a network of community-based sales offices. The Bankers Life segment includes primarily the business of Bankers Life. Bankers Life also has various distribution and marketing agreements with other insurance companies to use Bankers Life's career agents to distribute Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans ("PDP") products in exchange for a fee. 


• | Washington National, which underwrites, markets and distributes supplemental health (including specified disease, accident and hospital indemnity insurance products) and life insurance to middle-income consumers at home and at the worksite. These products are marketed through Performance Matters Associates, Inc. ("PMA", a wholly owned subsidiary) and through independent marketing organizations and insurance agencies including worksite marketing. The products being marketed are underwritten by Washington National Insurance Company ("Washington National"). This segment's business also includes certain closed blocks of annuities and Medicare supplement policies which are no longer being actively marketed by this segment and were primarily issued or acquired by Washington National. 


• | Colonial Penn, which markets primarily graded benefit and simplified issue life insurance directly to customers in the senior middle-income market through television advertising, direct mail, the internet and telemarketing. The Colonial Penn segment includes primarily the business of Colonial Penn Life Insurance Company ("Colonial Penn"). 


• | Long-term care in run-off consists of: (i) the long-term care business that was recaptured due to the termination of certain reinsurance agreements effective September 30, 2016 (such business is not actively marketed and was issued or acquired by Washington National and Bankers Conseco Life Insurance Company ("BCLIC")); and (ii) certain legacy (prior to 2003) comprehensive and nursing home long-term care policies which were ceded to Wilton Re in September 2018 (such business was not actively marketed and was issued by Bankers Life).

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
Insurance
Our insurance subsidiaries develop, market and administer health insurance, annuity, individual life insurance and other insurance products. We sell these products through three primary distribution channels: career agents, independent producers (some of whom sell one or more of our product lines exclusively) and direct marketing. We had premium collections of $3.8 billion, $3.7 billion and $3.6 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Our insurance subsidiaries collectively hold licenses to market our insurance products in all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and certain protectorates of the United States. Sales to residents of the following states accounted for at least five percent of our 2018 collected premiums: Florida (10 percent), Pennsylvania (6 percent), Texas (5 percent) and Iowa (5 percent).
We believe that most purchases of life insurance, accident and health insurance and annuity products occur only after individuals are contacted and solicited by an insurance agent. Accordingly, the success of our distribution system is largely dependent on our ability to attract and retain experienced and highly motivated agents. A description of our primary distribution channels is as follows:
Career Agents. The products of the Bankers Life segment are sold through a career agency force of over 4,100 producing agents working from over 265 Bankers Life branch offices and satellites. These agents establish one-on-one contact with potential policyholders and promote strong personal relationships with existing policyholders. The career agents sell primarily Medicare supplement and long-term care insurance policies, life insurance and annuities. In 2018, the Bankers Life segment had total collected premiums related to this distribution channel of $2.6 billion, or 70 percent, of our total collected premiums. These agents sell Bankers Life policies, as well as Medicare Advantage plans through distribution arrangements with third-party insurance companies, and typically visit the prospective policyholder's home to conduct personalized "kitchen-table" sales presentations. After the sale of an insurance policy, the agent serves as a contact person for policyholder questions, claims assistance and additional insurance needs.
Independent Producers. The products of the Washington National segment are primarily sold through our wholly-owned marketing organization, PMA. In addition, Washington National's products are sold through a diverse network of independent agents, insurance brokers and marketing organizations. The general agency and insurance brokerage distribution system is comprised of independent licensed agents doing business in all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and certain protectorates of the United States. In 2018, this distribution channel accounted for $692.8 million, or 18 percent, of our total collected premiums.
Marketing organizations typically recruit agents by advertising our products and commission structure through direct mail advertising or through seminars for agents and brokers. These organizations bear most of the costs incurred in marketing our products. We compensate the marketing organizations by paying them a percentage of the commissions earned on new sales generated by agents recruited by such organizations. Certain of these marketing organizations are specialty organizations that have a marketing expertise or a distribution system related to a particular product or market, such as worksite and individual health products.
Direct Marketing. This distribution channel is engaged primarily in the sale of graded benefit life insurance policies through Colonial Penn using direct response marketing techniques. New policyholder leads are generated primarily from

television, print advertising, direct response mailings and the internet. In 2018, this channel accounted for $298.3 million, or 8 percent, of our total collected premiums.

The following describes our major health products:
Medicare Supplement. Medicare supplement collected premiums were $782.1 million during 2018, or 21 percent, of our total collected premiums. Medicare is a federal health insurance program for disabled persons and seniors (age 65 and older). Part A of the program provides protection against the costs of hospitalization and related hospital and skilled nursing facility care, subject to an initial deductible, related coinsurance amounts and specified maximum benefit levels. The deductible and coinsurance amounts are subject to change each year by the federal government. Part B of Medicare covers doctor's bills and a number of other medical costs not covered by Part A, subject to deductible and coinsurance amounts for charges approved by Medicare. The deductible amount is subject to change each year by the federal government. 
Medicare supplement policies provide coverage for many of the hospital and medical expenses which the Medicare program does not cover, such as deductibles, coinsurance costs (in which the insured and Medicare share the costs of medical expenses) and specified losses which exceed the federal program's maximum benefits. Our Medicare supplement plans automatically adjust coverage to reflect changes in Medicare benefits. In marketing these products, we currently concentrate on individuals who have recently become eligible for Medicare by reaching the age of 65. Approximately 62 percent of new sales of Medicare supplement policies in 2018 were to individuals who had recently reached the age of 65.
Bankers Life sells Medicare supplement insurance. Washington National discontinued new sales of Medicare supplement policies in 2012 to focus on the sale of supplemental health products. 
Long-Term Care. Long-term care collected premiums were $400.9 million during 2018, or 10 percent of our total collected premiums. Excluding the collected premiums related to the legacy long-term care business that was ceded under a 100% indemnity coinsurance agreement in September 2018, long-term care collected premiums were $270.4 million during 2018, or 7 percent of our total collected premiums. Long-term care products provide coverage, within prescribed limits, for nursing homes, home healthcare, or a combination of both. We sell long-term care plans primarily to retirees and, to a lesser degree, to older self-employed individuals in the middle-income market. 
7


We continue to sell long-term care insurance through the Bankers Life career agent distribution channel. The business currently being sold is underwritten using stricter underwriting and pricing standards and has shorter benefit periods than the long-term care policies that were ceded pursuant to a reinsurance transaction completed in September 2018. During 2018, 98 percent of new sales of long-term care products in the Bankers Life segment had benefit periods of two years or less and 25 percent of all new sales are reinsured with a third party. At December 31, 2018, 94 percent of the long-term care policies in the Bankers Life segment have benefit periods of less than four years and 55 percent of such long-term care policies have benefit periods of one year or less. In the third quarter of 2018, we ceased sales of home health care only long-term care policies. In addition, we ceased sales of comprehensive and nursing home long-term care policies with benefit periods exceeding three years. Comprehensive policies cover both nursing home care and home healthcare. Home healthcare benefits included in comprehensive policies cover incurred charges after a deductible or elimination period and are subject to a weekly or monthly maximum dollar amount, and an overall benefit maximum. We monitor the loss experience on our long-term care products and, when appropriate, apply for actuarially justified rate increases in the jurisdictions in which we sell such products. Regulatory approval is required before we can increase our premiums on these products. 
Supplemental Health Products. Supplemental health collected premiums were $634.9 million during 2018, or 17 percent of our total collected premiums. These policies generally provide fixed or limited benefits. Cancer insurance and heart/stroke products are guaranteed renewable individual accident and health insurance policies. Payments under cancer insurance policies are generally made directly to, or at the direction of, the policyholder following diagnosis of, or treatment for, a covered type of cancer. Heart/stroke policies provide for payments directly to the policyholder for treatment of a covered heart disease, heart attack or stroke. Accident products combine insurance for accidental death with limited benefit disability income insurance. Hospital indemnity products provide a fixed dollar amount per day of confinement in a hospital. The benefits provided under the supplemental health policies do not necessarily reflect the actual cost incurred by the insured as a result of the illness, or accident, and benefits are not reduced by any other medical insurance payments made to or on behalf of the insured.
Approximately 74 percent of the total number of our supplemental health policies inforce was sold with return of premium or cash value riders. The return of premium rider generally provides that, after a policy has been inforce for a specified number of years or upon the policyholder reaching a specified age, we will pay to the policyholder, or in some cases, a beneficiary under the policy, the aggregate amount of all premiums paid under the policy, without interest, less the aggregate amount of all claims incurred under the policy. For some policies, the return of premium rider does not have any claim offset. The cash value rider is similar to the return of premium rider, but also provides for payment of a graded portion of the return of premium benefit if the policy terminates before the return of premium benefit is earned. 
Premiums collected on supplemental health products in the Bankers Life segment primarily relate to a critical illness product that was introduced in 2012. This critical illness insurance product pays a lump sum cash benefit directly to the insured when the insured is diagnosed with a specified critical illness. The product is designed to provide additional financial protection associated with treatment and recovery as well as cover non-medical expenses such as: (i) loss of income; (ii) at home recovery or treatment; (iii) experimental and/or alternative medicine; (iv) co-pays, deductibles and out-of-network expenses; and (v) child care and transportation costs. 
Other Health Products. Collected premiums on other health products were $7.9 million during 2018. This category includes various other health products such as disability income products which are sold in small amounts and other products such as major medical health insurance which are no longer actively marketed.

Annuities

Total annuity premium collections | $ | 1,164.5 | | | $ | 1,031.5 | | $ | 971.5

During 2018, we collected annuity premiums of $1,164.5 million, or 31 percent, of our total premiums collected. Annuity products include fixed index annuity, traditional fixed rate annuity and single premium immediate annuity products sold through Bankers Life. Washington National no longer actively sells annuity products. Annuities offer a tax-deferred means of accumulating savings for retirement needs, and provide a tax-efficient source of income in the payout period. Our major source of income from fixed rate annuities is the spread between the investment income earned on the underlying general account assets and the interest credited to contractholders' accounts. For fixed index annuities, our major source of income is the spread between the investment income earned on the underlying general account assets and the cost of the index options purchased to provide index-based credits to the contractholders' accounts. 
The mix of premium collections between Bankers Life's fixed index products and fixed interest annuity products has fluctuated due to volatility in the financial markets in recent periods. In addition, premium collections from Bankers Life's fixed rate annuity products have been negatively impacted by low market interest rates in recent periods. 
The following describes the major annuity products: 
Fixed Index Annuities. These products accounted for $1,113.1 million, or 30 percent, of our total premium collections during 2018. The account value (or "accumulation value") of these annuities is credited in an amount that is based on changes in a particular index during a specified period of time. Within each contract issued, each fixed index annuity specifies: 

• | The index to be used.


• | The time period during which the change in the index is measured. At the end of the time period, the change in the index is applied to the account value. The time period of the contract ranges from 1 to 4 years. 


• | The method used to measure the change in the index.


• | The measured change in the index is multiplied by a "participation rate" (percentage of change in the index) before the credit is applied. Some policies guarantee the initial participation rate for the life of the contract, and some vary the rate for each period. 


• | The measured change in the index may also be limited by a "cap" before the credit is applied. Some policies guarantee the initial cap for the life of the contract, and some vary the cap for each period. 


• | The measured change in the index may also be limited to the excess in the measured change over a "margin" before the credit is applied. Some policies guarantee the initial margin for the life of the contract, and some vary the margin for each period. 

These products have guaranteed minimum cash surrender values, regardless of actual index performance and the resulting indexed-based interest credits applied. In 2016, we began offering a guaranteed lifetime income annuity, which allows policyholders to opt to receive a guaranteed income stream for life, without having to annuitize their policy.
9


We have generally been successful at hedging increases to policyholder benefits resulting from increases in the indices to which the product's return is linked. 
In 2018, a significant portion of our new annuity sales were "bonus interest" products. These products typically specify a bonus interest rate that generally ranges from 2 percent to 5 percent for the first policy year only. After the first year, the bonus interest portion of the initial crediting rate is automatically discontinued, and the renewal crediting is established. 
Other Fixed Interest Annuities. These products include fixed rate single-premium deferred annuities ("SPDAs"), flexible premium deferred annuities ("FPDAs") and single-premium immediate annuities ("SPIAs"). These products accounted for $51.4 million, or 1 percent, of our total premium collections during 2018, of which SPDAs and FPDAs comprised $43.6 million. Our fixed rate SPDAs and FPDAs typically have a crediting rate that is guaranteed by the Company for the first policy year, after which we have the ability to change the crediting rate to any rate not below a guaranteed minimum rate. The guaranteed rates on annuities written recently are 1 percent, and the guaranteed rates on all policies inforce range from 1.0 percent to 5.5 percent. As of December 31, 2018, the average crediting rate on our outstanding traditional annuities was 3 percent.
The initial crediting rate is largely a function of: 
•the interest rate we can earn on invested assets acquired with the new annuity fund deposits; 
•the costs related to marketing and maintaining the annuity products; and 
•the rates offered on similar products by our competitors. 
For subsequent adjustments to crediting rates, we take into account current and prospective yields on investments, annuity surrender assumptions, competitive industry pricing and the crediting rate history for particular groups of annuity policies with similar characteristics.
Withdrawals from fixed interest annuities we are currently selling are generally subject to a surrender charge of 8 percent to 10 percent in the first year, declining to zero over a 5 to 12 year period, depending on issue age and product. Surrender charges are set at levels intended to protect the Company from loss on early terminations and to reduce the likelihood that policyholders will terminate their policies during periods of increasing interest rates. This practice is intended to lengthen the duration of policy liabilities and to enable us to maintain profitability on such policies. 
Penalty-free withdrawals from fixed interest annuities of up to 10 percent of either premiums or account value are available in most fixed interest annuities after the first year of the annuity's term. 
Some fixed interest annuity products apply a market value adjustment during the surrender charge period. This adjustment is determined by a formula specified in the annuity contract, and may increase or decrease the cash surrender value depending on changes in the amount and direction of market interest rates or credited interest rates at the time of withdrawal. The resulting cash surrender values will be at least equal to the guaranteed minimum values. 
SPIAs accounted for $7.8 million of our total premiums collected in 2018. SPIAs are designed to provide a series of periodic payments for a fixed period of time or for life, according to the policyholder's choice at the time of issuance. Once the payments begin, the amount, frequency and length of time over which they are payable are fixed. SPIAs often are purchased by persons at or near retirement age who desire a steady stream of payments over a future period of years. The single premium is often the payout from a fixed rate contract. The implicit interest rate on SPIAs is based on market conditions when the policy is issued. The implicit interest rate on our outstanding SPIAs averaged 6.7 percent at December 31, 2018.

Total life insurance premium collections | $ | 794.8 | | | $ | 782.0 | | $ | 768.3

Life products include traditional and interest-sensitive life insurance products. These products are currently sold through the Bankers Life, Washington National and Colonial Penn segments. During 2018, we collected life insurance premiums of $794.8 million, or 21 percent, of our total collected premiums. 
Interest-Sensitive Life Products. These products include universal life and other interest-sensitive life products that provide life insurance with adjustable rates of return related to current interest rates. They accounted for $193.1 million, or 5 percent, of our total collected premiums in 2018. These products are marketed by independent producers and career agents (including independent producers and career agents specializing in worksite sales). The principal differences between universal life products and other interest-sensitive life products are policy provisions affecting the amount and timing of premium payments. Universal life policyholders may vary the frequency and size of their premium payments, and policy benefits may also fluctuate according to such payments. Premium payments under other interest-sensitive policies may not be varied by the policyholders. Universal life products include fixed index universal life products. The account value of these policies is credited with interest at a guaranteed rate, plus additional interest credits based on changes in a particular index during a specified time period. 
Traditional Life. These products accounted for $601.7 million, or 16 percent, of our total collected premiums in 2018. Traditional life policies, including whole life, graded benefit life, term life and single premium whole life products, are marketed through independent producers, career agents and direct response marketing. Under whole life policies, the policyholder generally pays a level premium over an agreed period or the policyholder's lifetime. The annual premium in a whole life policy is generally higher than the premium for comparable term insurance coverage in the early years of the policy's life, but is generally lower than the premium for comparable term insurance coverage in the later years of the policy's life. These policies combine insurance protection with a savings component that gradually increases in amount over the life of the policy. The policyholder may borrow against the savings component generally at a rate of interest lower than that available from other lending sources. The policyholder may also choose to surrender the policy and receive the accumulated cash value rather than continuing the insurance protection. Term life products offer pure insurance protection for life with a guaranteed level premium for a specified period of time - typically 5, 10, 15 or 20 years. In some instances, these products offer an option to return the premium at the end of the guaranteed period. 
Traditional life products also include graded benefit life insurance products. Graded benefit life insurance products are offered on an individual basis primarily to persons age 50 to 85, principally in face amounts of $400 to $25,000, without medical examination or evidence of insurability. Premiums are paid as frequently as monthly. Benefits paid are less than the face amount of the policy during the first two years, except in cases of accidental death. Our Colonial Penn segment markets graded benefit life policies under its own brand name using direct response marketing techniques. New policyholder leads are generated primarily from television, print advertisements, direct response mailings and the internet. 
Traditional life products also include single premium whole life insurance. This product requires one initial lump sum payment in return for providing life insurance protection for the insured's entire lifetime. Single premium whole life products accounted for $40.4 million of our total collected premiums in 2018.

INVESTMENTS
40|86 Advisors, Inc. ("40|86 Advisors", a registered investment advisor and wholly owned subsidiary of CNO) manages the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries. 40|86 Advisors had approximately $22.9 billion of assets (at fair value) under management at December 31, 2018, of which $22.8 billion were our assets (including investments held by variable interest entities ("VIEs") that are included on our consolidated balance sheet) and $.1 billion were assets managed for third parties. Our general account investment strategies are to: 

• | provide largely stable investment income from a diversified high quality fixed income portfolio;


• | maximize and maintain a stable spread between our investment income and the yields we pay on insurance products;


• | sustain adequate liquidity levels to meet operating cash requirements, including a margin for potential adverse developments;


• | continually monitor and manage the relationship between our investment portfolio and the financial characteristics of our insurance liabilities such as durations and cash flows; and


• | maximize total return through active strategic asset allocation and investment management.

Investment activities are an important and integral part of our business because investment income is a significant component of our revenues. The profitability of many of our insurance products is significantly affected by spreads between interest yields on investments and rates credited on insurance liabilities. Also, certain insurance products are priced based on long term assumptions including investment returns. Although substantially all credited rates on SPDAs, FPDAs and interest sensitive life products may be changed annually (subject to minimum guaranteed rates), changes in crediting rates may not be sufficient to maintain targeted investment spreads in all economic and market environments. In addition, competition, minimum guaranteed rates and other factors, including the impact of surrenders and withdrawals, may limit our ability to adjust or to maintain crediting rates at levels necessary to avoid narrowing of spreads under certain market conditions. As of December 31, 2018, the average yield, computed on the cost basis of our fixed maturity portfolio, was 5.1 percent, and the average interest rate credited or accruing to our total insurance liabilities (excluding interest rate bonuses for the first policy year only and excluding the effect of credited rates attributable to variable or fixed index products) was 4.6 percent.
We manage the equity-based risk component of our fixed index annuity products by: 

• | purchasing options on equity indices with similar payoff characteristics; and


• | adjusting the participation rate to reflect the change in the cost of such options (such cost varies based on market conditions).

The prices of the options we purchase to manage the equity-based risk component of our fixed index annuities vary based on market conditions. All other factors held constant, the prices of the options generally increase with increases in the volatility of the applicable indices, which may reduce the profitability of the fixed index products, cause us to lower participation rates, or both. Accordingly, volatility of the indices is one factor in the uncertainty regarding the profitability of our fixed index products.
Our invested assets are predominately fixed rate in nature and their value fluctuates with changes in market rates, among other factors (such as changes in the overall compensation for risk required by the market as well as issuer specific changes in credit quality). We seek to manage the interest rate risk inherent in our business by managing the durations and cash flows of our fixed maturity investments along with those of the related insurance liabilities. For example, one management measure we use is asset and liability duration. Duration measures expected change in fair value for a given change in interest rates. If interest rates increase by 1 percent, the fair value of a fixed maturity security with a duration of 5 years is typically expected to decrease in value by approximately 5 percent. When the estimated durations of assets and liabilities are similar, absent other factors, a change in the value of assets related to changes in interest rates should be largely offset by a change in the value of liabilities. We calculate asset and liability durations using our estimates of future asset and liability cash flows. At December 31, 2018, the estimated duration of our fixed income securities (as modified to reflect estimated prepayments and call premiums) and the estimated duration of our insurance liabilities were approximately 8.6 years and 8.4 years, respectively.

COMPETITION
The markets in which we operate are competitive. Compared to CNO, many companies in the financial services industry are larger, have greater capital, technological and marketing resources, have greater access to capital and other sources of liquidity at a lower cost, offer broader and more diversified product lines, have greater brand recognition, have larger staffs and higher ratings. Banks, securities brokerage firms and other financial intermediaries also market insurance products or offer competing products, such as mutual fund products, traditional bank investments and other investment and retirement funding alternatives. We also compete with many of these companies and others in providing services for fees. In most areas, competition is based on a number of factors including pricing, service provided to distributors and policyholders and ratings. CNO's subsidiaries must also compete to attract and retain the allegiance of agents, insurance brokers and marketing companies. 
In the individual health insurance business, companies compete primarily on the bases of marketing, service and price. Pursuant to federal regulations, the Medicare supplement products offered by all companies have standardized policy features. This increases the comparability of such policies and intensifies competition based on other factors. See "Insurance Underwriting" and "Governmental Regulation" for additional information. In addition to competing with the products of other insurance companies, commercial banks, mutual funds and broker dealers, our insurance products compete with health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and other health care-related institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements. 
Our principal competitors vary by product line. Our main competitors for agent-sold long-term care insurance products include Northwestern Mutual, Mutual of Omaha and New York Life. Our main competitors for agent-sold Medicare supplement insurance products include Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans, United HealthCare and Mutual of Omaha. Our main competitors for life insurance sold through direct marketing channels include Gerber Life, Mutual of Omaha, New York Life and subsidiaries of Torchmark Corporation. Our main competitors for supplemental health products sold through our Washington National segment include AFLAC, subsidiaries of Allstate, Colonial Life and Accident Company and subsidiaries of Torchmark Corporation.
In some of our product lines, such as life insurance and fixed annuities, we have a relatively small market share. Even in some of the lines in which we are one of the top writers, our market share is relatively small. For example, while, based on an Individual Long-Term Care Insurance Survey, our Bankers Life subsidiary ranked sixth in new annualized premiums of individual long-term care insurance in the first half of 2018 with a market share of approximately 7 percent, the top five writers of individual long-term care insurance had new annualized premiums with a combined market share of approximately 79 percent during the period. In addition, while, based on a 2017 Medicare Supplement Loss Ratios report, we ranked sixth in direct premiums earned for Medicare supplement insurance in 2017 with a market share of 2.7 percent, the top writer of Medicare supplement insurance had direct premiums with a market share of 35 percent during the period. 
Most of our major competitors have higher financial strength ratings than we do. Recent industry consolidation, including business combinations among insurance and other financial services companies, has resulted in larger competitors with even greater financial resources. Furthermore, changes in federal law have narrowed the historical separation between banks and insurance companies, enabling traditional banking institutions to enter the insurance and annuity markets and further increase competition. This increased competition may harm our ability to maintain or improve our profitability. 
In addition, because the actual cost of products is unknown when they are sold, we are subject to competitors who may sell a product at a price that does not cover its actual cost. Accordingly, if we do not also lower our prices for similar products, we may lose market share to these competitors. If we lower our prices to maintain market share, our profitability will decline. 
The Colonial Penn segment has faced increased competition from other insurance companies who also distribute products through direct marketing. In addition, the demand and cost of television advertising appropriate for Colonial Penn's campaigns fluctuates from period to period and will impact the average cost to generate a TV lead.
We must attract and retain sales representatives to sell our insurance and annuity products. Strong competition exists among insurance and financial services companies for sales representatives. We compete for sales representatives primarily on the basis of our financial position, financial strength ratings, support services, compensation, products and product features. Our competitiveness for such agents also depends upon the relationships we develop with these agents. 
An important competitive factor for life insurance companies is the financial strength ratings they receive from nationally recognized rating organizations. Agents, insurance brokers and marketing companies who market our products and 
13


prospective purchasers of our products use the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries as an important factor in determining whether to market or purchase. Ratings have the most impact on our sales of supplemental health and life products to consumers at the worksite. Financial strength ratings provided by A.M. Best Company ("A.M. Best"), Moody's Investor Services, Inc. ("Moody's"), Fitch Ratings ("Fitch") and S&P Global Ratings ("S&P") are the rating agency's opinions of the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay policyholder claims and obligations when due. They are not directed toward the protection of investors, and such ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. The most recent ratings actions are described below.
On January 9, 2019, A.M. Best affirmed its "A-" financial strength ratings of our primary insurance subsidiaries. The outlook for these ratings remains stable. The "A-" rating is assigned to companies that have an excellent ability, in A.M. Best's opinion, to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders.  A.M. Best ratings for the industry currently range from "A++ (Superior)" to "F (In Liquidation)" and some companies are not rated.  An "A++" rating indicates a superior ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders.  A.M. Best has sixteen possible ratings.  There are three ratings above the "A-" rating of our primary insurance subsidiaries and twelve ratings that are below that rating.
On October 4, 2018, Moody's upgraded the financial strength ratings of our primary insurance subsidiaries to "A3" from "Baa1" and the outlook for these ratings is stable. Moody's actions resulted from the Company's announcement that Bankers Life had closed on its agreement to cede certain long-term care policies as further described in the note to the consolidated financial statements entitled "Reinsurance". Moody’s financial strength ratings range from "Aaa" to "C".  These ratings may be supplemented with numbers "1", "2", or "3" to show relative standing within a category.  In Moody's view, an insurer rated "A" offers good financial security, however, certain elements may be present which suggests a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future. Moody's has twenty-one possible ratings.  There are six ratings above the "A3" rating of our primary insurance subsidiaries and fourteen ratings that are below that rating.
On August 2, 2018, Fitch affirmed its "BBB+" financial strength ratings of our primary insurance subsidiaries and revised the outlook for these ratings to positive from stable. The positive outlook for these ratings reflected Fitch's view that such ratings could be upgraded over the next 12 to 18 months based on the Company's announcement that Bankers Life had entered into an agreement to cede certain long-term care policies as further described in the note to the consolidated financial statements entitled "Reinsurance". A "BBB" rating, in Fitch's opinion, indicates that there is currently a low expectation of ceased or interrupted payments. The capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations on a timely basis is considered adequate, but adverse changes in circumstances and economic conditions are more likely to impact this capacity. Fitch ratings for the industry range from "AAA Exceptionally Strong" to "C Distressed" and some companies are not rated. Pluses and minuses show the relative standing within a category. Fitch has nineteen possible ratings. There are seven ratings above the "BBB+" rating of our primary insurance subsidiaries and eleven ratings that are below that rating.
On August 2, 2018, S&P affirmed the financial strength ratings of "BBB+" of our primary insurance subsidiaries and revised the outlook for these ratings to positive from stable. S&P's actions resulted from the Company's announcement that Bankers Life had entered into an agreement to cede certain long-term care policies as further described in the note to the consolidated financial statements entitled "Reinsurance". S&P financial strength ratings range from "AAA" to "R" and some companies are not rated.  An insurer rated "BBB" or higher is regarded as having financial security characteristics that outweigh any vulnerabilities, and is highly likely to have the ability to meet financial commitments. An insurer rated "BBB", in S&P's opinion, has good financial security characteristics, but is more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are higher-rated insurers.  Pluses and minuses show the relative standing within a category.  S&P has twenty-one possible ratings.  There are seven ratings above the "BBB+" rating of our primary insurance subsidiaries and thirteen ratings that are below that rating.
Rating agencies have increased the frequency and scope of their credit reviews and requested additional information from the companies that they rate, including us.  They may also adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels.  We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response.  Accordingly, downgrades and outlook revisions related to us or the life insurance industry may occur in the future at any time and without notice by any rating agency.  These could increase policy surrenders and withdrawals, adversely affect relationships with our distribution channels, reduce new sales, reduce our ability to borrow and increase our future borrowing costs.

INSURANCE UNDERWRITING
Under regulations developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the "NAIC") (an association of state regulators and their staffs) and adopted by the states, we are prohibited from underwriting our Medicare supplement policies for certain first-time purchasers. If a person applies for insurance within six months after becoming eligible by reason of age, or disability in certain limited circumstances, the application may not be rejected due to medical conditions. Some states prohibit underwriting of all Medicare supplement policies. For other prospective Medicare supplement policyholders, such as senior citizens who are transferring to our products, the underwriting procedures are relatively limited, except for policies providing prescription drug coverage. 
Before issuing long-term care products, we generally apply detailed underwriting procedures to assess and quantify the insurance risks. We require medical examinations of applicants (including blood and urine tests, where permitted) for certain health insurance products and for life insurance products which exceed prescribed policy amounts. These requirements vary according to the applicant's age and may vary by type of policy or product. We also rely on medical records and the potential policyholder's written application. In recent years, there have been significant regulatory changes with respect to underwriting certain types of health insurance. An increasing number of states prohibit underwriting and/or charging higher premiums for substandard risks. We monitor changes in state regulation that affect our products, and consider these regulatory developments in determining the products we market and where we market them. 
Our supplemental health policies are individually underwritten using a simplified issue application. Based on an applicant's responses on the application, the underwriter either: (i) approves the policy as applied for; (ii) approves the policy with reduced benefits; or (iii) rejects the application. 
Our life insurance products include policies that are underwritten individually and low face-amount life insurance products that utilize standardized underwriting procedures. After initial processing, insurance underwriters obtain the information needed to make an underwriting decision (such as medical examinations, doctors' statements and special medical tests). After collecting and reviewing the information, the underwriter either: (i) approves the policy as applied for; (ii) approves the policy with an extra premium charge because of unfavorable factors; or (iii) rejects the application. 
We underwrite group insurance policies based on the characteristics of the group and its past claim experience. Graded benefit life insurance policies are issued without medical examination or evidence of insurability. There is minimal underwriting on annuities. 
LIABILITIES FOR INSURANCE PRODUCTS
At December 31, 2018, the total balance of our liabilities for insurance products was $23.5 billion. These liabilities are generally payable over an extended period of time. The profitability of our insurance products depends on pricing and other factors. Differences between our expectations when we sold these products and our actual experience could result in future losses. 
Liabilities for insurance products are calculated using management's best judgments, based on our past experience and standard actuarial tables, of mortality, morbidity, lapse rates, investment experience and expense levels with due consideration of provision for adverse development where prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). For all of our insurance products, we establish an active life reserve, a liability for due and unpaid claims, claims in the course of settlement and incurred but not reported claims. In addition, for our health insurance business, we establish a reserve for the present value of amounts not yet due on incurred claims. Many factors can affect these reserves and liabilities, such as economic and social conditions, inflation, hospital and pharmaceutical costs, changes in doctrines of legal liability and extra-contractual damage awards. Therefore, our reserves and liabilities are necessarily based on extensive estimates, assumptions and historical experience. Establishing reserves is an uncertain process, and it is possible that actual claims will materially exceed our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our financial results depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we used in determining our reserves and pricing our products. If our assumptions are incorrect with respect to future claims, future policyholder premiums and policy charges or the investment income on assets supporting liabilities, or our reserves are insufficient to cover our actual losses and expenses, we would be required to increase our liabilities, which would negatively affect our operating results. 
15


REINSURANCE
Consistent with the general practice of the life insurance industry, our subsidiaries enter into indemnity reinsurance agreements with other insurance companies in order to reinsure portions of the coverage provided by our insurance products. Indemnity reinsurance agreements are intended to limit a life insurer's maximum loss on a large or unusually hazardous risk or to diversify its risk. Indemnity reinsurance does not discharge the original insurer's primary liability to the insured. Our reinsured business is ceded to numerous reinsurers. Based on our periodic review of their financial statements, insurance industry reports and reports filed with state insurance departments, we believe the assuming companies are able to honor all contractual commitments. 
As of December 31, 2018, the policy risk retention limit of our insurance subsidiaries was generally $.8 million or less. Reinsurance ceded by CNO represented 12 percent of gross combined life insurance inforce and reinsurance assumed represented .5 percent of net combined life insurance inforce. Our principal reinsurers at December 31, 2018 were as follows (dollars in millions):

Name of Reinsurer | Reinsurance receivables | | Ceded life insurance inforce | | A.M. Best rating
Wilton Re (a) | $ | 3,046.4 | | | $ | 1,129.8 | | A+
Jackson National Life Insurance Company ("Jackson") (b) | 1,323.8 | | | 642.3 | | | A+
RGA Reinsurance Company (c) | 258.0 | | | 102.9 | | | A+
Swiss Re Life and Health America Inc. | 3.7 | | | 636.3 | | | A+
Munich American Reassurance Company | 3.2 | | | 518.5 | | | A+
SCOR Global Life USA Reinsurance Company | 1.3 | | | 80.9 | | | A+
All others (d) | 289.0 | | | 210.6 | | | 
 | $ | 4,925.4 | | | $ | 3,321.3 | | 

________________ 

(a) | In addition to the life insurance business, Wilton Re has assumed certain long-term care business through a 100% indemnity coinsurance agreement. Such business had total insurance policy liabilities of $2.8 billion at December 31, 2018. 


(b) | In addition to the life insurance business, Jackson has assumed certain annuity business from our insurance subsidiaries through a coinsurance agreement. Such business had total insurance policy liabilities of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2018. 


(c) | RGA Reinsurance Company has assumed a portion of the long-term care business of Bankers Life on a coinsurance basis.


(d) | No other single reinsurer represents more than 3 percent of the reinsurance receivables balance or has assumed greater than 2 percent of the total ceded life insurance business inforce.

EMPLOYEES
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 3,300 full time employees, including 1,280 employees supporting our Bankers Life segment, 290 employees supporting our Colonial Penn segment and 1,730 employees supporting our shared services and our Washington National, long-term care in run-off and corporate segments. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relations with our employees. 
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION
Insurance Regulation and Oversight
Our insurance businesses are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the insurance regulatory agencies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. This regulation and supervision is primarily for the benefit and protection of customers, and not for the benefit of investors or creditors. State laws generally establish supervisory agencies that have broad regulatory authority, including the power to:

• | grant and revoke business licenses;


• | regulate and supervise sales practices and market conduct;

16



• | establish guaranty associations;


• | license agents;


• | approve policy forms;


• | approve premium rates and premium rate increases for some lines of business such as long-term care and Medicare supplement;


• | establish reserve requirements;


• | prescribe the form and content of required financial statements and reports;


• | determine the reasonableness and adequacy of statutory capital and surplus;


• | perform financial, market conduct and other examinations;


• | define acceptable accounting principles; and


• | regulate the types and amounts of permitted investments.

In addition, the NAIC develops model laws and regulations, many of which have been adopted by state legislators and/or insurance regulators, relating to:

• | reserve requirements;


• | risk-based capital ("RBC") standards;


• | codification of insurance accounting principles;


• | investment restrictions;


• | restrictions on an insurance company's ability to pay dividends;


• | credit for reinsurance; and


• | product illustrations.

The Company's insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed annual reports, in accordance with prescribed statutory accounting rules, with regulatory authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which they do business. As part of their routine oversight process, state insurance departments conduct periodic detailed examinations, generally once every three to five years, of the books, records and accounts of insurers domiciled in their states. These examinations are generally coordinated under the direction of the lead state and typically include all insurers operating in a holding company system pursuant to guidelines promulgated by the NAIC.
The NAIC has developed a principle-based reserving approach for life insurance products which will replace the current formulaic approach to determining policy reserves with an approach that more closely reflects the risks of the products. The principle-based approach became effective on January 1, 2017, and there is a three-year transition period where the approach is optional until it is required to be used for all life insurance products issued on or after January 1, 2020. The new approach will impact the financial statements of our insurance subsidiaries prepared under statutory accounting principles prescribed or permitted by regulatory authorities. The Company is implementing the new approach to its reserves on new life insurance products as they are introduced through the transition period.
State regulatory authorities and industry groups have developed several initiatives regarding market conduct, including the form and content of disclosures to consumers, advertising, sales practices and complaint handling. Various state insurance departments periodically examine the market conduct activities of domestic and non-domestic insurance companies doing business in their states, including our insurance subsidiaries. The purpose of these market conduct examinations is to determine if operations are consistent with the laws and regulations of the state conducting the examination. In addition, market conduct 
17


has become one of the criteria used by rating agencies to establish the financial strength ratings of an insurance company. For example, A.M. Best's ratings analysis now includes a review of the insurer's compliance program.
Most states mandate minimum benefit standards and benefit ratios for accident and health insurance policies. We are generally required to maintain, with respect to our individual long-term care policies, minimum anticipated benefit ratios over the entire period of coverage of not less than 60 percent. With respect to our Medicare supplement policies, we are generally required to attain and maintain an actual benefit ratio, after three years, of not less than 65 percent. We provide to the insurance departments of all states in which we conduct business annual calculations that demonstrate compliance with required minimum benefit ratios for both long-term care and Medicare supplement insurance. These calculations are prepared utilizing statutory lapse and interest rate assumptions. In the event that we fail to maintain minimum mandated benefit ratios, our insurance subsidiaries could be required to provide retrospective refunds and/or prospective rate reductions. We believe that our insurance subsidiaries currently comply with all applicable mandated minimum benefit ratios.
Our insurance subsidiaries are required, under guaranty fund laws of most states, to pay assessments up to prescribed limits to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of insolvent insurance companies. Typically, assessments are levied on member insurers on a basis which is related to the member insurer's proportionate share of the business written by all member insurers. Assessments can be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes in some states.
The NAIC has adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act ("ORSA"), which has been enacted by each of our insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states. ORSA requires that insurers maintain a risk management framework and conduct an internal own risk and solvency assessment of the insurer’s material risks in normal and stressed environments. The assessment must be documented in an annual summary report, a copy of which must be submitted to insurance regulators as required or upon request.
The NAIC has adopted the Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Act ("CGAD"), which has been enacted by our lead state insurance regulator. CGAD requires an annual filing by an insurer or insurance group that provides a detailed narrative and sample documentation on corporate governance structure and policies and practices.
The NAIC has adopted a model law governing cybersecurity consumer protections in 2017 with enactment by states thereafter. In addition, effective March 1, 2017, the New York Department of Financial Services (the "NYDFS") has a new cybersecurity regulation which includes transitional phase-in periods up to two years. An annual Certification of Compliance involving our cybersecurity program is required to be filed with the NYDFS.
Insurance Holding Company Regulations
All U.S. jurisdictions in which our insurers conduct business, except the Virgin Islands, have enacted laws or regulations regarding the activities of insurance holding company systems, including acquisitions, the terms of surplus debentures, the terms of transactions between or involving insurance companies and their affiliates and other related matters. Various reporting and approval requirements apply to transactions between or involving insurance companies and their affiliates within an insurance holding company system, depending on the size and nature of the transactions. Generally, all transactions between an insurance company and an affiliate must be fair and reasonable. Currently, the Company and its insurance subsidiaries are registered as a holding company system pursuant to such laws and regulations in the domiciliary states of the insurance subsidiaries.
All U.S. jurisdictions in which our insurers conduct business, except the Virgin Islands, have also enacted legislation or regulations that affect the acquisition (or sale) of control of insurance companies. The nature and extent of such legislation and regulations vary from state to state. Generally, these regulations require an acquirer of control to file detailed information and the plan of acquisition, and to obtain administrative approval prior to the acquisition of control. "Control" is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is rebuttably presumed to exist if a person or group of affiliated persons directly or indirectly owns or controls 10 percent or more of the voting securities of another person.
Insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of dividends or other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to parent companies if they determine that such payment could be adverse to our policyholders or contract holders. Otherwise, the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to state insurance department regulations and is based on the financial statements of our insurance subsidiaries prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by regulatory authorities, which differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These regulations generally permit dividends to be paid by the insurance company if such dividends are not in excess of unassigned surplus and, for any 12-month period, are in amounts less than the greater of, or in some states, the lesser of:
18



• | statutory net gain from operations or statutory net income for the prior year; or


• | 10 percent of statutory capital and surplus at the end of the preceding year.

If an insurance company has negative earned surplus, any dividend payments require the prior approval of the director or commissioner of the applicable state insurance department.
In accordance with an order from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, Washington National may not distribute funds to any affiliate or shareholder, except pursuant to agreements with affiliates that have been approved, without prior notice to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. In addition, the RBC and other capital requirements described below can also limit, in certain circumstances, the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends.
Insurance regulations require an annual enterprise risk report that identifies the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the insurer and which must be submitted to insurance regulators as required.
Long-Term Care Regulations
The NAIC has adopted model long-term care policy language providing nonforfeiture benefits and has proposed a rate stabilization standard for long-term care policies. Various bills are introduced from time to time in the U.S. Congress which propose the implementation of certain minimum consumer protection standards in all long-term care policies, including guaranteed renewability, protection against inflation and limitations on waiting periods for pre-existing conditions. Federal legislation permits premiums paid for qualified long-term care insurance to be tax-deductible medical expenses and for benefits received on such policies to be excluded from taxable income.
Our insurance subsidiaries that have long-term care business have made insurance regulatory filings seeking actuarially justified rate increases on our long-term care policies. Most of our long-term care business is guaranteed renewable, and, if necessary rate increases are not approved, we may be required to write off all or a portion of the deferred acquisition costs and the present value of future profits (collectively referred to as "insurance acquisition costs") and establish a premium deficiency reserve. If we are unable to raise our premium rates because we fail to obtain approval for actuarially justified rate increases in one or more states, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Capital Requirements
Using statutory statements filed with state regulators annually, the NAIC calculates certain financial ratios to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies. A "usual range" of results for each ratio is used as a benchmark. An insurance company may fall out of the usual range for one or more ratios because of specific transactions that are in themselves immaterial or eliminated at the consolidated level. Generally, an insurance company will become subject to regulatory scrutiny if it falls outside the usual ranges of four or more of the ratios, and regulators may then act, if the company has insufficient capital, to constrain the company's underwriting capacity. In the past, variances in certain ratios of our insurance subsidiaries have resulted in inquiries from insurance departments, to which we have responded. These inquiries have not led to any restrictions affecting our operations.
The NAIC's RBC requirements provide a tool for insurance regulators to determine the levels of statutory capital and surplus an insurer must maintain in relation to its insurance and investment risks and the need for possible regulatory attention. The basis of the system is a formula that applies prescribed factors to various risk elements in an insurer’s business to report a minimum capital requirement proportional to the amount of risk assumed by the insurer. The life and health insurer RBC formula is designed to measure annually: (i) the risk of loss from asset defaults and asset value fluctuations; (ii) the risk of loss from adverse mortality and morbidity experience; (iii) the risk of loss from mismatching of assets and liability cash flow due to changing interest rates; and (iv) business risks. 
In addition, the RBC requirements currently provide for a trend test if a company's total adjusted capital is between 100 percent and 150 percent of its RBC at the end of the year. The trend test calculates the greater of the decrease in the margin of total adjusted capital over RBC:

• | between the current year and the prior year; and


• | for the average of the last 3 years.

19


It assumes that such decrease could occur again in the coming year. Any company whose trended total adjusted capital is less than 95 percent of its RBC would trigger a requirement to submit a comprehensive plan to the regulatory authority proposing corrective actions aimed at improving its capital position. The 2018 statutory annual statements of each of our insurance subsidiaries reflect total adjusted capital in excess of the levels that would subject our subsidiaries to any regulatory action.
Although we are under no obligation to do so, we may elect to contribute additional capital or retain greater amounts of capital to strengthen the surplus of certain insurance subsidiaries. Any election to contribute or retain additional capital could impact the amounts our insurance subsidiaries pay as dividends to the holding company. The ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is also impacted by various criteria established by rating agencies to maintain or receive higher ratings and by the capital levels that we target for our insurance subsidiaries.
The NAIC is working to develop a group capital measure to be utilized as an analytical tool to supplement the existing holding company analysis as opposed to a capital standard. The measure is expected to be based on the aggregation of existing regulatory capital calculations for all entities within the insurance holding company system.
Regulation of Investments
Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain investment categories, such as below-investment grade bonds, equity real estate and common stocks. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus, and, in some instances, would require divestiture of such non-qualifying investments. The investments made by our insurance subsidiaries complied in all material respects with such investment regulations as of December 31, 2018. 
Other Federal and State Laws and Regulations
Federal and state law and regulation require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of personal information, including health-related and customer information, and to notify customers and other individuals about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of health-related and customer information and their practices relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. State laws regulate use and disclosure of social security numbers and federal and state laws require notice to affected individuals, law enforcement, regulators and others if there is a breach of the security of certain personal information, including social security numbers. Federal and state laws and regulations regulate the ability of financial institutions to make telemarketing calls and to send unsolicited e-mail or fax messages to consumers and customers. Federal and state lawmakers and regulatory bodies may be expected to consider additional or more detailed regulation regarding these subjects and the privacy and security of personal information. The United States Department of Health and Human Services has issued regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act relating to standardized electronic transaction formats, code sets and the privacy of member health information. These regulations, and any corresponding state legislation, affect our administration of health insurance.
The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 seeks to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism, money laundering or other illegal activities. To the extent required by applicable laws and regulations, CNO and its insurance subsidiaries have adopted anti-money laundering ("AML") programs that include policies, procedures and controls to detect and prevent money laundering, have designated compliance officers to oversee the programs, provide for on-going employee training and ensure periodic independent testing of the programs. CNO's and the insurance subsidiaries' AML programs, to the extent required, also establish and enforce customer identification programs and provide for the monitoring and the reporting to the Department of the Treasury of certain suspicious transactions.
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") generally provides for enhanced federal supervision of financial institutions, including insurance companies in certain circumstances, and financial activities that represent a systemic risk to financial stability or the U.S. economy. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, a Federal Insurance Office has been established within the U.S. Treasury Department to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and its authority will likely extend to most lines of insurance that are written by the Company, although the Federal Insurance Office is not empowered with any general regulatory authority over insurers. The director of the Federal Insurance Office serves in an advisory capacity to the newly established Financial Stability Oversight Council and will have the ability to recommend that an insurance company or an insurance holding company be subject to heightened prudential standards by the Federal Reserve, if it is determined that financial distress at the company could pose a threat to financial stability in the U.S.

The Dodd-Frank Act also provides for the preemption of state laws when inconsistent with certain international agreements, and would streamline the state-level regulation of reinsurance and surplus lines insurance. Under certain circumstances, the FDIC can assume the role of a state insurance regulator and initiate liquidation proceedings under state law.
The asset management activities of 40|86 Advisors and our other investment advisory subsidiary are subject to various federal and state securities laws and regulations. The SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are the principal regulators of our asset management operations.
Broker-Dealer and Securities Regulation
We have a broker-dealer subsidiary that is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is subject to federal and state regulation, including, but not limited to, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"). Agents and employees registered or associated with our broker-dealer subsidiary are subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and to examination requirements and regulation by the SEC, FINRA and state securities commissioners. The SEC and other governmental agencies, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., have the power to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension and termination or limitation of the activities of the regulated entity or its employees.
FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION
On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (the "Tax Reform Act") which enacted a broad range of changes to the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") including individual and corporate reforms and numerous changes to U.S. international tax provisions. The Tax Reform Act reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent and made significant changes to the taxation of life insurance companies. Among other things, the Tax Reform Act modified the computation of life insurance reserves, increased the capitalization rate and extended the amortization period for policy acquisition costs, imposed limitations on the deductibility of performance-based compensation to "covered employees" and interest expense, and allowed for the expensing of certain capital expenditures. For net operating losses ("NOLs") arising after December 31, 2017, the Tax Reform Act limits the ability to utilize NOL carryforwards to 80% of taxable income. In addition, NOLs arising after 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but carryback is prohibited. Our net deferred tax assets and liabilities were revalued at the newly enacted U.S. corporate rate, and the impact was recognized in our tax expense in 2017, the year of enactment.
Our annuity and life insurance products generally provide policyholders with an income tax advantage, as compared to other savings investments such as certificates of deposit and bonds, because taxes on the increase in value of the products are deferred until received by policyholders. With other savings investments, the increase in value is generally taxed as earned. Annuity benefits and life insurance benefits, which accrue prior to the death of the policyholder, are generally not taxable until paid. Life insurance death benefits are generally exempt from income tax. Also, benefits received on immediate annuities (other than structured settlements) are recognized as taxable income ratably, as opposed to the methods used for some other investments which tend to accelerate taxable income into earlier years. The tax advantage for annuities and life insurance is provided in the Code and is generally followed in all states and other United States taxing jurisdictions. 
Congress has considered, from time to time, possible changes to the U.S. tax laws, including elimination of the tax deferral on the accretion of value of certain annuities and life insurance products. It is possible that further tax legislation will be enacted which would contain provisions with possible adverse effects on our annuity and life insurance products. 
Our insurance company subsidiaries are taxed under the life insurance company provisions of the Code. Provisions in the Code require a portion of the expenses incurred in selling insurance products to be deducted over a period of years, as opposed to immediate deduction in the year incurred. This provision increases the tax for statutory accounting purposes, which reduces statutory earnings and surplus and, accordingly, decreases the amount of cash dividends that may be paid by the life insurance subsidiaries. 
Our income tax expense includes deferred income taxes arising from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, capital loss carryforwards and NOLs. In evaluating our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends upon generating future taxable income during the periods in which our temporary differences become deductible and before our NOLs expire. In addition, the use of our NOLs is dependent, in part, on whether the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") ultimately agrees with the tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns and that we plan to take in future tax returns. Accordingly, with respect to our deferred tax assets, we assess the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis.

As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we have established a valuation allowance equal to the portion of the net deferred tax assets whose realization is uncertain. The determination of the amount of valuation allowance established is made by assessing the effects of limitations or issues on the value of our net deferred tax assets expected to be fully recognized in the future.
