ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

 
AmeriCann, Inc. is a specialized cannabis company that is developing state-of-the-art product manufacturing and greenhouse cultivation facilities. Our business plan is based on the continued growth of the regulated marijuana market in the United States.
 
AmeriCann uses greenhouse technology which is superior to the current industry standard of growing cannabis in warehouse facilities under artificial lights. According to industry experts, by capturing natural sunlight, greenhouses use 25 percent fewer light bulbs, and utility bills are up to 75 percent less than in typical warehouse cultivation facilities. As such, AmeriCann’s Cannopy System enables cannabis to be produced with a greatly reduced carbon footprint, making the final product less expensive. Additionally, greenhouse construction costs are nearly half of warehouse construction costs. AmeriCann’s business is committed to sustainable, clean cultivation of medical cannabis and to social and environmental ethics, transparency and accountability.
 
AmeriCann’s team includes board members, expert consultants, engineers and architects who specialize in real estate development, traditional horticulture, lean manufacturing, medical research, facility construction, regulatory compliance, security, marijuana cultivation and genetics, extraction processes, and infused product development.
 
AmeriCann has designed with AmeriCann’s propriety cultivation and processing system called “Cannopy.” AmeriCann developed Cannopy with experts from traditional horticulture, lean manufacturing, regulatory compliance and cannabis cultivation. Cannopy includes automation throughout the production life-cycle, customized workflow processes, monitoring and controls, and top-line security systems. Cannopy will consistently produce cannabis for patients and consumers at the lowest cost in the most efficient, compliant manner. We provide initial and on-going training, policies, practices and procedures to operate the state-of-the-art facilities.
 
To support local businesses that seek to serve cannabis patients and consumers in their communities we initiated the AmeriCann Preferred Partner Program. Currently, we have one Preferred Partner in Massachusetts, which is Bask, Inc. (f/k/a Coastal Compassion Inc.) (“BASK”) Through this program, we plan to provide an essential set of resources including advanced cultivation facilities, access to a team of experts and in certain cases, capital for our partner’s businesses. In addition, AmeriCann’s team has assisted applicants in obtaining cannabis licenses in competitive application processes in Massachusetts and Illinois. This support is designed to assist our Preferred Partners in newly regulated markets.
 
The expanding cannabis industry requires extensive real estate to meet the growing needs of the market for cannabis products. AmeriCann assists our Preferred Partners with the identification, design, permitting, acquisition, development and operation of scalable infrastructure to cultivate and to dispense medical cannabis in regulated markets.
 
Company History
 
We were organized under the laws of Delaware on June 25, 2010.
 
On January 17, 2014, Strategic Capital Partners, LLC (“SCP”) a firm controlled by Benjamin J. Barton, one of our officers and directors, acquired 14,950,000 shares of our outstanding common stock from a group of our shareholders.

On February 21, 2014, the Company’s board of directors declared a stock dividend in the amount of four shares of common stock for each issued and outstanding share of common stock. On February 24, 2014, SCP returned 65,750,000 shares of our common stock to us. These shares were cancelled and returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares.
 
Massachusetts Medical Cannabis Center
 
Massachusetts Medical Cannabis Center (MMCC), is a one million square foot sustainable greenhouse facility in Freetown, Mass which is being developed by us. The first phase of the facility is under construction and is scheduled to open and be ready for cannabis cultivation, processing, and infused product production in the middle of 2019. Once fully developed, the MMCC design calls for a research facility, a training center, corporate offices, a quality-assurance laboratory, and a facility for manufacturing cannabis-infused food, nutraceuticals and consumer packaged cannabis goods. We intend to open similar facilities in states in which cannabis is legal for medical and adult use.
 
On January 14, 2015, we entered into an agreement to purchase a 52.6 acre parcel of undeveloped land in Freetown, Massachusetts. The property is located approximately 47 miles southeast of Boston. We are developing the property as the Massachusetts Medical Cannabis Center (“MMCC”). Plans for the MMCC include the construction of sustainable greenhouse cultivation and processing facilities that will be leased to Registered Marijuana Dispensaries under the Massachusetts Medical Marijuana and Adult use Programs. Additional plans for the MMCC may include a testing laboratory, a research facility, a training center, an infused product production facility and corporate offices. 
 
On December 8, 2015, The Town of Freetown Planning Board unanimously approved our site plan application for the MMCC. The site plan application requested 977,000 square feet of infrastructure for medical marijuana cultivation, processing, testing and associated administration in Freetown's Industrial Park. 
 
On March 29, 2016, the Department of Public Health (“DPH”) for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts approved our consulting agreement and development agreement relating to the MMCC's first tenant and Preferred Partner, BASK.
 
On April 7, 2016, we signed agreements with BASK. BASK is one of a limited number of non-profit organizations that has received a provisional or final registration to cultivate, process and sell medical cannabis by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. BASK has agreed to become the initial tenant in our planned MMCC. Tim Keogh, our Chief Executive Officer, is a Board Member of BASK.
 
Although the DPH has approved our agreement with BASK relating to the development and lease terms of the MMCC, the actual lease agreement with BASK has not been finalized or approved by the DPH. We will need to secure significant capital to provide the financing to BASK.
 
On October 17, 2016, the Company closed the acquisition of the 52.6-acre parcel of undeveloped land in Freetown, Massachusetts. The deposits of $925,000 previously paid by the Company to the seller, Boston Beer Company (“BBC”), were credited against the total purchase price of $4,475,000. The remaining balance of $3,550,000 was paid to BBC by Massachusetts Medical Properties, LLC (“MMP”).
 
As part of a simultaneous transaction, the Company assigned the property rights to MMP for a nominal fee and entered a lease agreement pursuant to which MMP agreed to lease the property to the Company for an initial term of fifty (50) years. We have the option to extend the term of the lease for four (4) additional ten (10) year periods. The lease is a triple net lease, with the Company paying all real estate taxes, repairs, maintenance and insurance.
 
The lease payments are the greater of (a) $30,000 per month; (b) $0.38 per square foot per month of any structure built on the property; or (c) 1.5% of all gross monthly sales of products sold by the Company, any assignee of the Company, or any subtenant of the Company. The lease payments will be adjusted up (but not down) every five (5) years by any increase in the Consumer Price Index.
 
Between October 17, 2016 and April 17, 2017, the monthly lease payments accrued, with all accrued lease payments paid to MMP on April 17, 2017. On April 17, 2017, the Company reimbursed MMP’s costs and expenses associated with the acquisition of the property, the lease, and the acquisition of the shares and the warrant from the Company (as further described below).
 
The Company received a credit for the $925,000 paid towards the purchase price of the land in the form of discounted lease payments. For the initial fifty (50) year term of the lease, the lease payments are reduced by $1,542 each month.
 
In connection with the sale of the property to MMP and the lease, the Company and MMP entered into a Share Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Company issued to MMP 100,000 shares of its common stock at par value of $0.0001 (“Common Stock”), and a warrant to purchase up to 3,640,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. The warrant can be exercised at any time on or after October 17, 2018 and on or before October 17, 2020. The warrant does not contain a cashless exercise provision.

Under the terms of the lease, the Company had six (6) months to obtain $2.6 million in capital funding for the construction of the first phase building. In the event that the Company was unable to raise these funds within the six (6) month period, the Company had an additional six (6) month period to do so; provided, that the Company has paid accrued lease payments and closing costs. If the Company was then unable to raise these funds on or before twelve (12) months from October 17, 2016, the lease would terminate. On October 17, 2017, the lease agreement was amended to provide that the Company had until 16 months from October 17, 2016 to raise $2.6 million in capital funding. In addition to extending the funding deadline, this amendment granted MMP warrants to purchase up to 100,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.50 per share. The warrants can be exercised at any time on or after October 17, 2017 and on or before October 17, 2022.
 
In February and April, 2018, the lease agreement was amended to provide that the Company will have until 20 months from October 17, 2016 to raise $2.6 million in capital funding. In addition to extending the funding deadline, this amendment granted MMP a warrant to purchase up to 100,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $1.50 per share. The warrant can be exercised at any time on or before October 17, 2022. The Company recognized an expense of $432,787 during the year ended September 30, 2018, representing the entire grant date fair value of the warrants issued for the above amendments.
 
Market Conditions
 
Adult-Use marijuana is now legal in ten states and the District of Columbia, and medical marijuana is legal in 33 states.
 
While the industry is growing rapidly, the cannabis industry faces several major obstacles that challenge its growth and profitability. First, the cultivation of cannabis is a very capital-intensive enterprise. Many cannabis entrepreneurs do not have access to the capital required to build the infrastructure required to meet growing demand and sales projections. Traditional sources of financing, such as banks, are not available currently to cannabis producers and retailers in the United States. Second, there is a significant shortage of knowledge related to virtually all areas of the cannabis business. When new states are added to the list of regulated cannabis markets, there is a scarcity of experience and expertise to serve the needs of cultivators, processors and retailers in these states. As explained below, marijuana is illegal under federal law. These obstacles to the cannabis industry require financial resources, expertise and dedicated advocacy to change regulations on the state level.
Government Regulation
 
Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law.
 
A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department of Justice defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act with respect to marijuana, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
As of December 1, 2018, 33 states and the District of Columbia allow their citizens to use Medical Marijuana. Additionally, 10 states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for recreational use by adults. The state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. The Trump administration has indicated that it is not opposed to the legalization of marijuana. Any change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us and our shareholders. While we do not intend to harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal government or the enactment of new and more restrictive laws.
 
Competition
 
Currently, there are a number of other companies that are involved in the marijuana industry, many of which we consider to be our competition. Many of these companies provide services similar to those which we provide or plan to provide. We expect that other companies will recognize the value of serving the marijuana industry and become our competitors.
General
 
In January 2018 our offices moved to 1550 Wewatta St, Denver, CO 80202. We lease this new space on a month-to-month basis at a rate of $1,230 per month.
