Item 1. BUSINESS
 
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
General
 
theglobe.com, inc. (the “Company,” “theglobe,” “we” or “us”) was incorporated on May 1, 1995 and commenced operations on that date. Originally, we were an online community with registered members and users in the United States and abroad. On September 29, 2008, we consummated the sale of the business and substantially all of the assets of our subsidiary, Tralliance Corporation (“Tralliance”), to Tralliance Registry Management Company, LLC (“Tralliance Registry Management”), an entity controlled by Michael S. Egan, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result of and on the effective date of the sale of our Tralliance business, which was our last remaining operating business, we became a “shell company,” as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, with no material operations or assets.

As discussed below, on December 20, 2017, Delfin Midstream LLC (“Delfin”) entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with certain of our stockholders for the purchase of a total of 312,825,952 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”), representing approximately 70.9% of our Common Stock. On December 31, 2017 (the “Closing Date”), Mr. Egan, Edward A. Cespedes and Robin S. Lebowitz resigned from their respective positions as officers and directors of the Company. William “Rusty” Nichols was appointed the sole member of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and our sole executive officer. Effective June 29, 2018, our Board appointed Mr. Frederick Jones as President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Director of the Company, and Mr. Nichols resigned from his positions of President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Director, and any other directorships, offices or other positions with the Company.
 
As a shell company, our operating expenses have consisted primarily of, and we expect them to continue to consist primarily of, customary public company expenses, including personnel, accounting, financial reporting, legal, audit and other related public company costs.
 
As of December 31, 2018, as reflected in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet, our current liabilities exceed our total assets. Additionally, we received a report from our independent registered public accountants, relating to our December 31, 2018 audited financial statements, containing an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. We prefer to avoid filing for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. However, unless we are successful in raising additional funds through the offering of debt or equity securities, we may not be able to continue to operate as a going concern for any significant length of time in the future. Notwithstanding the above, we currently intend to continue operating as a public company and make all the requisite filings under the Exchange Act.
 
Delfin Purchase Agreement
 
On December 20, 2017, Michael S. Egan, our former Chief Executive Officer and majority stockholder, and certain of our other stockholders (each a “Seller” and collectively the “Sellers”) entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Delfin. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Delfin agreed to purchase from the Sellers an aggregate of 312,825,952 shares of our Common Stock, representing approximately 70.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of our Common Stock. The closing of the purchase and sale transaction occurred on the Closing Date, as defined above. In connection with the transaction, we terminated the Master Services Agreement we had entered into with an entity controlled by Mr. Egan and satisfied all promissory notes and other borrowings under the credit line with respect to indebtedness owed to related parties. Delfin beneficially owns approximately 70.9% of our Common Stock and continues to beneficially own such amount as of the date of this filing.
 
In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, effective as of the Closing Date, the then sitting members of our Board, Mr. Egan, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mr. Cespedes, President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer and Director, and Ms. Lebowitz, Vice President of Finance and Director, resigned from the Board and their respective officer positions with the Company, and Mr. Nichols was appointed as Chairman of the Board and President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Effective June 29, 2018, our Board appointed Mr. Frederick Jones as President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Director of the Company, and Mr. Nichols resigned from his positions of President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Director, and any other directorships, offices or other positions with the Company.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
As of March 1, 2019, we had no employees. Our executive officer currently devotes very limited time to our business and receives no compensation from us. Our executive officer is an officer, director and/or stockholder of other companies which may have ongoing business relationships with the Company. See the section in this annual report entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our management may have other interests that may conflict with the interests of our stockholders.”
