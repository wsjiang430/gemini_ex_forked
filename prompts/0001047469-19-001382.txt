     ITEM 1.              BUSINESS 
     Overview 
        We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of medicines to treat serious and/or significant unmet medical conditions. Under an exclusive worldwide license agreement with the University of Tennessee Research Foundation, or UTRF, we are developing UTRF's proprietary selective androgen receptor degrader, or SARD, technology, which we believe has the potential to provide compounds that can degrade or antagonize multiple forms of androgen receptor, or AR, thereby potentially inhibiting tumor growth in patients with progressive castration-resistant prostate cancer, or CRPC, including those patients who do not respond to or are resistant to current androgen targeted therapies. We are in the process of completing ongoing mechanistic preclinical studies in order to select the most appropriate SARD compounds to move forward into the additional preclinical studies required to submit an investigational new drug application, or IND, and potentially advance one of our SARD compounds into a first-in-human clinical trial. 
         We had been developing selective androgen receptor modulators, or SARMs. Our SARM product candidate, enobosarm (GTx-024), was most recently evaluated in post-menopausal women with stress urinary incontinence, or SUI. During the third quarter of 2018, we announced that our randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial, or the ASTRID trial, evaluating the change in the mean number of daily SUI episodes following 12 weeks of enobosarm treatment failed to achieve statistical significance on the primary endpoint of the proportion of patients with a greater than 50% reduction in incontinence episodes per day compared to placebo. We have completed the ASTRID trial, including our review of the full data sets from the clinical trial, and have determined that there is not a sufficient path forward to warrant additional clinical development of enobosarm to treat SUI. We have therefore discontinued further development of enobosarm to treat SUI, including discontinuing the related durability and open-label safety extension studies we initiated before we received topline data from the ASTRID trial. We have also discontinued any further development of our SARM program generally. 
         Following the announcement of the ASTRID trial results, our board of directors commenced a process of evaluating strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value. To assist with this process, our board of directors engaged a financial advisory firm to help explore our available strategic alternatives, including possible mergers and business combinations, a sale of part or all of our assets, and collaboration and licensing arrangements. On March 6, 2019, we and Oncternal announced the signing of the Merger Agreement. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions described in the Merger Agreement, including approval of the transaction by our stockholders and Oncternal's stockholders, a wholly-owned subsidiary of GTx will be merged with and into Oncternal, with Oncternal surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of GTx. 
         The proposed Merger is structured as a stock-for-stock transaction whereby all of Oncternal's outstanding shares of common stock and securities convertible into or exercisable for Oncternal's common stock will be converted into the right to receive GTx common stock and securities convertible into or exercisable for GTx common stock. Under the exchange ratio formula in the Merger Agreement, the former Oncternal stockholders immediately before the Merger are expected to own approximately 75% of the outstanding capital stock of GTx, and the stockholders of GTx immediately before the Merger are expected to own approximately 25% of the outstanding capital stock of GTx, subject to certain assumptions. The exchange ratio formula excludes Oncternal's outstanding stock options and warrants and GTx's outstanding stock options and warrants. To the extent Oncternal's outstanding stock options or warrants are exercised in the future, it will result in further dilution to 
 3

   GTx's stockholders. Under certain circumstances as set forth in the Merger Agreement, the ownership percentages may be adjusted upward or downward based on cash levels of the respective companies at the closing of the Merger. We anticipate that the Merger will close in the second quarter of 2019. Following the closing of the Merger, James Breitmeyer will serve as GTx's Chief Executive Officer, Richard Vincent will serve as GTx's Chief Financial Officer, and Lauren Otsuki will serve as GTx's Chief Operating Officer. Additionally, following the closing of the Merger, our board of directors will consist of nine directors, including two current GTx board members. This transaction, which has been approved by our board of directors and the board of directors of Oncternal, is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including the required approvals by the parties' stockholders (including stockholder approval from one of Oncternal's significant stockholders, Shanghai Pharmaceutical (USA) Inc., which holds all of the outstanding shares of one series of Oncternal's preferred stock that must approve the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement) and other customary closing conditions. Certain affiliates of ours who hold approximately 45% of our common stock as of date of the Merger Agreement have agreed to vote in favor of the Merger and certain affiliates of Oncternal, excluding Shanghai Pharmaceutical (USA) Inc., who hold approximately 42% of the outstanding capital stock of Oncternal as of date of the Merger Agreement have agreed to vote in favor of the Merger. However, Oncternal currently expects that it will receive stockholder approval from Shanghai Pharmaceutical (USA) Inc. approximately two months after the date of the Merger Agreement based on the internal approval process required for such approval at Shanghai Pharmaceutical (USA) Inc. 
         In addition, at the effective time of the Merger, GTx and certain other parties will enter into a Contingent Value Rights Agreement, or the CVR Agreement. Pursuant to the CVR Agreement, for each share of GTx common stock held, GTx stockholders of record as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will receive one contingent value right, or CVR, entitling such holders to receive in the aggregate 50% of any net proceeds received during the 15-year period after the closing of the Merger from the grant, sale or transfer of rights to our SARD or SARM technology that occurs during the 10-year period after the closing of the Merger (or in the 11th year if based on a term sheet approved during the initial 10-year period) and, if applicable, to receive royalties on the sale of any SARD products by the combined company during the 15-year period after the closing of the Merger. Under the CVR Agreement, Oncternal (as successor in interest to GTx) agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop SARD products and to divest our SARM technology, subject to certain limitations. The CVRs will not be transferable, except in certain limited circumstances, will not be certificated or evidenced by any instrument and will not be registered with the SEC or listed for trading on any exchange. 
         Although we have entered into the Merger Agreement and intend to consummate the proposed Merger, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully consummate the proposed Merger on a timely basis, or at all. If, for any reason, the proposed Merger is not completed, we will reconsider our strategic alternatives and could pursue one or more of the following courses of action: 
 

 Continue development of our SARD
program.  As set forth above, we are in the process of completing ongoing mechanistic preclinical studies in order to select the most appropriate
SARD compounds to move forward into the additional preclinical studies required to submit an IND and potentially advance one of our SARD compounds into a first-in-human clinical trial. Accordingly,
if, for any reason, the proposed Merger is not consummated, we may determine to move forward with our planned IND-enabling studies of our SARD compounds. However, while we believe that our existing
capital resources will be adequate to enable us to conduct and complete planned IND-enabling preclinical studies of our SARD compounds, we will require significant additional financial resources in
order to initiate and complete initial human clinical trials of a SARD compound and to otherwise further the development of our SARD program.

As
a result, we may also resume our efforts to seek additional funds through potential collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements to provide us with the necessary resources for the
development of our SARD program. 


 Pursue potential collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements for our SARM
assets, including a sale or other divestiture of our SARM assets.  We have discontinued further development of our SARM program, including
enobosarm, and do not currently have any plans to resume development of our SARM program. We continue our efforts to seek potential collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements for our
SARM assets, including a sale or other divestiture of our SARM assets. 
 Pursue another strategic transaction like the proposed
Merger.  Our board of directors may elect to pursue an alternative strategy, one of which may be a strategic transaction similar to the proposed
Merger. 
 Dissolve and liquidate our
assets.  If, for any reason, the proposed Merger is not consummated and we are unable to identify and complete an alternative strategic
transaction like the Merger or potential collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements for our SARM assets, or to continue to operate our business due to our inability to raise additional
funding for the development of our SARD program or otherwise, we may be required to dissolve and liquidate our assets. In such case, we would be required to pay all of our debts and contractual
obligations, and to set aside certain reserves for potential future claims, and there can be no assurances as to the amount or timing of available cash left to distribute to our stockholders after
paying our debts and other obligations and setting aside funds for reserves. 

      Our SARD Program  SARDs for the Potential Treatment of Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
         Scientific Overview.    SARDs are a novel class of drugs. The AR is a major driver of prostate tumor cell proliferation, and blocking its activity is a therapeutic target. Despite the use of therapies designed to inhibit the AR pathway in men with advanced prostate cancer, a significant number of men have tumors that do not respond to such therapeutic approaches and/or become resistant to them. This lack of response may be due to the presence of forms of the AR (splice variants and mutated) for which these therapies are not effective. SARDs are designed to not only bind to androgen receptors, but also induce androgen receptor degradation and ultimately inhibit tumor cell growth. Selective AR degradation which targets the N-terminus may be an effective therapeutic strategy where a variant or mutated AR can be degraded by the SARD. This ability to circumvent common drug resistance in prostate cancer patients may provide an important tool for effective new treatments. 
         We believe SARDs have the potential to treat prostate cancer, as well as other diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and Kennedy's disease. We envision initially developing SARDs as a potentially novel treatment for men with CRPC, including those who do not respond or are resistant to currently approved therapies. Although current therapies have improved overall survival in men with CRPC, approximately one-third of the CRPC patients do not respond to these therapies, due in part to the presence of splice variants, including AR-V7, as well as mutations in the androgen receptor. Splice variants of the androgen receptor have been identified in which the ligand binding domain, the binding site for androgens and necessary for the action of many of the current therapies, is lost. In addition, most patients who initially respond to available treatments eventually progress due to the emergence of resistance to these therapies. It is believed that CRPC growth remains highly dependent on androgen receptor activity, although the mechanisms which underlie this resistance are not fully understood. We 
 5

   believe a therapeutic agent that would safely degrade multiple forms of the androgen receptor, including those without the ligand binding domain, would be uniquely positioned to address this patient population. 
  Potential Market.    In the United States alone, we believe there are approximately 80,000 men who have developed resistance to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, or LHRH, therapies and therefore have CRPC but who have not received chemotherapy. We believe there are approximately 36,000 men diagnosed each year with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer. Zytiga® and XTANDI® are currently the only drugs approved for the treatment of metastatic CRPC in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy, although several other drugs are in clinical development for this indication. We believe new hormonal therapies in development, if approved, will be used prior to chemotherapy as physicians and patients look for treatment options capable of delaying cancer progression and possibly prolonging survival prior to chemotherapy. 
  Preclinical Development.    We are in the process of completing ongoing mechanistic preclinical studies in order to select the most appropriate SARD compounds to move forward into the additional preclinical studies required to submit an IND and potentially advance one of our SARD compounds into a first-in-human clinical trial. However, while we believe that our existing capital resources will be adequate to enable us to conduct and complete planned IND-enabling preclinical studies of our SARD compounds, we will require significant additional financial resources in order to initiate and complete initial human clinical trials of a SARD compound and to otherwise further the development of our SARD program. Accordingly, if, for any reason, the proposed Merger is not consummated, we may resume our efforts to seek additional funds through potential collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements to provide us with the necessary resources for the development of our SARD program. 
      SARMs 
 Evaluation of Enobosarm for the Treatment of Postmenopausal Women with SUI.    In the third quarter of 2017, we initiated the ASTRID trial at over 60 clinical trial centers in the United States to evaluate the change in the mean number of daily SUI episodes following 12 weeks of enobosarm treatment. The ASTRID trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of enobosarm (1 mg and 3 mg) compared with placebo in post-menopausal women who have demonstrated SUI symptoms for more than six months, with an average of 3 to 15 reported SUI episodes per day over a three-day period, and a positive bladder stress test. The primary endpoint for the ASTRID trial was the percentage of patients with at least a 50 percent reduction in mean leaks per day at week 12, compared to baseline. During the third quarter of 2018, we announced that the ASTRID trial failed to achieve statistical significance on the primary endpoint of the proportion of patients with a greater than 50% reduction in incontinence episodes per day compared to placebo. The percentage of patients with a greater than 50% reduction after 12 weeks of enobosarm treatment was 58.9% for 3 mg, 57.7% for 1 mg and 52.7% for placebo. Enobosarm was generally safe and well tolerated, and reported adverse events were minimal and similar across all treatment groups. We have completed the ASTRID trial, including our review of the full data sets from the clinical trial, and have determined that there is not a sufficient path forward to warrant additional clinical development of enobosarm to treat SUI. We have therefore discontinued further development of enobosarm to treat SUI, including discontinuing the related durability and open-label safety extension studies we initiated before we received topline data from the ASTRID trial. 
  Evaluation of Enobosarm for the Treatment of Breast Cancer.    We have previously evaluated enobosarm in a Phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 9 mg and 18 mg dose of enobosarm in patients whose advanced breast cancer is both estrogen receptor, or ER, positive and AR positive. We announced in November 2016 that enobosarm achieved the pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint in the 9 mg dose cohort with 9 patients achieving a clinical benefit response, or CBR, 
 6

   defined as a complete response, partial response, or stable disease, among the first 22 evaluable patients in that cohort. In November 2017, we announced that in the 9 mg cohort, a total of 14 patients achieved a CBR following 24 weeks of treatment. We also announced in November of 2017 that the 18 mg cohort achieved the pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint as 12 patients achieved a CBR at 24 weeks. Although both the 9 mg and 18 mg cohorts met the primary efficacy endpoint in the Phase 2 clinical trial, after evaluating the breast cancer environment where the treatment paradigms are shifting to immunotherapies and/or combination therapies, we decided in the third quarter of 2017 that the time and cost of conducting the necessary clinical trials for potential approval in this indication does not warrant further development of enobosarm in this indication. In 2015, we also commenced enrollment in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an 18 mg dose of enobosarm in patients with advanced AR positive triple-negative breast cancer, or TNBC. This clinical trial was conducted utilizing a Simon's two-stage trial design whereby if at least 2 of the first 21 patients achieved clinical benefit, the trial was designed to enroll the second stage, which would result in enrolling 41 evaluable patients in the clinical trial. During the third quarter of 2017, we completed our review of the data from the first stage of the clinical trial. While our review of the data did not raise any safety concerns, it did confirm that there were insufficient patients achieving clinical benefit from enobosarm treatment to continue this clinical trial and we closed the clinical trial down. 
  Discontinuation of SARM Development Efforts.    Following our review of the full data sets from the ASTRID trial, we discontinued further development of enobosarm to treat SUI and otherwise discontinued any further development of our SARM program. We continue our efforts to seek potential collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements for our SARM assets, including a sale or other divestiture of our SARM assets. If the Merger is completed, any net proceeds derived from the disposition or licensing of our SARM assets following completion of the Merger will be made available to our stockholders in accordance with the CVR Agreement. We have for many years actively pursued, but have been unable to successfully enter into, potential collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements for our SARM assets. If we are unable to ultimately enter into any such arrangements for our SARM assets, we will not receive any return on our investment in enobosarm and our other SARMs. 
      Licenses and Collaborative Relationships 
        We have in the past established and, if the proposed Merger is not completed, we may continue to pursue, in-licenses and partnering, and collaborative or other strategic relationships with academic institutions and with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. 
         In March 2015, we and UTRF entered into a license agreement, or the SARD License Agreement, pursuant to which we were granted exclusive worldwide rights in all existing SARD technologies owned or controlled by UTRF, including all improvements thereto. Under the SARD License Agreement, we are obligated to employ active, diligent efforts to conduct preclinical research and development activities for the SARD program to advance one or more lead compounds into clinical development. We are also obligated to pay UTRF annual license maintenance fees, low single-digit royalties on net sales of products and additional royalties on sublicense revenues, depending on the state of development of a clinical product candidate at the time it is sublicensed. Unless terminated earlier, the term of the SARD License Agreement will continue, on a country-by-country basis, until the expiration of the last valid claim of any licensed patent in the particular country in which a licensed patent is granted. UTRF may terminate the SARD License Agreement for our uncured breach or upon our bankruptcy. 
         In July 2007, we and UTRF also previously entered into a consolidated, amended and restated license agreement, or the SARM License Agreement, to consolidate and replace our two previously 
 7

   existing SARM license agreements with UTRF and to modify and expand certain rights and obligations of each of the parties under both license agreements. Pursuant to the SARM License Agreement, we were granted exclusive worldwide rights in all existing SARM technologies owned or controlled by UTRF, including enobosarm, and certain improvements thereto, and exclusive rights to certain future SARM technology that may be developed by certain scientists at the University of Tennessee or subsequently licensed to UTRF under certain existing inter-institutional agreements with The Ohio State University. Unless terminated earlier, the term of the SARM License Agreement will continue, on a country-by-country basis, for the longer of 20 years or until the expiration of the last valid claim of any licensed patent in the particular country in which a licensed product is being sold. UTRF may terminate the SARM License Agreement for our uncured breach or upon our bankruptcy. 
         Under the SARM License Agreement, we paid UTRF a one-time, upfront fee of $290,000 as consideration for entering into the SARM License Agreement. We are also obligated to pay UTRF annual license maintenance fees, low single-digit royalties on net sales of products and mid-single-digit royalties on sublicense revenues. We also agreed to pay all expenses to file, prosecute and maintain the patents relating to the licensed SARM technologies, and are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize products based on the licensed SARM technologies. While we currently have ceased development efforts for SARMs, we continue to seek potential collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements for our SARM assets, including a sale or other divestiture of our SARM assets. In December 2008, we and UTRF amended the SARM License Agreement, or the SARM License Amendment, to, among other things, clarify the treatment of certain payments that we may receive from our current and future sublicensees for purposes of determining sublicense fees payable to UTRF, including the treatment of payments made to us in exchange for the sale of our securities in connection with sublicensing arrangements. In consideration for the execution of the SARM License Amendment, we paid UTRF $494,000. 
      Manufacturing 
        We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities, and we rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any product candidates. 
         There are no complicated chemistries or unusual equipment required in the manufacturing process for either SARMs or SARDs. We rely and expect to continue to rely on third-party vendors for drug substance and drug product manufacturing, including drug substance for SARDs used in our current and potential future preclinical studies. 
      Competition 
        The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. 
         Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors 
 8

   develop and commercialize similar products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than any products that we and/or our collaborators may develop. 
     SARDs for the Potential Treatment of CRPC 
        We have entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with UTRF to develop its proprietary SARD technology which we believe has the potential to provide compounds that can degrade or antagonize multiple forms of the AR thereby inhibiting tumor growth in patients with CRPC, including those patients who do not respond or are resistant to current therapies. Drugs in development having potentially similar approaches to removing the AR by degradation include Arvinas Inc.'s ARV-110, which is a chimera with an AR binding moiety on one end and an E3 ligase recruiting element on the other that has recently entered Phase 1 development for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer, and Androscience Corporation's androgen receptor degrader enhancer, ASC-J9, which is currently in development for acne and alopecia with the potential for development as a treatment for prostate cancer. Additionally, Essa Pharma Inc. recently completed a Phase 1 study with EPI-506, an AR antagonist that targets the N-terminal domain of the AR, and has plans to develop a second generation agent. C4 Therapeutics, Inc. is developing degronimids as means to degrade the AR through the ligand binding domain associated degradation. CellCentric is developing therapies that target the histone methyltransferase enzyme to lower AR levels, and recently initiated a clinical trial with CCS1477 in prostate cancer. Oric Pharmaceuticals is targeting the glucocorticoid receptor as a means to impact men that have CRPC, and has a lead candidate ORIC-101 in preclinical testing. In addition to this specific potential mechanistic competition, there are various products approved or under clinical development in the broader space of treating men with advanced prostate cancer who have metastatic CRPC which may compete with our proposed initial clinical objective for our SARD compounds. Pfizer and Astellas Pharma market XTANDI® (enzalutamide), an oral androgen receptor antagonist, for the treatment of metastatic CRPC in men previously treated with docetaxel as well as those that have not yet received chemotherapy. XTANDI® received FDA approval in July 2018 for the treatment of men with non-metastatic CRPC. Zytiga®, sold by Johnson & Johnson, has been approved for the treatment of metastatic CRPC and metastatic high-risk castration-sensitive prostate cancer. Johnson & Johnson also received FDA approval for a second generation anti-androgen ERLEADA (apalutamide) for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Bayer HealthCare and Orion Corporation recently announced that the primary endpoint of increased metastatic free survival was met in a Phase 3 study of darolutamide (ODM-201) in men with CRPC without metastases and with a rising PSA. Another target in prostate cancer that is being pursued by several companies is bromodomain inhibition. Zenith Epigenetics, Gilead Sciences Inc., CellCentric, Incyte Corporation and GlaxoSmithKline are among the companies that are evaluating BET inhibitors in Phase 1-2 trials. 
     SARMs 
        With respect to SARMs, there are other SARM product candidates in development that may compete with enobosarm and any future SARM product candidates, if approved for commercial sale. For example, Viking Therapeutic's VK5211 recently reported positive results from a Phase 2 study for patients recovering from non-elective hip fracture surgery. Radius Health Inc.'s RAD140 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 study in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. GlaxoSmithKline is conducting a Phase 1 study to assess the effect of GSK2881078 on physical strength and function after 13 weeks of treatment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, and muscle weakness. OPKO Health's OPK88004 is enrolling in a dose ranging study to improve symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by 
 9

   reducing prostate size and, on the basis of data from a previous trial in 350 men, increase muscle mass and bone strength and decrease body fat. 
      Intellectual Property 
        We will be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents and other proprietary rights are an essential element of our business. 
         For our SARD compounds and methods of use thereof, we have filed certain patent applications in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Japan, China, and other countries in Asia and before the European Patent Office and are the exclusive licensee of worldwide rights for the SARD technology under a license agreement with UTRF executed in 2015. Thus far we have six issued patents and one is allowed, all in the United States. The patents and patent applications (if are issued) will expire between 2036 and 2039. 
         For enobosarm and our other SARM compounds, we have an exclusive license from UTRF under its issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, China and other countries in Asia, before the European Patent Office designating Germany, Great Britain, Spain, France, Italy, and other European Union countries, as well as in certain other countries outside those regions, covering the composition of matter of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for pharmaceutical products, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of synthesizing the active pharmaceutical ingredients. We have also exclusively licensed from UTRF issued and pending patent applications in the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, China and other countries in Asia, before the European Patent Office designating Germany, Great Britain, Spain, France, Italy and other European Union countries, as well as in certain other countries outside those regions, related to methods for treating muscle wasting disorders, including Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, or DMD, and cancer cachexia, and for treating conditions such as SUI and fecal incontinence, as well as sarcopenia, and increasing muscle performance, muscle size and muscle strength and increasing the strength of or mass of a bone and for treating bone related disorders, including bone frailty and osteoporosis. Issued patents for enobosarm composition of matter that we licensed from UTRF and issued in the United States expire in 2024. Issued patents for composition of matter for our other SARM compounds in the United States will expire from 2021-2029, depending on the specific SARM compound. The issued patents outside of the United States for enobosarm expire in 2025, and with respect to other SARM compounds, expire in 2023 and 2027, depending on the specific SARM compound. We have pending patent applications directed to composition of matter and methods of use for our other SARM compounds that, if issued, would expire in the United States and in countries outside the United States in 2027. We have issued patents in the United States, and issued patents and pending applications in countries outside the United States for enobosarm and certain other SARM compounds as a feed composition for animals. The patents in the United States will expire in 2025. Issued patents outside the United States, and patent applications, if issued, which are pending outside the United States, will expire in 2027 or 2031 depending on the country. Patent applications which are pending in the United States and outside the United States using SARMs for SUI and pelvic floor disorders will expire in 2035, if the patents are issued. Our issued patent in the United States using enobosarm for DMD will expire in 2021. Our issued patent in the United States using other SARMs for DMD will expire in 2024. Patent applications, if issued, which are pending in the United States, using other SARMs for DMD will expire in 2024 or 2027 depending on the SARM. 
         We have our own issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States, Canada, Australia, Europe, Japan, China and other countries in Asia, as well as in certain other countries outside those regions, related to solid forms of enobosarm. Issued patents covering solid forms of 
 10

   enobosarm in the United States will expire in 2029. Issued patents and pending patent applications, if issued, in countries outside of the United States will expire in 2028. We have our own pending patent applications and issued patents in the United States and in Europe, Canada, Australia, Japan, China and other countries in Asia related to methods of treating breast cancer using our SARM compounds. Such patents and patent applications, if issued, would expire in 2033 in the United States and outside of the United States. We have issued patents in the United States directed to androgen receptor positive breast cancer in general, various categories of estrogen receptor and androgen receptor positive breast cancer, as well as triple negative breast cancer. 
         We cannot be certain that any of our pending patent applications, or those of UTRF, will result in issued patents. In addition, because the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions, the patents we own and license, or any further patents we may own or license, may not prevent other companies from developing similar or therapeutically equivalent products. Patents also will not protect our product candidates if competitors devise ways of making or using these product candidates without legally infringing our patents. In recent years, several companies have been extremely aggressive in challenging patents covering pharmaceutical products, and the challenges have often been successful. We cannot be assured that our patents will not be challenged by third parties or that we will be successful in any defense we undertake. Failure to successfully defend a patent challenge could materially and adversely affect our business. 
         In addition, changes in patent laws, rules or regulations or in their interpretations in the United States and other countries by the courts may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 
         We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements and our employees to execute assignment of invention agreements to us on commencement of their employment. Agreements with our employees also prevent them from bringing any proprietary rights of third parties to us. We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials. 
      Government Regulation 
    New Drug Development and Approval Process 
        Numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate the testing, clinical development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products and ongoing research and development activities. In the United States, the FDA rigorously reviews pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and applicable regulations. Non-compliance with FDA regulations can result in administrative and judicial sanctions, including warning or untitled letters, clinical holds, fines, recall or seizure of products, injunctions, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to approve marketing applications or allow entry into supply contracts, refusal to permit import or export of products, civil penalties, criminal prosecution and other actions affecting a company and its products. The FDA also has the authority to revoke previously granted marketing authorizations. 
         To secure FDA approval, an applicant must submit extensive preclinical and clinical data, as well as information about product manufacturing processes and facilities and other supporting information 
 11

   to the FDA for each indication to establish a product candidate's safety and efficacy. The development and approval process takes many years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources and may be subject to delays or limitations of approval or rejection of an applicant's new drug application, or NDA. Even if the FDA approves a product, the approval is subject to post-marketing surveillance, adverse drug experience and other recordkeeping and reporting obligations, and may involve ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies. The FDA also has authority to place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications, advertising, promotion or distribution of these products. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
     Preclinical and Clinical Testing 
        Preclinical studies involve laboratory evaluation of product characteristics and animal studies to assess the biological activity and safety of the product. In some cases, long-term preclinical studies are conducted while clinical studies are ongoing. The FDA, under its Good Laboratory Practices regulations, regulates preclinical studies. Violations of these regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the studies, requiring these studies to be replicated. When the preclinical testing is considered adequate by the sponsor to demonstrate the safety and scientific rationale for initial human studies, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND submission. The IND becomes effective, if not rejected by the FDA, within 30 days after the FDA receives the IND. The FDA may, either during the 30-day period after filing of an IND or at any future time, impose a clinical hold on proposed or ongoing clinical trials on various grounds, including that the study subjects are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant health risk. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials cannot commence or recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. 
         Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidates to humans under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices under protocols submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, each clinical trial must be approved and conducted under the auspices of an Investigational Review Board, or IRB, and with patient informed consent. The IRB typically considers, among other things, ethical factors and the safety of human subjects. 
         Clinical trials are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Phase 1 clinical trials usually involve healthy human subjects. The goal of a Phase I clinical trial is to establish initial data about the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties of the product candidates in humans. In Phase 2 clinical trials, controlled studies are conducted on an expanded population of patients with the targeted disease. The primary purpose of these tests is to evaluate the initial effectiveness of the drug candidate on the intended target and to determine if there are any side effects or other risks associated with the drug and to determine the optimal dose of the drug from the safety and efficacy profile developed from the clinical study. Phase 3 trials involve even larger patient populations, often with several hundred or even several thousand patients, depending on the use for which the drug is being studied. Phase 3 trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the drug and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling. During all clinical trials, physicians monitor the patients to determine effectiveness and to observe and report any reactions or other safety risks that may result from use of the drug candidate.

       Product Formulation and Manufacture 
        Concurrent with clinical trials and preclinical studies, companies must develop information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product. In addition, manufacturers, including contract manufacturers, are required to comply with current applicable FDA Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final drugs. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and chemistry stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life. 
         Compliance with cGMP regulations also is a condition of new drug application approval. The FDA must approve manufacturing facilities before they can be used in the commercial manufacture of drug products. In addition, manufacturing establishments are subject to pre-approval inspections and unannounced periodic inspections. 
     New Drug Application Process 
        After the completion of the clinical trial phases of development, if the sponsor concludes that there is substantial evidence that the drug candidate is safe and effective for its intended use, the sponsor may submit a NDA to the FDA. The application must contain all of the information on the drug candidate gathered to that date, including data from the clinical trials, and be accompanied by a user fee. 
         Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, submission of a NDA with clinical data requires payment of a fee, with some exceptions. In return, the FDA assigns a goal of six or ten months from filing of the application to return of a first "complete response," in which the FDA may approve the product or request additional information. There can be no assurance that an application will be approved within the performance goal timeframe established under PDUFA. The FDA initially determines whether a NDA as submitted is acceptable for filing. The FDA may refuse to file an application, in which case the FDA retains one-half of the user fees. If the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the application. As part of this review, the FDA may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a recommendation. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. 
         If the FDA evaluations of the NDA and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA may issue an approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the drug candidate for specified indications. The FDA could also issue a "complete response" letter at the end of the review period. A "complete response" letter will be issued to let a company know that the review period for a drug is complete and that the application is not yet ready for approval. The letter will describe specific deficiencies and, when possible, will outline recommended actions the applicant might take to get the application ready for approval, including calling for additional clinical trial data.

    Marketing Approval and Post-Marketing Obligations 
        If the FDA approves an application, the drug becomes available for physicians to prescribe. Periodic reports must be submitted to the FDA, including descriptions of any adverse reactions reported. The FDA may require post-marketing studies, also known as Phase IV studies, as a condition of approval. In addition to studies required by the FDA after approval, trials and studies are often conducted to explore new indications for the drug. The purpose of these trials and studies and related publications is to develop data to support additional indications for the drug, which must be approved by the FDA, and to increase its acceptance in the medical community. In addition, some post-marketing studies are done at the request of the FDA to develop additional information regarding the safety of a product. 
         The FDA may impose risk evaluation mitigation strategies, or REMS, on a product if the FDA believes there is a reason to monitor the safety of the drug in the marketplace. REMS could add training requirements for healthcare professionals, safety communications efforts, and limits on channels of distribution, among other things. The sponsor would be required to evaluate and monitor the various REMS activities and adjust them if need be. Whether a REMS would be imposed on a product and any resulting financial impact is uncertain at this time. 
         Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, drug sampling and distribution requirements, notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of certain manufacturing or labeling changes, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections for compliance with cGMP requirements. Also, newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product's approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, or even in some instances revocation or withdrawal of the product's approval. 
     Approval Outside of the United States 
        In order to market any product outside of the United States, we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products, which broadly reflect the issues addressed by the FDA above. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Marketing approval in one country does not ensure marketing approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining marketing approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in other countries. 
         As in the United States, the marketing approval process in Europe and in other countries is a lengthy, challenging and inherently uncertain process. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. Generally the development and approval procedures are harmonized throughout the European Union: however, there is limited harmonization in relation to national pricing and reimbursement practices. 
         Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may not market a medicinal product without marketing authorization. There are three procedures for submitting a MAA in the EU: (1) the 
 14

   mutual recognition procedure (MRP); (2) the decentralized procedure (DCP) and (3) the centralized procedure (CP). The submission strategy for a given product will depend on the nature of the product, the target indication(s), the history of the product, and the marketing plan. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products which are produced by biotechnology processes, advanced therapy medicinal products and orphan drugs. Besides the products falling under the mandatory scope, the centralized procedure is also open for other innovative products that are new active substances or other medicinal products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation. 
         The centralized procedure leads to approval of the product in all 27 EU member states and in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Submission of one MAA thus leads to one assessment process and one authorization that allows access to all applicable markets within the entire EU. The process of the centralized procedure is triggered when the applicant sends the letter announcing the intent to submit a MAA (letter of intent). The letter of intent also initiates the assignment of the Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur, who are the two appointed members of the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, representing two EU member states. However, in light of the United Kingdom's vote in 2016 to leave the European Union, the so-called Brexit vote, there may be changes forthcoming in the scope of the centralized approval procedure as the terms of that exit are negotiated between the UK and the European Union. 
         When using the MRP or DCP, the applicant must select which and how many EU member states in which to seek approval. In the case of an MRP, the applicant must initially receive national approval in one EU member state. This will be the so-called reference member state (RMS) for the MRP. Then, the applicant seeks approval for the product in other EU member states, the so-called concerned member states (CMS) in a second step: the mutual recognition process. For the DCP, the applicant will approach all chosen member states at the same time. To do so, the applicant will identify the RMS that will assess the submitted MAA and provide the other selected member states with the conclusions and results of the assessment. 
         When the application for marketing authorization is made, the competent authority responsible for granting a marketing authorization must verify whether the application complies with the relevant requirements, including compliance with the agreed pediatric investigational plan, or PIP. Assuming it does, the marketing authorization may be granted and the relevant results are included in the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for the product, along with a statement indicating compliance with the agreed PIP. It is not necessary for the product actually to be indicated for use in the pediatric population (for example, if the results show that that would not be appropriate). 
     Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 
        Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, a portion of a product's patent term that was lost during clinical development and application review by the FDA may be restored. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides for a statutory protection, known as exclusivity, against the FDA's acceptance or approval of certain competitor applications. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides the legal basis for the approval of abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs. 
         Patent term extension can compensate for time lost during product development and the regulatory review process by returning up to five years of patent life for a patent that covers a new product or its use. This period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a NDA, plus the time between the submission date of a NDA and the approval of that application. Patent term extensions, however, are subject to a maximum extension of five years, and the patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years. 
 15

   The application for patent term extension is subject to approval by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in conjunction with the FDA. It generally takes at least six months to obtain approval of the application for patent term extension. 
         The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides for a period of statutory protection for new drugs that receive NDA approval from the FDA. If a new drug receives NDA approval as a new chemical entity, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active entity, then the Hatch-Waxman Act prohibits an ANDA or a NDA submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all of the data required for approval to be submitted by another company for a generic version of such drug (505(b)(2) NDA), with some exceptions, for a period of five years from the date of approval of the NDA. The statutory protection provided pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act will not prevent the filing or approval of a full NDA, as opposed to an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA, for any drug, including, for example, a drug with the same active ingredient, dosage form, route of administration, strength and conditions of use. In order to obtain a NDA, however, a competitor would be required to conduct its own clinical trials, and any use of the drug for which marketing approval is sought could not violate another NDA holder's patent claims. 
         If NDA approval is received for a new drug containing an active ingredient that was previously approved by the FDA but the NDA is for a drug that includes an innovation over the previously approved drug, for example, a NDA approval for a new indication or formulation of the drug with the same active ingredient, and if such NDA approval was dependent upon the submission to the FDA of new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, then the Hatch-Waxman Act prohibits the FDA from making effective the approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA for a generic version of such drug for a period of three years from the date of the NDA approval. This three year exclusivity, however, only covers the innovation associated with the NDA to which it attaches. Thus, the three year exclusivity does not prohibit the FDA, with limited exceptions, from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the same active ingredient but without the new innovation. 
         While the Hatch-Waxman Act provides certain patent restoration and exclusivity protections to innovator drug manufacturers, it also permits the FDA to approve ANDAs for generic versions of their drugs assuming the approval would not violate another NDA holder's patent claims. The ANDA process permits competitor companies to obtain marketing approval for a drug with the same active ingredient for the same uses but does not require the conduct and submission of clinical studies demonstrating safety and effectiveness for that product. Instead of safety and effectiveness data, an ANDA applicant needs only to submit data demonstrating that its product is bioequivalent to the innovator product as well as relevant chemistry, manufacturing and product data. The Hatch-Waxman Act also instituted a third type of drug application that requires the same information as a NDA, including full reports of clinical and preclinical studies, except that some of the information from the reports required for marketing approval comes from studies which the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference. This type of application, a 505(b)(2) NDA, permits a manufacturer to obtain marketing approval for a drug without needing to conduct or obtain a right of reference for all of the required studies. 
         If a competitor submits an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA for a compound or use of any compound covered by another NDA holder's patent claims, the Hatch-Waxman Act requires, in some circumstances, the applicant to notify the patent owner and the holder of the approved NDA of the factual and legal basis of the applicant's opinion that the patent is not valid or will not be infringed. Upon receipt of this notice, the patent owner and the NDA holder have 45 days to bring a patent infringement suit in federal district court and obtain a 30-month stay against the company seeking to reference the NDA. The NDA holder could still file a patent suit after the 45 days, but if they miss the 
 16

   45-day deadline, they would not have the benefit of the 30-month stay. Alternatively, after this 45-day period, the applicant may file a declaratory judgment action, seeking a determination that the patent is invalid or will not be infringed. Depending on the circumstances, however, the applicant may not be able to demonstrate a controversy sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the court. The discovery, trial and appeals process in such suits can take several years. If such a suit is commenced, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides a 30-month stay on the approval of the competitor's ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. If the litigation is resolved in favor of the competitor or the challenged patent expires during the 30-month period, unless otherwise extended by court order, the stay is lifted and the FDA may approve the application. Under regulations issued by the FDA, and essentially codified under the Medicare prescription drug legislation, the patent owner and the NDA holder have the opportunity to trigger only a single 30-month stay per ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. Once the applicant of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA has notified the patent owner and the NDA holder of the infringement, the applicant cannot be subjected to another 30-month stay, even if the applicant becomes aware of additional patents that may be infringed by its product. 
     Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement 
        We currently have no marketed products. In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities or programs, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Third-party payors may also control access to, or manage utilization of, our products with various utilization management techniques, such as requiring prior authorization for coverage of our products. 
         Within the United States, if we obtain appropriate approval in the future to market any of our oral drug product candidates, those products could potentially be covered by various government health benefit programs as well as purchased by government agencies. The participation in such programs or the sale of products to such agencies is subject to regulation. The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. 
         Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, participating manufacturers are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law and may be subject to an additional discount if certain pricing increases more than inflation. 
         Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Oral drugs may be covered under Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that do not need to be injected or otherwise administered by a physician). Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time-to-time. The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with manufacturers and may condition formulary placement on the availability of 
 17

   manufacturer discounts. Since 2011, manufacturers with marketed brand name drugs have been required to provide a 50% discount the negotiated price for on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reach the coverage gap in their drug benefits, and, beginning in 2019, that discount increased to 70%. 
         Drug products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS). FSS participation is required for a drug product to be covered and reimbursed by certain federal agencies and for coverage under Medicaid, Medicare Part B and the Public Health Service (PHS) pharmaceutical pricing program. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that a manufacturer charges its most-favored non-federal customer for its product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing (known as the "federal ceiling price") and may be subject to an additional discount if pricing increases more than the rate of inflation. 
         To maintain coverage of drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, manufacturers are required to extend discounts to certain purchasers under the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS. 
         The United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, health care, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act ("Healthcare Reform Act") which includes changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government health care programs. Under the Trump administration, there have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminates the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019 (the so-called "individual mandate"). In a May 2018 report, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that, compared to 2018, the number of uninsured will increase by 3 million in 2019 and 6 million in 2028, in part due to the elimination of the individual mandate. The Healthcare Reform Act has also been subject to judicial challenge. In December 2018, a federal district court judge, in a challenge brought by a number of state attorneys general, found the Healthcare Reform Act unconstitutional in its entirety because, once Congress repealed the individual mandate provision, there was no longer a basis to rely on Congressional taxing authority to support enactment of the law. Pending appeals, which could take some time, the Healthcare Reform Act is still operational in all respects. 
         There have also been other reform initiatives under the Trump Administration, including initiatives focused on drug pricing. For example, in May of 2018, President Trump and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services released a "blueprint" to lower prescription drug prices and out-of-pocket costs. Certain proposals in the blueprint, and related drug pricing measures proposed since the blueprint, could cause significant operational and reimbursement changes for the pharmaceutical industry. As another example, in November of 2018, CMS issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking that proposed revisions to Medicare Part D to support health plans' negotiation of lower drug prices with manufacturers and reduce health plan members' out-of-pocket costs. The HHS Office of Inspector General also issued a proposed rule in February of 2019 that would revise the federal anti-kickback statute to limit protection for discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers ("PBMs"), Medicare Part D plans, and Medicaid managed care plans 
 18

   that are not reflected in the price charged to the patient at the pharmacy counter and to provide protection only for certain types of service fees paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers to PBMs. 
         Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny in the U.S. of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There have also been several recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices or price increases. Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our product candidates if approved for sale. 
         We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the Healthcare Reform Act or other federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results. 
         Although we currently have no products approved for commercial sale, we marketed FARESTON® through September 30, 2012 and the product was covered under various government health benefit programs as well as purchased by federal agencies. We could be subject to liability under federal laws regulating our participation in such programs or the sale of our product to such agencies if we failed to comply with applicable requirements, including reporting prices for our products or offering products for sale at certain prices. 
     Regulations Pertaining to Sales and Marketing 
        Although we currently have no products approved for commercial sale, we may be subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care "fraud and abuse," including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws for activities related to our previous sales of FARESTON®, which we sold to a third party in 2012, or to future sales of any of our product candidates that may in the future receive regulatory and marketing approval. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a prescription drug manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under such anti-kickback laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for reimbursed drugs or services to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). 
         Laws and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers with marketed products. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers and/or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our prior activities (when we marketed FARESTON®) or any future activities (if we obtain approval and/or reimbursement from federal healthcare programs for our product candidates) could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent laws and regulations.
