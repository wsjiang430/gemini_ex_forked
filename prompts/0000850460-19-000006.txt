Item 1. Business.
General
Encore Wire Corporation is a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 1989, with its principal executive office and manufacturing plants located at 1329 Millwood Road, McKinney, Texas 75069. The Company’s telephone number is (972) 562-9473. As used in this annual report, unless otherwise required by the context, the terms “we,” “our,” “Company,” “Encore” and “Encore Wire” refer to Encore Wire Corporation.
Encore believes it is a low-cost manufacturer of electrical building wire and cable. The Company is a significant supplier of building wire for interior electrical wiring in commercial and industrial buildings, homes, apartments, and manufactured housing.
The principal customers for Encore’s wire are wholesale electrical distributors, who sell building wire and a variety of other products to electrical contractors. The Company sells its products primarily through independent manufacturers’ representatives located throughout the United States and, to a lesser extent, through its own direct in-house marketing efforts.
Strategy
Encore’s strategy is to further expand its share of the building wire market primarily by emphasizing a high level of customer service and the addition of new products that complement its current product line, while maintaining and enhancing its low-cost production capabilities. Encore’s low-cost production capability features an efficient plant design incorporating highly automated manufacturing equipment, an integrated production process and a highly-motivated work force. Encore's plants are all located on one large campus. This single-site campus enables and enhances low-cost manufacturing, distribution and administration, as well as helping to build and maintain a cohesive company culture.
Customer Service: Encore is highly focused on responding to customer needs, with an emphasis on building and maintaining strong customer relationships. Encore seeks to establish customer loyalty by achieving a high order fill rate and rapidly handling customer orders, shipments, inquiries and returns. The Company maintains product inventories sufficient to meet anticipated customer demand and believes that the speed and completeness with which it fills orders are key competitive advantages critical to marketing its products.
Product Innovation: Encore has been a leader in bringing new ideas to a commodity product. Encore pioneered the widespread use of color feeder sizes of commercial wire and colors in residential non-metallic cable. The colors have improved on-the-job safety, reduced installation times for contractors and enabled building inspectors to rapidly and accurately inspect construction projects. Encore Wire’s patented SmartColor ID® system for metal-clad and armor-clad cables allows for quick and accurate identification of gauge, number of conductors, wire and jacket type. Additionally, Encore currently has multiple patents and patent-pending innovations that range from process improvements to packaging solutions.
Low-Cost Production: Encore’s low-cost production capability features an efficient plant design and an incentivized work force.
Efficient Plant Design: Encore’s highly automated wire manufacturing equipment is integrated in an efficient design that reduces material handling, labor and in-process inventory.
Incentivized Work Force: The Company has a stock option plan and a stock appreciation rights plan that enhance the motivation of its salaried manufacturing supervisors. The Company also has a comprehensive safety program that emphasizes employee participation. The Company provides a 401(k) retirement savings plan to all employees.
Products
Encore offers an electrical building wire product line that consists primarily of NM-B cable, UF-B cable, THHN/THWN-2, XHHW-2, RHH/RHW-2 and other types of wire products, including tray cable, metal-clad and armored cable. All of these products are manufactured with copper or aluminum as the current-carrying component of the conductor. The principal bases for differentiation among stock-keeping units (“SKUs”) are product type, conductor type, diameter, insulation, length, color and packaging.
Manufacturing
The efficiency of Encore’s highly automated manufacturing facility is a key element of its low-cost production capability. Encore’s wire manufacturing lines have been integrated so that the handling of product is substantially reduced throughout the production process. The manufacturing process for the Company’s various products involves multiple steps, including: casting, drawing, stranding, compounding, insulating, cabling, jacketing and armoring.

Encore manufactures and tests all of its products in accordance with the Underwriters Laboratories (UL) standards, a nationally recognized testing and standards agency. Additionally, UL representatives routinely visit and test products from each area of manufacturing. 
Customers
Encore sells its wire to wholesale electrical distributors throughout the United States. Most distributors supply products to electrical contractors. Encore’s customers are numerous and diversified. Encore has three customers, each of whom slightly exceeds 10% of the Company's total sales. Encore has no customer, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Encore believes that the speed and completeness with which it fills customers’ orders is crucial to its ability to expand the market share for its products. The Company also believes that, for a variety of reasons, many customers strive to maintain lean inventories. Because of this trend, the Company seeks to maintain sufficient inventories to satisfy customers’ prompt delivery requirements.
Marketing and Distribution
Encore markets its products throughout the United States primarily through independent manufacturers’ representatives and, to a lesser extent, through its own direct marketing efforts.
Encore maintains the majority of its finished product inventory at its plant in McKinney, Texas. In order to provide flexibility in handling customer requests for immediate delivery, additional product inventories are maintained at warehouses owned and operated by some of the Company's independent manufacturers’ representatives located strategically across the country. 
Finished goods are typically delivered to customers by trucks operated by common carriers. The decision regarding the carrier to be used is based primarily on availability and cost.
The Company invoices its customers directly for products purchased and, if an order has been obtained through a manufacturer’s representative, pays the representative a commission based on pre-established rates. The Company determines customer credit limits. The Company recorded no bad debt charges in 2018, 2017, and 2016. The manufacturers’ representatives have no discretion to determine prices charged for the Company’s products, and all sales are subject to Company approval. 
Employees
Encore believes that its hourly employees are highly motivated and that their motivation contributes significantly to Encore’s efficient operation. The Company believes that competitive hourly compensation coupled with sound management practices focuses its employees on maintaining high production standards and product quality.
As of December 31, 2018, Encore had 1,278 employees, 1,061 of whom were paid hourly wages and were primarily engaged in the operation and maintenance of the Company’s manufacturing and warehouse facilities. The Company’s remaining employees were executive, supervisory, administrative, sales and clerical personnel. The Company considers its relations with its employees to be generally positive. The Company has no collective bargaining agreements with any of its employees.
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used by Encore in manufacturing its products are copper cathode, copper scrap, PVC thermoplastic compounds, XLPE compounds, aluminum, steel, paper and nylon, all of which are readily available from a number of suppliers. Copper is the principal raw material used by the Company in manufacturing its products, constituting 83.5% of the dollar value of all raw materials used by the Company during 2018. Copper requirements are purchased primarily from miners and commodity brokers at prices determined each month primarily based on the average daily COMEX closing prices for copper for that month, plus a negotiated premium. The Company also purchases raw materials necessary to manufacture various PVC thermoplastic compounds. These raw materials include PVC resin, clay and plasticizer.
The Company produces copper rod from purchased copper cathode and copper scrap in its own rod fabrication facility. The Company reprocesses copper scrap generated by its operations as well as copper scrap purchased from others. In 2018, the Company’s copper rod fabrication facility manufactured virtually all of the Company’s copper rod requirements. The Company purchases aluminum rod from various suppliers for aluminum wire production.
The Company also compounds its own wire jacket and insulation compounds. The process involves the mixture of PVC raw material components to produce the PVC used to insulate the Company’s wire and cable products. The raw materials include PVC resin, clay and plasticizer. During the last year, the Company’s plastic compounding facility produced the vast majority of the Company’s PVC requirements.

Competition
The electrical wire and cable industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with several companies who manufacture and sell wire and cable products beyond the building wire segment in which the Company competes. The Company’s primary competitors include Southwire Company, Cerro Wire LLC, General Cable (a company of the Prysmian Group) and AFC Cable Systems, Inc.
For our copper products, the Company believes that it is competitive with respect to all relevant factors, including order fill rate, quality, pricing, and, in some instances, breadth of product line. 
For aluminum products, which represented 7.3% of net sales in 2018, the Company has encountered significant price-based import competition from aluminum wire imports from China, which are sold through U.S. based distributors. In September 2018, the Company joined with another U.S. producer in filing petitions with the U.S. Commerce Department and International Trade Commission (ITC), requesting that they investigate whether aluminum wire and cable imports into the United States are being illegally dumped and subsidized. The Commerce Department initiated these investigations in October 2018, and the ITC issued preliminary affirmative determinations in November 2018. These investigations are still pending and final results are not expected before the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Compliance with Environmental Regulations
The Company is subject to federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations governing the Company’s operations and the use, handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances currently or formerly used by the Company. Management believes the Company is in compliance with all such rules including permitting and reporting requirements. Historically, compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material impact on the capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company. 
Environmental, Social and Governance
Encore Wire is very committed to the philosophy supporting good stewardship of the environment, focusing on being good corporate citizens, and practicing good corporate governance. The Company has been committed to robust environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices since long before the term “ESG” became commonly used with respect to corporate governance. Encore Wire puts these principles at the forefront of its company culture. Below are some key highlights of ESG efforts that we have exhibited:

• | We believe we are a leading scrap recycler in our industry. We have a system to reclaim copper scrap that converts both internal and external scrap copper wire back into usable copper rod. This operation consumes tens of millions of pounds of scrap copper per year. Our process utilizes multiple steps to recover the greatest amount of copper possible. 


• | We recycle plastic and metals used in our operations as much as possible throughout our manufacturing process.


• | We are committed to exploring numerous options to recycle any residual copper and plastic to third party recyclers to avoid taking scrap to landfills.


• | We make an effort to recycle all materials used on site, including pallets, cardboard and other materials.


• | We voluntarily installed major air pollution control equipment, water treatment/recycle systems, wastewater minimization units, and storm water/spill control structures which are not required by regulation.


• | Our wastewater monitoring program far exceeds the monitoring required by our wastewater permit, and we have been recognized by the City of McKinney for our commitment to the wastewater pretreatment program.


• | We installed new cutting-edge equipment on our campus to reduce natural gas, electricity and water usage. We did this to be as environmentally friendly as possible and to aid in cost savings. This is in keeping with one of our core corporate mottos: “Do the Right Thing”. 


• | Our Research and Development building was built to “LEED Platinum” standards and has been recognized for its low environmental impact.


• | We have won civic recognition for our charitable giving in the local communities where our employees live. We give to numerous causes with a particular focus on organizations that serve children and women, including people who are going through tough times as well as youth sports and churches. 


• | Members of our management team have served on numerous boards of civic and charitable organizations.


• | Our Board is focused on and committed to making sure the Company is managed in an ethical fashion.


• | The Company has been managed to grow and enhance shareholder value, while being cognizant of industry cyclicality and avoiding excess leverage to the balance sheet.

We have maintained a focus on these and many other areas of corporate responsibility throughout our history, with minimal publicity. “Doing the Right Thing” is much more than a slogan and will continue to be a key focus throughout the Company, including in areas such as our increasing commitment to Board diversity.
