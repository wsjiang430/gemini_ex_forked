ITEM 1. Business
Overview
Nutanix, Inc. ("we," "us," "our" or "Nutanix") provides a leading enterprise cloud platform that consists of software solutions that power many of the world’s business applications by digitizing the traditional silos of enterprise computing. Founded in 2009, we pioneered hyperconverged infrastructure ("HCI"), initially combining the disparate IT silos of compute, storage and networking into a single on-premises product. As the market realized the power, scalability and customer choice that HCI provides, we continued to innovate, and Acropolis Hypervisor ("AHV") - our hypervisor that provides free virtualization designed to run all virtualized applications - was born. To give our customers even more choice, we engineered our software solutions to run on a variety of underlying hardware platforms, decoupling our software from our Nutanix-branded hardware appliances and creating a true enterprise cloud operating system that can power a variety of on-premises private cloud deployments; a significant step in our transition from a hardware to a software company. That transition has continued with the adoption of "cloud" as a mainstream IT paradigm, which has caused enterprises to move toward hybrid cloud architectures that allow businesses to simultaneously utilize a private cloud powered by Nutanix software, leverage third-party public cloud solutions where applicable, and distribute their IT architecture to the edge where their businesses increasingly engage with devices and users. We continue to transform our software solutions into a comprehensive enterprise cloud platform, based on web-scale engineering and operational simplicity, which allows our customers to take advantage of the paradigm shift by providing simple-to-use and integrated solutions that can power nearly any scale IT deployment, while giving customers the freedom of choice to connect their Nutanix powered on-premises deployments with, and to run applications across, various cloud environments, utilizing various hardware platforms and taking advantage of various virtualization solutions. Today, our enterprise cloud platform natively converges compute, virtualization, storage, networking, desktop and security services into one integrated, simple-to-consume solution. Further, although our customers primarily use our enterprise cloud platform to power their on-premises private cloud deployments, our solutions also allow enterprises to simplify the complexities of a multi-cloud environment with automation, cost governance and compliance. The end result will be an enterprise cloud platform that empowers our customers to unify various clouds - on-premises private, public and distributed - into one seamless cloud, allowing enterprises to choose the right cloud for each application.
In addition to our transition to a software-centric business model, and in order to further capitalize on the hybrid cloud paradigm shift and provide our customers with additional freedom to choose the best way to consume our enterprise cloud platform based on their specific business needs, we are also reshaping our licensing models in order to better meet changing customer demands by moving toward a subscription-based business model over the long term. A subscription-based business model means one in which our products, including associated support and entitlement arrangements, are sold with a defined term. For more information, see the section titled "Components of Our Results of Operations" included in Part II, Item 7, as well as Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. That transition will result in our traditional life-of-device licensing models being increasingly replaced by term-based licenses, providing our customers with a subscription consumption option that matches the way they consume third-party public cloud services, and will provide true license portability across hybrid cloud deployments. We believe that these transitions - from hardware to software solutions, and from life-of-device to subscription models - will contribute to our long-term growth, although they may have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance in the near term. In fiscal 2019, our subscription billings increased to 60.5% of total billings, up 19 percentage points from fiscal 2018, and our subscription revenue reached $648.4 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 96.1%.
Our Enterprise Cloud Platform
Our enterprise cloud platform, which includes the software features, products and services described below, allows our customers to meld their on-premises private clouds with both third-party public clouds and distributed cloud operating infrastructures and uses powerful distributed systems architecture that natively converges compute, virtualization, storage, networking, desktop and security services into a single, integrated, simple-to-consume solution for our customers at each key stage of their enterprise cloud journey. 
Our product portfolio is designed to track our customers’ journey to a full enterprise cloud, providing a turnkey solution at each key stage of the customer journey. Nutanix Core, which includes our foundational HCI products, is 
the first leg of the customer journey and seeks to bring simplicity and operational efficiency by facilitating the customer’s initial migration from the traditional siloed infrastructure to a simpler on-premises HCI platform. We expect sales of Nutanix Core solutions to continue to make up a majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Nutanix Essentials, which provides capabilities for our customers who want to build on our Core offerings and enhance security, automation, storage management and operational efficiencies, is the next step in the customer journey. Finally, Nutanix Enterprise provides a suite of offerings to accompany our customers as they advance into the hybrid and multi-cloud deployment stage of their enterprise cloud transition journey.
Nutanix Core
Our customers begin their enterprise cloud journey-modernizing their IT infrastructures and migrating from traditional infrastructure to a simpler and integrated on-premises enterprise cloud platform-with Nutanix Core. Nutanix Core is comprised of our HCI products, which form the foundation of our enterprise cloud platform: Acropolis ("AOS"), our software-defined HCI product; Prism, our HCI control plane and management console; and AHV, our hypervisor that provides free virtualization.

Delivery of Our Solutions
Our enterprise cloud platform can be deployed on-premises running on a variety of qualified hardware platforms or, in the case of our cloud-based software and software-as-a-service ("SaaS") offerings, via hosted service. Non-portable software licenses for our platform are delivered or sold alongside configured-to-order appliances, with a license term equal to the life of the associated appliance. Our subscription term-based licenses are sold separately, or can also be sold alongside configured-to-order appliances. Our subscription term-based licenses typically have a term of one to five years. Our cloud-based SaaS subscriptions have terms extending up to five years. As we continue our transition toward a subscription-based business model, we expect a greater portion of our products to be delivered through subscription term-based licenses or cloud-based SaaS subscriptions.
Configured-to-order appliances, including our Nutanix-branded NX hardware line, can be purchased from one of our channel partners, original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), or directly from Nutanix. Super Micro Computer, Inc. ("Super Micro") and Flextronics Systems Limited ("Flextronics") pre-install our software on our Nutanix-branded NX series appliances. Dell Technologies ("Dell"), Lenovo Group Ltd. ("Lenovo"), International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), Fujitsu Technology Solutions GmbH ("Fujitsu"), Hewlett Packard Enterprise ("HPE") and Inspur Group ("Inspur") pre-install our software on their hardware to create the Dell XC Series, Lenovo Converged HX Series, IBM CS Series, Fujitsu XF Series, HPE DX Series and Inspur inMerge 1000 Series appliances, respectively. Some of our OEM partners also sell associated support offerings.
Our enterprise cloud platform is typically purchased with one or more years of support and entitlements, which includes the right to software upgrades and enhancements as well as technical support. Purchases of non-portable software typically come with an accompanying support and entitlement agreement with a term that matches the software license term. Purchases of term-based licenses and SaaS subscriptions have support and entitlements built into the license.
Our Support Programs
Product Support. We offer varying levels of product support to our customers based on their needs. We also offer premium support programs through our technical account managers and designated support engineers.
Professional Services. We provide consulting and implementation services to customers through our professional services team for assessment, design, deployment and optimizing of their Nutanix environments. We typically provide these services at the time of initial installation to help the customer with configuration and implementation.
Our End Customers
Our solutions serve a broad range of workloads, including enterprise applications, databases, virtual desktop infrastructure, unified communications and big data analytics, and we support both virtualized and container-based applications. We have end customers across a broad range of industries, such as automotive, consumer goods, education, energy, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, media, public sector, retail, technology and telecommunications. We also sell to service providers, who utilize our enterprise cloud platform to provide a variety of cloud-based services to their customers. We had a broad and diverse base of approximately 14,180 end customers as of July 31, 2019, including approximately 810 Global 2000 enterprises. We define the number of end customers as the number of end customers for which we have received an order by the last day of the period, excluding partners to which we have sold products for their own demonstration purposes. A single organization or customer may represent multiple end customers for separate divisions, segments or subsidiaries. The number of end customers grew from approximately 10,610 as of July 31, 2018 to approximately 14,180 as of July 31, 2019.
Our enterprise cloud platform is primarily sold through channel partners, including distributors, resellers and OEMs, and delivered directly to our end customers. Arrow Electronics, Inc., a distributor to our end customers, represented 
16%, 18% and 24% of our total revenue for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Tech Data Corporation, another distributor to our end customers, represented 14%, 13% and 13% of our total revenue for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
Growth Strategy
Key elements of our growth strategy include:

• | Continually innovate and maintain technology leadership. Since inception, we have rapidly innovated from supporting limited applications and a single hypervisor to a full enterprise cloud platform that is designed to support a wide variety of workloads across private, public and multi-cloud deployments. We intend to continue to invest heavily in developing our enterprise cloud platform with new features, services and products to expand our market opportunity.


• | Invest to acquire new end customers. We completed our first end customer sale in October 2011 and have since grown to approximately 14,180 end customers. We intend to grow our base of end customers by continuing to invest in sales and marketing, leveraging our network of channel partners and OEMs, furthering our international expansion and extending our enterprise cloud platform to address new customer segments. One area of continued focus increasing our sales to new, and expanding our sales to existing, large enterprise customers.


• | Continue to drive follow-on sales to existing end customers. Our end customers typically deploy our technology initially for a specific workload. Our sales teams and channel partners then seek to systematically target follow-on sales opportunities to drive additional purchases throughout our broader product portfolio. This land and expand strategy enables us to quickly expand our footprint within our existing end customer base from follow-on orders that in the aggregate are often multiples of the initial order.


• | Deepen engagement with current channel and OEM partners and establish additional routes to market to enhance sales leverage. We have established meaningful channel partnerships globally and have driven strong engagement and commercial success with several major resellers and distributors. We believe that our OEM relationships can augment our routes to market to accelerate our growth and that there is a significant opportunity to grow our sales with our channel partners and OEMs. We intend to attract and engage new channel and OEM partners around the globe while also selling our standalone software for deployment on qualified hardware or a hosted service to maximize the availability of our solutions for our customers.


• | Invest in rapid growth while remaining focused on our overall financial health. We intend to continue investing in our rapid growth, while balancing such growth against our operating expenses. By maintaining this balance, we believe we can drive toward our high growth potential without sacrificing our overall financial health.

Sales and Marketing
Sales. We primarily engage our end customers through our global sales force who directly interact with key IT decision makers while also providing sales development, opportunity qualification and support to our channel partners. We have established relationships with our channel partners, who represent many of the key resellers and distributors of datacenter infrastructure software and systems in each of the geographic regions where we operate. We also engage our end customers through our OEM partners, which license our software and package it with their hardware, and sell through their direct sales forces and channel partners.
Technology Alliances. We have developed relationships with a number of leading technology companies that help us deliver world-class solutions to our customers. Through our Elevate Technology Alliance Partner Program, our developer, application, hardware and infrastructure partners get access to resources that allow them to validate and integrate their products with Nutanix solutions and engage in joint sales training and enablement. In addition, we work closely with our technology partners through co-marketing and lead-generation activities in an effort to broaden our marketing reach and help us win new customers and retain existing ones.
Marketing. Our channel partners have joined our integrated partner program, the Nutanix Partner Network, which provides market development funds, preferred pricing through deal registration, sales enablement and product training, innovative marketing campaigns and dedicated account support. We also coordinate with our OEM partners on joint marketing activities. We supplement our sales efforts with our marketing programs that include print and 
online advertising, corporate and third-party events, demand generation activities, social media promotions, media and analyst relations and community programs. For example, in May 2019 we hosted our fifth annual .NEXT Conference, where nearly 6,000 attendees came to learn about our current and future products and solutions. We also establish deep integration with our ecosystem of third-party technology partners and engage in joint marketing activities with them.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts are focused primarily on improving current technology, developing new technologies in current and adjacent markets and supporting existing end customer deployments. Our research and development teams primarily consist of distributed systems software and user interface engineers. A large portion of our research and development team is based in San Jose, California. We also maintain research and development centers in India, North Carolina, Washington, Serbia and Germany. We plan to dedicate significant resources to our continued research and development efforts, and intend to continue to grow our global research and development and engineering teams to enhance our solutions, improve integration with new and existing ecosystem partners and broaden the range of IT infrastructure technologies that we converge into our enterprise cloud platform. We believe that these investments will contribute to our long-term growth, although they may adversely affect our profitability in the near term.
Research and development expense was $288.6 million, $313.8 million and $500.7 million for fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. 
Manufacturing
We do not manufacture any hardware. The Nutanix-branded NX series appliances, including those that are delivered by us, are manufactured for us based on our specifications by two manufacturers, Super Micro and Flextronics. Super Micro and Flextronics assemble and test the Nutanix-branded NX series appliances and they generally procure the components used in the NX series appliances directly from third-party suppliers. Our agreement with Super Micro automatically renews in May 2020 for successive one-year periods thereafter, with the option to terminate upon each annual renewal. Our agreement with Flextronics expires in November 2020 and automatically renews for successive one-year periods thereafter, with the option to terminate upon each annual renewal. Distributors handle fulfillment and shipment for certain end customers, but do not hold inventory.
Backlog
We typically accept and ship orders within a short time frame. In general, customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty prior to delivery, and delivery schedules requested by customers in their purchase orders vary based upon each customer’s particular needs. As a result, we do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is a reliable indicator of future revenue.
Competition
We operate in the intensely competitive enterprise infrastructure market and compete primarily with companies that sell software to build and operate enterprise clouds, integrated systems and standalone storage and servers, as well as providers of public cloud infrastructure solutions. These markets are characterized by constant change and rapid innovation. Our main competitors fall into the following categories:

• | software providers, such as VMware, Inc. ("VMware"), that offer a broad range of virtualization, infrastructure and management products to build and operate enterprise and hybrid clouds;


• | traditional IT systems vendors, such as Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco"), Dell, HPE, Hitachi Data Systems ("Hitachi"), IBM and Lenovo, that offer integrated systems that include bundles of servers, storage and networking solutions, as well as a broad range of standalone server and storage products;


• | traditional storage array vendors, such as Dell, Hitachi and NetApp, Inc. ("NetApp"), which typically sell centralized storage products; and


• | providers of public cloud infrastructure and SaaS-based offerings, such as Amazon.com, Inc. ("Amazon"), Google Inc. and Microsoft Corporation.

In addition, we compete against vendors of hyperconverged infrastructure and software-defined storage products, such as Cisco, HPE, Dell, VMware and many smaller emerging companies. As our market grows, we 
expect it will continue to attract new companies as well as existing larger vendors. Some of our competitors may also expand their product offerings, acquire competing businesses, sell at lower prices, bundle with other products, provide closed technology platforms, partner with other companies to develop joint solutions, or otherwise attempt to gain a competitive advantage. Furthermore, as we expand our product offerings, we may expand into new markets and we may encounter additional competitors in such markets. Additionally, as companies increasingly offer competing solutions, they may be less willing to cooperate with us as an OEM or otherwise. For example, IBM recently acquired Red Hat, Inc. ("Red Hat") and they may begin to prioritize selling Red Hat products instead of our products in its global consulting business. In addition, Dell owns a majority of the outstanding voting power of VMware, and a joint Dell and VMware offering would also compete directly with our core solutions. Dell may also be incentivized to sell its own solutions over our products.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:

• | product features and capabilities;


• | system scalability, performance and resiliency;


• | management and operations, including provisioning, analytics, automation and upgrades;


• | total cost of ownership over the lifetime of the technology;


• | product interoperability with third-party applications, infrastructure software, infrastructure systems and platforms and public clouds;


• | application mobility across disparate silos of enterprise computing, including public and private cloud infrastructure; and


• | complete customer experience, including usability, support and professional services.

We believe we are positioned favorably against our competitors based on these factors. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, broader distribution and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect and use our core technology and intellectual property. We rely on patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and employee nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. As of July 31, 2019, we had 102 United States patents that have been issued and 326 non-provisional patent applications pending in the United States. Our issued U.S. patents expire between 2031 and 2037. We also leverage open source software in some of our products.
See Item 1A, "Risk Factors," for further discussion of risks related to protecting our intellectual property.
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters are located in San Jose, California where, under lease agreements that expire through May 2024, we currently lease approximately 400,000 square feet of space. We also maintain offices in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. We lease all of our facilities and do not own any real property. We expect to add facilities as we grow our employee base and expand geographically. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future and that, should it be needed, suitable additional space will be available to accommodate the expansion of our operations.
Employees
We had approximately 5,340 employees worldwide as of July 31, 2019. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor organization or is a party to any collective bargaining arrangement. In certain of the European countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements in relation to the establishment of works councils. We are often required to consult and seek the consent or advice of these works councils. We have never had a work stoppage and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
