Understanding Our Approach – The AgriFORCE™ Precision Growth Method
 
Traditional farming includes three fundamental approaches: outdoor, greenhouse and indoor. AgriFORCE™ introduces a unique fourth method, the AgriFORCE™ precision growth method, which is informed by cutting-edge science and leveraging the latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT).

-

 

With a carefully optimized approach to facility design, IoT, AI utilization, nutrient delivery, and micro-propagation, we have devised an intricate, scientific and high success-oriented approach designed to produce much greater efficacy yields using fewer resources. This method is intended to outperform traditional growing methods using a specific combination of new and traditional techniques required to attain this efficiency. We call it precision growth. The AgriFORCE™ precision growth method focuses on addressing some of the most important legacy challenges in agriculture: environmental impact, operational efficiency and yield volumes.
 
The AgriFORCE™ precision growth method presents a tremendous opportunity to positively disrupt all corners of the industry. The market size of just the nutraceutical and plant-based pharmaceutical and vaccine/therapeutics market is over $500 billion. Including the traditional hydroponics high value crops and controlled-environment food markets, the addressable market approaches nearly $1 trillion. (1)(2)(3).
 
The AgriFORCE™ Model – Managing the Difficulties of Agricultural Verticals with Modern Technology and Innovation
 
Our intellectual property combines a uniquely engineered facility design and automated growing system to provide a clear solution to the biggest problems plaguing most high value crop agricultural verticals. It delivers a clean, self-contained environment that maximizes natural sunlight and offers near ideal supplemental lighting. It also limits human intervention and – crucially – it was designed to provide superior quality control. It was also created to drastically reduce environmental impact, substantially decrease utility demands, as well as lower production costs, while delivering customers daily harvests and higher crop yields.
 
Plants grow most robustly and flavorfully in full natural sunlight. While it may seem counterintuitive to some, even the clearest of glass greenhouses inhibit the full light spectrum of the sun. However, new translucent and transparent membrane materials have emerged recently that enable the near-full-transmission of the sun’s light spectrum.

Our Position in the Ag-Tech Sector
 
The Ag-Tech sector is severely underserved by the capital markets, and we see an opportunity to acquire global companies who have provided solutions to the industry and are leading innovation moving forward. We are creating a separate corporate office to aggressively pursue such acquisitions. The robustness of our engagement with potential targets has confirmed our belief and desire to be part of a larger integrated Ag-Tech solutions provider, where each separate element of the business has its existing legacy business and can leverage across areas of expertise to expand their business footprint. We believe that there is currently no one that we are aware of who is pursuing this model in the US capital markets environment at this time.
 
The AgriFORCE™ Grow House
 
The Company is an agriculture-focused technology company that delivers innovative and reliable, financially robust solutions for high value crops through our proprietary facility design and automation IP to businesses and enterprises globally. The Company intends to operate in the plant based pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and high value crop markets using its unique patented facility design and hydroponics based automated growing system that enable cultivators to effectively grow crops in a controlled environment (“FORCEGH+™”). The Company has designed FORCEGH+™ facilities to produce in virtually any environmental condition and to optimize crop yields to as near their full genetic potential possible while substantially eliminating the need for the use of pesticides, fungicides and/or irradiation.
 
The Company continues to develop its solution for fruits and vegetables focusing on the integration of its current structure with a new form of vertical grow technology.

AgriFORCE™ Brands
 
The Company purchased Intellectual Property (“IP”) from Manna Nutritional Group, LLC (“Manna”), a privately held firm based in Boise, Idaho on September 10, 2021. The IP encompasses a granted patent to naturally process and convert grain, pulses and root vegetables, resulting in low-starch, low-sugar, high-protein, fiber-rich baking flour as well as produces a natural sweetener juice. The core process is covered under the Patent Nr. 11,540,538 in the U.S. and key international markets. The all-natural process is designed to unlock nutritional properties, flavors and other qualities in a range of modern, ancient and heritage grains, pulses and root vegetables to create specialized all-natural baking and all-purpose flours, sweeteners, juices, naturally sweet cereals and other valuation products, providing numerous opportunities for dietary nutritional, performance and culinary applications.
 
Wheat and Flour Market
 
Modern diet is believed to be a contributor to health risks such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity, due in part to the consumption of highly processed foods that are low in natural fiber, protein and nutrition; and extremely high in simple starch, sugar and calories. These “empty carbs” produce glycemic swings that may cause overeating by triggering cravings for food high in sugar, salt and starch. As an example, conventional baking flour is low in natural fiber (~ 2-3%), low-to-average in protein (~ 9%), and very high in starch (~ 75%)(4). Whole wheat flour is only marginally better.
 
(4) Based on protein, fiber, and starch content figures from a nationally certified independent laboratory, as compared to standard all-purpose flour.

In contrast, foods high in fiber help to satiate hunger, suppress cravings and raise metabolism(5). They also assist in weight loss, lower cholesterol, and may reduce the risk of cancer, heart disease and diabetes.
 
Advantages of the UN(THINK)™ Foods IP 
 
The Controlled Enzymatic Reaction & Endothermic Saccharification with Managed Natural Germination (“CERES-MNG”) patented process allows for the development and manufacturing of all-natural flours that are significantly higher in fibers, nutrients and proteins and significantly lower in carbohydrates and calories than standard baking flour.
 
CERES-MNG baking flour produced from soft white wheat has 40 times more fiber, three (3) times more protein and 75% less net carbohydrates than regular all- purpose flour8 (6).

- | High protein, high fiber, low carb pet foods and snacks 

 
We intend to commercialize these products behind three (3) main sales channels:
 

- | Ingredients 
--+--------------------
- | Branded ingredients
- | Consumer brand 

 
The business opportunity for AgriFORCE™ to successfully commercialize premium specialized products from the UN(THINK)™ foods IP – by capturing a conservatively very small percentage share of the category it is targeting to enter in the premium segments. We estimate these revenues to be between $500 million and $1 billion by 2030 (excluding any potential revenues from the Maltose-Power Juice applications).

Status as an Emerging Growth Company
 
On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for private companies.
 
We are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an “emerging growth company,” we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions from, without limitation, (i) providing an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (a) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the closing of this offering, (b) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (c) the last day of our fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act (which would occur if the market value of our equity securities that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter), or (d) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three-year period.
