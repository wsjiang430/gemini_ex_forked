ITEM 1. Business 
Overview 
 Eagle Materials Inc., through its subsidiaries, (the Company, which may be referred to as we, our, or us) is a leading supplier of heavy construction materials, light building materials, and materials used for oil and natural gas extraction in the United States. Our products are commodities that are essential in commercial and residential construction; public construction projects; projects to build, expand, and repair roads and highways; and in oil and natural gas extraction. Demand for these products is generally cyclical and seasonal, depending on economic and geographic conditions. We distribute our products across many United States markets, which provides us with regional economic diversification. 
 The Company was founded in 1963 as a building materials subsidiary of Centex Corporation (Centex). It operated as a public company under the name Centex Construction Products, Inc. from April 19, 1994 to January 30, 2004, at which time Centex completed a tax-free distribution of its shares to its shareholders, and the company was renamed Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE: EXP).
 Strategy
 We consistently and rigorously pursue four overarching strategic objectives that differentiate us and contribute to our margin performance and growth: being a low-cost producer in all our markets, maintaining a decentralized operating structure, focusing solely in U.S. geographical markets, and achieving profitable growth through both strategic acquisitions and the organic development of our asset network. 
 Improve our low-cost producer position
 Our goal and the bedrock of our strategy, is to be a low-cost producer in each of the markets in which we compete. We focus diligently on reducing costs and making our operations more efficient. Maintaining our low-cost position provides meaningful competitive, financial, and environmental benefits.
 The products we make are basic necessities, and competition is often based largely on price, with consistent quality and customer service also important considerations. Thus, being a low-cost producer is a competitive advantage and can lead to higher margins, better returns and stronger free cash flow generation. 
 Being a low-cost producer is not only key to our commercial success, it also fully aligns with and advances our commitment to sustainable environmental practices. To maintain our low-cost producer position, we are always innovating our production processes with the aim of using fewer resources to make the same commodities. We regularly invest in technologies at our facilities to control emissions and to modify the fuels that we burn.

Maintain decentralized operating structure
 The Company operates through a decentralized structure: operations are managed separately, and products are branded and marketed by our individual companies. This local-market strategy provides several benefits, including increased familiarity with our customers, higher brand recognition, and lower transportation costs, which is a meaningful advantage in the construction materials industry. We view our cement and wallboard plant systems each as integrated networks, allowing us to ship products and minimize freight costs. The impact of regional construction cycles on our businesses is mitigated to some degree by our geographic diversification and integrated network of plants.
 Operate in attractive markets
 Demand for our products depends on construction activity which tends to correlate with population growth. While the Company’s markets include most of the United States, approximately 70% of our total revenue is generated in ten states: California, Colorado, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming. Population growth, which is a major driver of construction products and building materials demand, is expected to grow approximately 28% between the 2010 census and 2040 for these ten states, compared to 23% population growth for the United States as a whole, according to the latest update in December 2018 by the Weldon Cooper Center at the University of Virginia. In our Light Materials sector, we have located operations primarily in the southern part of the United States, known as the Sun Belt. According to the same study, population in the Sun Belt is expected to grow by approximately 38% between the 2010 census and 2040.
 Achieve profitable growth through acquisition and organic development
 We seek to grow the Company through acquisitions and the organic development of our asset network. Since 2012, we have expanded the Heavy Materials sector principally through acquisitions, with total investments of approximately $1.2 billion. Most recently, in 2017, we acquired a cement plant from Cemex in Fairborn, Ohio (the Fairborn Acquisition). These investments have more than doubled our U.S. cement capacity, making us the largest U.S.-owned cement producer. 
 The Fairborn Acquisition also expanded our geographic footprint so that we now have a contiguous, integrated cement system from California to Ohio and south to Texas. We have completed additional bolt-on acquisitions, which also contribute to our expanded geographic footprint. 
 The Company will continue to proactively pursue acquisition opportunities that further our growth across the Heavy Materials sector. Our free cash flow enables us to consider acquisitions and organic growth opportunities that align with our return on investment profitability objectives. 
 When an otherwise attractive potential acquisition or investment in organic growth does not meet our return requirements, our practice is to return cash to shareholders. Since becoming a public company in 1994, our share count is down approximately 35%, and we have returned approximately $1.8 billion to our shareholders, through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. 
 Ongoing Strategic Portfolio Review
 On April 18, 2019, we announced that the Company, with the support of our independent financial and legal advisors, is conducting a strategic review of its portfolio of businesses. The review is ongoing and the Company is carefully considering the full range of options for maximizing value to our shareholders, including a separation of our businesses, potential transactions with third parties and other strategic and financial alternatives. We do not intend to publicly discuss or announce developments with respect to the 
 2


review process until the Board has approved a definitive action or until the process has otherwise been concluded. There can be no assurance that the strategic portfolio review will result in any particular action or that a transaction will be consummated, nor can there be any assurance regarding the timing of any action or transaction.
 EMPLOYEES
 As of March 31, 2019, the Company had approximately 2,300 employees, of which approximately 800 were employed under collective bargaining agreements and various supplemental agreements with local unions.
 Industry Segment Information
 Our business is organized into three sectors: Heavy Materials, which includes the Cement and Concrete and Aggregates segments; Light Materials, which includes the Gypsum Wallbo
ard and Recycled Paperboard segments; and Oil and Gas Proppants, which are used in oil and gas extraction.

For information about the financial results of our business segments, including revenue, average net sales prices, sales volume and operating earnings, please see pages 45-52.
 Heavy Materials
 Our Heavy Materials sector provides cement and concrete and aggregates for use in infrastructure, commercial, and residential construction. This sector comprises the Cement and Concrete and Aggregates segments. Demand has been strong for these construction products over the last several years. Cement consumption in the United States, as estimated by the Portland Cement Association (PCA), was approximately 106.1 million short tons in calendar 2018, compared with 103.8 million short tons in calendar 2017, and imported cement consumption was 15% of total sales in calendar 2018 compared with 14% in calendar 2017.
 Cement
 Cement is the basic binding agent for concrete, a primary construction material. Some concrete mixes also include other cementitious materials, such as slag and fly ash, which act as cement extenders and improve the durability of concrete. The principal sources of demand for cementitious materials are infrastructure, commercial construction, and residential construction, with infrastructure accounting for approximately 50% of the demand for cement.

The manufacturing process for portland cement primarily involves four main steps, as shown in the graphic below:
 

All of our cement plants use dry-process technology, and approximately 75% of our clinker capacity is from preheater or preheater/pre-calciner kilns, which are generally more efficient kiln types.
 We also sell slag cement and fly ash. Slag granules are obtained from a steel company and processed in our grinding facility. Slag is used in concrete mix designs to improve the durability of concrete and reduce future maintenance costs. Fly ash is a by-product of a coal-fired power plant and acts as an extender of cement in concrete.

Cement Plants

 We operate seven cement plants (one of which is operated through a joint venture), one slag grinding facility, and 19 cement distribution terminals. Our 5.2 million tons of clinker capacity is approximately 5% of total U.S. clinker capacity. Our cement companies focus on the American heartland and operate as an integrated network selling product in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Our joint venture includes a minority interest in an import terminal in Houston, Texas, from which we can purchase up to 495,000 short tons annually. Our slag facility is located near Chicago, Illinois, and our slag product is sold primarily in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Ohio, Minnesota, Missouri, and Kansas. The following table sets forth information regarding our cement plants (tons are in thousands of short tons):

 All of our cement subsidiaries are wholly owned except the Buda, Texas plant (the Joint Venture), which is owned by Texas Lehigh Cement Company LP, a limited partnership joint venture owned 50% by us and 50% by Lehigh Cement Company LLC, a subsidiary of Heidelberg Cement AG. 
 Our cement production, including our 50% share of the cement Joint Venture production, totaled 4.9 million short tons in fiscal 2019 and 5.0 million short tons in fiscal 2018. Total net cement sales, including our 50% share of cement sales from the Joint Venture, were 5.3 million and 5.4 million short tons in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. 
 Raw Materials and Fuel Supplies 

 The principal raw material used in the production of portland cement is calcium carbonate in the form of limestone. Limestone is obtained primarily through mining and extraction operations conducted at quarries that we own or lease, and that are located in close proximity to our plants. We believe that the estimated recoverable limestone reserves we own or lease will permit each of our plants to operate at our 
 5


present production capacity for at least 25 years. The Company is actively seeking additional limestone reserves close to our plants and believes it will be able to acquire more reserves in the future. Other raw materials used in substantially smaller quantities than limestone are sand, clay, iron ore, and gypsum. These materials are readily available and can either be obtained from Company-owned or -leased reserves or be purchased from outside suppliers. 
 Coal and petroleum coke are the primary fuels used in our cement plants, but the plants are equipped to burn natural gas, if necessary. The cost of fuel increased in fiscal 2019, compared with fiscal 2018. The increase was due to higher coal and petroleum coke costs, as well as inbound freight costs to deliver the coal and petroleum coke. The Tulsa plant burns fuel-quality wastes, as well as coal and petroleum coke, and the Sugar Creek plant burns alternative fuels and petroleum coke. When we acquired Sugar Creek and Tulsa in late 2012, both plants had existing alternative fuels programs managed by a company that supplied alternative fuels and materials to the cement plants. In keeping with our commitment to sustainability and cost management, we continue to use these alternative fuels and materials programs at the Sugar Creek and Tulsa plants.
 We have a long-term agreement with a steel manufacturer to supply granules necessary for grinding slag. This agreement requires us to purchase up to 550,000 tons of granules, which meet certain specifications, made available by the steel manufacturer each year.
 Electric power is also a major cost component in the manufacturing process for both cement and slag, and we have sought to diminish overall power costs by adopting interruptible power supply agreements at certain locations. These agreements may expose us to some production interruptions during periods of power curtailment. Historically, we have not had many production interruptions under these agreements.
 Demand, Sales, and Distribution

 The principal sources of demand for cement and slag are infrastructure, commercial, and residential construction, with public works infrastructure comprising more than 50% of total demand. Cement consumption in the U.S. increased approximately 2% during calendar 2018 from calendar 2017, and the Portland Cement Association forecasts cement consumption will increase another approximately 2% in calendar 2019. Demand for cement is seasonal, particularly in northern states where inclement winter weather often affects construction activity. Cement sales are generally greatest from Spring through the middle of Autumn. Demand for slag has increased as the availability of fly ash has decreased due to the conversion of power plants from coal to natural gas.
 The cement industry is extremely competitive: there are multiple domestic suppliers and foreign producers who import cement through various terminal operations. Approximately 85% of the U.S. cement industry is owned by foreign international companies.
 Because of cement’s low value-to-weight ratio, the relative cost of transporting cement on land is high and limits the geographic area in which each company can market its products profitably. The low value-to-weight ratio generally limits shipments by truck to a 150-mile radius of each plant and up to 300 miles by rail; therefore, the U.S. cement industry is fragmented into regional geographic areas rather than a single national selling area. No single cement company has a distribution of plants extensive enough to serve all geographic areas, so profitability is sensitive to shifts in the balance between regional supply and demand.
 6


Cement imports into the U.S. occur primarily to supplement domestic cement production or to supply a particular region. Cement is typically imported into deep water ports, along the coast or on the Great Lakes, or it is transported on the Mississippi River system near major population centers. This is done to take advantage of lower waterborne freight costs versus higher truck and rail transportation costs that U.S.-based manufacturers incur to deliver into the same areas.
 The Portland Cement Association estimates that imports represented approximately 15% of cement used in the U.S. during calendar 2018, compared with 14% in calendar 2017.  The PCA also estimates that imports will represent approximately 16% of calendar 2019 consumption. Based on the normal distribution of cement into the market, we believe that no less than approximately 5% to 10% of the total consumption will consistently be served by imported cement.
 The following table sets forth information regarding the geographic areas served by each of our cement and slag plants and the location of our distribution terminals in each area. We have a total of 19 cement storage and distribution terminals that are strategically located to extend the sales areas of our plants.

 During fiscal 2019, the leases we had with the former owner of the Skyway Plant for terminals in Cincinnati, Ohio; Des Moines, Iowa; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Tarentum, Pennsylvania expired and were not renewed. The terminal in Tarentum, Pennsylvania was replaced by the terminal in Etna, Pennsylvania; the terminal in Cincinnati, Ohio was replaced by the terminal in Fairfield, Ohio; and the terminal in Des Moines, Iowa was replaced by the terminal in Pleasant Hills, Iowa. The lease for the terminal at Pleasant Hills, Iowa expires in fiscal 2020 and is not expected to be renewed, and the terminal will be replaced by 
 7


the terminal in Altoona, Iowa. We are currently constructing a cement dome at Altoona, Iowa, which is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2020. We are leasing the new terminal in Fairfield, Ohio under an initial term of two years, with two one-year options.
 Cement and slag are distributed directly to our customers mostly through customer pickups, and also by common carriers from our plants or distribution terminals. We transport cement and slag by barge and rail to our storage and distribution terminals. 
 No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our Cement segment sales during fiscal 2019. We do not typically enter into long-term sales contracts or have a significant level of order backlog. Cement and slag are generally sold to companies in private industry that contract with state and local entities for infrastructure and other public works projects.
 Environmental Matters

 Our cement operations are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations pertaining to health, safety, and the environment. Some of these laws, such as the federal Clean Air Act and the federal Clean Water Act (and analogous state laws) impose environmental-permitting requirements and govern the nature and amount of emissions that may be generated when conducting particular operations. Some laws, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (and analogous state laws) impose obligations to clean up or remediate spills of hazardous materials into the environment. Other laws require us to reclaim certain land upon completion of extraction and mining operations in our quarries. We believe that we have obtained all the material environmental permits that are necessary to conduct our operations. We further believe that we are conducting our operations in substantial compliance with these permits. In addition, none of our manufacturing sites is listed as a CERCLA Superfund site. 
 Eight environmental issues involving the cement manufacturing industry deserve special mention. 
 The first environmental issue involves cement kiln dust or CKD. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been evaluating the regulatory status of CKD under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for several years. In 1999, the EPA proposed a rule that would allow states to regulate properly managed CKD as a non-hazardous waste under state laws and regulations governing solid waste. In contrast, CKD that was not properly managed would be treated as a hazardous waste under RCRA. In 2002, the EPA confirmed its intention to continue to exempt properly managed CKD from the hazardous waste requirements of RCRA. The agency announced that it would collect additional data over the next three to five years to determine if the states’ regulation of CKD is effective. To date, the EPA still has not completed its 1999 proposal to exempt properly managed CKD waste and establish protective CKD management standards. It is uncertain whether or when this proposal will be finalized. Nevertheless, in the interim, many state environmental agencies have been using the EPA’s 1999 proposed CKD management standards as general industry guidelines. 
 Currently, substantially all CKD produced in connection with our ongoing operations is recycled, and therefore such CKD is not viewed as a waste under RCRA. However, CKD was historically collected and stored on-site at our Illinois, Nevada, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Wyoming cement plants and at a former plant site in Corpus Christi, Texas, which is no longer producing cement. If either the EPA or the states decide to reclassify or impose new management standards on this CKD at some point in the future, we could incur additional costs to comply with those requirements with respect to our historically collected CKD. CKD that comes in contact with water might produce a leachate with an alkalinity high enough to be classified as hazardous and might also leach certain hazardous trace metals therein. 
 8


The second environmental issue involves the historical disposal of refractory brick containing chromium. Such refractory brick was formerly used widely in the cement industry to line cement kilns. We currently use a small amount of refractory brick containing chromium, all of which is properly disposed under applicable federal and state laws. Except for such chromium containing refractory, we crush substantially all of our refractory brick and use the crushed material as raw feed in the kiln. 
 The third environmental issue involves the potential regulation of our emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), including carbon dioxide, under the Clean Air Act (CAA). The consequences of GHG emission reduction regulations for our cement operations will likely be significant because (1) the cement manufacturing process requires the combustion of large amounts of fuel to generate very high kiln temperatures; and (2) the production of carbon dioxide is a byproduct of the calcination process, whereby carbon dioxide is removed from calcium carbonate to produce calcium oxide. 
 In response to the Supreme Court’s ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA, 127 S. Ct. 1438 (2007), that GHGs are air pollutants and, thus, potentially subject to regulation under the CAA, the EPA has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions from mobile and certain stationary sources. On September 22, 2009, the EPA issued a Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases final rule, which took effect December 29, 2009. This rule established a comprehensive scheme requiring operators of stationary sources in the United States emitting more than established annual thresholds of GHGs to monitor and report their GHG emissions annually on a facility-by-facility basis. On December 15, 2009, the EPA published a final rule finding that current and projected concentrations of six key GHGs in the atmosphere threaten public health and welfare. Based on this finding, on May 7, 2010, the EPA promulgated a final rule establishing GHG emission standards for new motor vehicles under Title II of the CAA, which was the first nationwide rule controlling or limiting GHG emissions. According to the EPA, because of the issuance of the motor vehicle rule meant that GHGs were regulated pollutants under the CAA, it triggered construction and operating permit requirements for large stationary sources of GHGs, including cement plants, under Title I of the CAA. On May 13, 2010, the EPA promulgated a final rule, known as the Tailoring Rule, addressing the thresholds at which stationary sources of GHGs trigger prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) and Title V permitting requirements. PSD review requires an analysis of possible GHG controls and, potentially, the installation of GHG controls or emissions limitations.
 On June 23, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion with respect to the Tailoring Rule holding that the EPA can require PSD controls for GHG emissions only for sources that are already subject to PSD review based on another pollutant – Util. Air Regulatory Grp. v. E.P.A, 134 S. Ct. 2427 (2014). Following the Supreme Court decision, the EPA issued a memorandum clarifying that the EPA intends to continue to apply PSD requirements to GHG emissions if a source emits or has the potential to emit 75,000 tons per year (tpy) or more of GHGs until the EPA establishes a de minimis threshold for GHG emissions below which a source would not be subject to GHG PSD permitting requirements. The EPA announced its intention to propose a rule addressing the de minimis threshold for GHG PSD permitting in the summer of 2016. To date, the EPA has yet to propose such rule. Until the EPA issues a final rule addressing the de minimis threshold for GHG emissions, any major modification of our existing plants or construction of a new plant that triggers PSD review for non-GHG emissions also would trigger PSD review for GHG emissions if the proposed major modification or construction would result in a GHG emission increase of at least 75,000 tpy.
 In October 2015, the EPA published a rule establishing guidelines for states to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil fuel power plants (the Clean Power Plan). The Clean Power Plan established national performance rates for steam generating units and stationary combustion turbines as well as state emission reduction goals based on the application of the performance rates to a state’s unique generation mix. Numerous states and industry petitioners are challenging the Clean Power Plan 
 9


on multiple grounds. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed implementation of the Clean Power Plan while the litigation is pending. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) held oral argument on the consolidated challenges to the Clean Power Plan on June 2, 2016. No opinion in that case has been issued. On April 28, 2017, at the request of the U.S. EPA, the D.C. Circuit issued a per curiam order holding the case in abeyance for 60 days to allow the U.S. EPA to determine whether to reconsider the Clean Power Plan. The EPA has indicated that it intends to significantly amend or repeal the Clean Power Plan. The D.C. Circuit has continued to hold the rule challenges in abeyance and the EPA must file status reports on its deliberations every 30 days.
 On October 17, 2017, the EPA issued a proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan and set out a broad outline of options for replacing the Clean Power Plan. On August 31, 2018, the EPA proposed a new rule to replace the Clean Power Plan. The proposed rule, informally called the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, would limit GHG emission reductions to those that can occur with the fenceline of a power plant. The proposed rule identifies several qualifying technologies to improve heat rate at power plants. Under the proposed rule, standards of performance for GHG emissions would be established on a case-by-case basis by each state based on the qualifying heat rate improvement technologies. 
 In the future, it is possible that the EPA will propose performance standards for GHG emissions for other sectors, including cement manufacturing, so the ultimate outcome of the GHG regulations for power plants could affect the timing and form of standards for cement plants.
 Several states have individually implemented or are presently considering measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG inventories or registries, or regional GHG cap and trade programs. California’s AB 32 program is the most advanced of such state initiatives, with regulations affecting all major sources of GHGs. The State of Washington also issued regulations imposing emission limitations on a broad set of industry sectors, although that rule, the Clean Air Rule, was invalidated by a state court judge on December 15, 2017. Washington appealed the ruling to its state supreme court, which heard oral arguments on March 19, 2019, but has not yet issued a decision. States also have joined together to form regional initiatives to reduce GHG emissions, including nine states in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Two additional states are in the process of joining RGGI.
 It is not possible at this time to predict how any future legislation that may be enacted or final EPA regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business. However, any imposition of raw materials or production limitations, fuel-use or carbon taxes, or emission limitations or reductions could have a significant impact on the cement manufacturing industry and a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.
 The fourth environmental issue is the EPA’s promulgation on September 9, 2010 of final regulations establishing National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for portland cement plants (PC NESHAP) pursuant to Section 112 of the CAA. For specific hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), the final rule requires cement plants to meet certain emission and operating standards. The rule sets limits on mercury emissions from existing portland cement kilns and increases the stringency of emission limits for new kilns. The rule sets emission limits for total hydrocarbons, and also sets emission limits for particulate matter as a surrogate for non-volatile metal HAPS, from cement kilns of all sizes, and reduces hydrochloric acid emissions from kilns that are large emitters. As a result of industry challenges to the regulations, the EPA issued a revised rule on February 12, 2013. The revised rule made two notable changes to the 2010 HAP regulations. First, the rule established less stringent emission standards for total hydrocarbons and particulate matter. Second, the rule extended the deadline for existing sources to comply with the HAP regulations to September 9, 2015. We do not believe we are placed at a competitive 
 10


disadvantage by the revised rule. Pursuant to CAA Sections 112(d) and (f), the EPA determined on July 25, 2018, that no revisions to the HAP regulations are necessary to address residual risk from HAP emissions from portland cement plants, nor to account for developments in practices, process or control technologies. This determination has been challenged by environmental groups in the D.C. Circuit. The litigation in the D.C. Circuit is being held in abeyance while the EPA considers the environmental groups’ administrative petition for reconsideration of the determination.  
 A fifth environmental issue involves excess emissions that may occur during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction. In June 2015, the EPA issued a rule requiring revisions to 36 state implementation plans (SIPs) that allowed exemptions or contained affirmative defenses to excess emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction (SSM rule). The SIP revisions were submitted to the EPA in November 2016. The states required to revise their SIPs include states where the company has cement operations, such as Illinois, Oklahoma, Missouri, and Texas. Under the revised SIPs, companies would be required to comply with their emissions limits at all times, including during startup, shutdown, and malfunctions. States and members of industry have challenged the SSM rule in the D.C. Circuit. In addition, the State of Texas filed a petition with the EPA on March 15, 2017, requesting that the Agency reconsider the SSM rule as it applied to the Texas SIP.
 On April 24, 2017, at the request of the EPA, the D.C. Circuit issued an order holding in abeyance the consolidated challenges to the SSM rule and canceling oral argument, which had been scheduled for May 8, 2017. In its motion, the EPA argued that oral argument should be delayed in light of the recent change in Administration. According to the motion, the EPA “intends to closely review the SSM rule, and the prior positions taken by the Agency with respect to the SSM rule may not necessarily reflect its ultimate conclusions after that review is complete.” The D.C. Circuit’s order requires the EPA to file status reports on the Agency’s review of the SSM rule at 90-day intervals. It further mandates that the parties file motions to govern future proceedings within 30 days of the EPA notifying the court and the parties what action it has or will be taking with respect to the SSM rule. As a result, we cannot predict how or whether the SSM rule will be changed.
 On April 29, 2019, EPA Region 6 (which oversees a group of states that includes New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas) published a proposed finding that the affirmative defense provisions in Texas’s SIP applicable to excess emissions during periods of SSM are narrowly tailored and limited enough to be consistent with the CAA. Accordingly, EPA Region 6 also is proposing to withdraw the SSM rule as it applies to the Texas SIP, which means Texas would no longer be required to revise its SIP to address its existing affirmative defense provisions. The EPA is accepting public comment on the proposed rule through June 28, 2019. At this time, EPA Region 6 is not proposing to address other states’ affirmative defense SIP provisions; however, the Agency notes in the Texas proposal that it is considering reinstating the EPA’s prior policy that affirmative defense SIP provisions are generally approvable in Region 6 states.
 The sixth environmental issue is the EPA’s promulgation pursuant to Section 129 of the CAA of revised regulations for Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration (CISWI) units. CAA Section 129 requires the EPA to set standards for solid-waste incineration units. Affected sources must comply with the revised CISWI regulations the earlier of three years after State CISWI plan approval, or five years from the date of the final rule on reconsideration. On June 23, 2016, the EPA published a final rule reconsidering four provisions of the February 7, 2013 final CISWI rule, including relaxing the particulate matter standard for solid waste-burning kilns and eliminating the affirmative defense to penalties for non-compliance during well-documented malfunction events. On January 11, 2017, the EPA published a proposed federal plan that would implement the previously promulgated limits for existing CISWI units in states that have not submitted and received approval for a state plan. The proposed federal plan would have required owners or operators of impacted CISWI units to achieve compliance by February 7, 2018; 
 11


however, the EPA has yet to finalize the proposed federal plan. The EPA has approved several states’ implementation plans, including plans submitted by Colorado and Oklahoma. Compared to the PC NESHAP, the CISWI regulations contain requirements for more pollutants, and the requirement for dioxin/furans for existing and new sources is somewhat more stringent.
 Whether a facility is a CISWI unit regulated under CAA Section 129 or a cement plant regulated under CAA Section 112 hinges on whether it combusts solid waste as that term is defined under Subtitle D of RCRA. On March 21, 2011, the EPA finalized (and on February 7, 2013, it revised) the Identification of Non-Hazardous Secondary Materials that Are Solid Waste (NHSM) rule. The NHSM rule’s primary purpose is to provide the definition of solid waste that is used to determine if a cement kiln is regulated under CISWI regulations or the PC NESHAP regulations. The rule lays out processing and legitimacy criteria that are used to determine if a non-traditional fuel is a solid waste. Combustion of a solid waste triggers applicability of the CISWI requirements. On July 29, 2016, the D.C. Circuit issued an opinion in U.S. Sugar v. EPA, No. 11-1108, largely upholding the 2011 and 2013 CISWI rules.
 At some of our operations, kilns are or will be using non-hazardous secondary materials as a replacement for traditional fuels used in the manufacturing process. These kiln systems are capable of beneficially utilizing a wide array of NHSM and may be subject to the CISWI requirements, depending on whether these materials are identified as solid wastes under the NHSM rule. The EPA issued a rule clarifying the definition of solid waste and establishing a uniform recycling standard for all hazardous secondary materials recycling on January 13, 2015, which became effective on July 13, 2015. Solid waste–burning kilns must meet the CISWI emission and operating standards. Nonwaste-burning kilns must prove any alternative fuels used are not solid wastes. We do not believe we are placed at a competitive disadvantage by either the NHSM or the CISWI rule.
 The seventh environmental issue is a revision to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for hazardous waste combustors (HWC NESHAP). The Tulsa, Oklahoma cement facility utilizes hazardous waste as fuel and is required to meet the emission and operating standards of the HWC NESHAP. This facility has demonstrated and remains in compliance with all of the requirements of the current HWC NESHAP. On October 12, 2005, the EPA promulgated final HWC regulations, with compliance required for all facilities by 2008. On October 28, 2008, the EPA promulgated a final rule addressing eight issues for which the EPA granted reconsideration of the 2005 rule. The final rule on reconsideration did not change the compliance date for existing sources established by the 2005 rule. Environmental and industry organizations filed lawsuits in the D.C. Circuit challenging the 2005 and 2008 regulations. The EPA subsequently agreed to revise the HWC NESHAP in accordance with an agreement with litigants, and the court in August 2009 granted EPA’s motion for voluntary remand, without vacatur, of the 2005 and 2008 regulations to the EPA for further consideration. The EPA has not indicated when it will issue a propo
sed rule amending the regulations. It is not possible to predict at this time the stringency or impact of revised HWC NESHAP regulations or timing required for compliance. 
 The eighth environmental issue is the EPA’s ongoing review and implementation of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone. In October 2015, the EPA strengthened the ozone NAAQS by lowering the primary (health-based) and secondary (welfare-based) standards from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb. As a result of this change, the EPA was required to make attainment/nonattainment designations for the revised standards by October 2017. In November 2017, the EPA released a partial list of 2,649 counties (representing about 85 percent of U.S. counties) that meet the 2015 standards for ground level ozone or are not classifiable. States containing the remaining undesignated areas were notified by the EPA in December 2017 of the Agency’s intended recommendations and were given 120 days to provide additional information for the EPA to consider before making final designation decisions. On April 30, 2018, the agency released the area designations for all of the remaining undesignated 
 12


counties, except for eight counties in the San Antonio, Texas area.  The EPA designated 51 areas as nonattainment, one area as unclassifiable, and the remaining areas as attainment/unclassifiable. Most of the nonattainment areas were classified as marginal nonattainment. On July 17, 2018, the EPA released the area designations for the eight remaining Texas counties, seven of which were designated as attainment/unclassifiable and one, Bexar County, classified as being in marginal nonattainment. Nonattainment designations in or surrounding our areas of operations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial results. The CAA requires the EPA to review, and if necessary, revise the NAAQS every five years. Accordingly, the EPA is in the process of reviewing the ozone NAAQS, and is scheduled to complete this review in 2020.
 We believe that our current procedures and practices in our operations, including those for handling and managing hazardous materials, are consistent with industry standards and are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Nevertheless, because of the complexity of our operations and the environmental laws to which we are subject, there can be no assurance that past or future operations will not result in violations, remediation costs, or other liabilities or claims. Moreover, we cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted or adopted in the future or how such future environmental laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. Compliance with more stringent environmental laws, or stricter interpretation of existing environmental laws, could necessitate significant capital outlays.
 In fiscal 2019, we had $4.7 million of capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental regulations applicable to our cement operations. We anticipate spending $7.0 million during fiscal 2020.
 Concrete and Aggregates 
 Readymix concrete is a versatile, low-cost building material used in almost all construction. The production of readymix concrete involves mixing cement, sand, gravel, or crushed stone and water to form concrete, which is then sold and distributed to numerous construction contractors. Concrete is produced in batch plants and transported to customers’ job sites in mixer trucks. 
 The aggregates business consists of mining, extracting, producing, and selling crushed stone, sand, gravel, and lightweight aggregates such as expanded clays and shales. Construction aggregates of suitable characteristics are employed in virtually all types of construction, including the production of readymix concrete and asphaltic mixes used in highway construction and maintenance. 
 Concrete and Aggregates Plants

 We have 17 concrete batching plants and four aggregates facilities. We produce and distribute readymix concrete from company-owned sites north of Sacramento, California; Austin, Texas; and the greater Kansas City area. The following table sets forth information regarding these operations.

Location | Number of Plants | | Number of Trucks
--------------------+------------------+----+-----------------
Northern California | | 3 | | 25 
Austin, Texas | | 6 | | 85 
Kansas City Area | | 8 | | 91 
Total | | 17 | | 201

 
13


We conduct aggregate operations near our concrete facilities in northern California; Austin, Texas; and the greater Kansas City area. Aggregates are obtained principally by mining and extracting from quarries owned or leased by the Company. The following table sets forth certain information regarding these aggregate facilities. 
 
 
Location | Owned or Leased | Types of Aggregates | Estimated Annual Production Capacity (Thousand tons) | | Estimated Minimum Reserves (Thousand Tons) (1) | | Estimated Minimum Reserves (Years) | | Fiscal 2019 Tons Mined (Thousand Tons)

(1) | All reserves are considered to be probable under the definition of Industry Guide 7.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Includes reserves located in our underground mine that we believe can be economically used for aggregate supply.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our total net aggregate sales were 3.2 million tons in fiscal 2019 and 3.5 million tons in fiscal 2018. Total aggregates production was 3.4 million tons in fiscal 2019 and 3.9 million tons in fiscal 2018. A portion of our total aggregates production is used internally by our readymix concrete operations in Texas, the greater Kansas City area, and California. 
 Raw Materials and Fuel Supplies

 We obtain cement and aggregates for our concrete businesses from related companies, including our Joint Venture, as outlined below:
 
 
 | Percentage of Internally Supplied | 
--------------------+-----------------------------------+----
Location | Cement | | | Aggregates
Northern California | | 100 | % | | 80 | %
Austin, Texas | | 35 | % | | 45 | %
Kansas City Area | | 100 | % | | 25 | %

 
We obtain the balance of our cement and aggregates requirements from multiple outside sources in each of these areas. 
 We mine and extract limestone, sand, and gravel, the principal raw materials used in the production of aggregates, from quarries owned or leased by us and located near our plants. The quarry serving our northern California business is estimated to contain more than nine hundred million tons of sand and gravel reserves. One of the quarries serving our Austin, Texas market is covered by a lease that expires in 2060. Based on current production capacity, we estimate our northern California and Austin, Texas quarries contain reserves of more than 100 years and approximately 23 years, respectively. Including reserves in our underground mine, our quarries in the Kansas City market currently have approximately 50 years of reserves. We are actively seeking additional, more economical reserves to extend the life of our reserves in the Kansas City market. 
 Demand, Sales, and Distribution 

 Demand for readymix concrete and aggregates largely depends on local levels of construction activity. Construction activity is also subject to weather conditions, the availability of financing at reasonable rates, and overall fluctuations in local economies, and therefore tends to be cyclical. We sell readymix concrete to numerous contractors and other customers in each plant’s marketing area. Our batch plants in Austin, Texas, the greater Kansas City area, and northern California are strategically located to serve each marketing area. Concrete is delivered from the batch plants primarily by company-owned trucks. 
 14


We sell aggregates to building contractors and other customers engaged in a wide variety of construction activities. Aggregates are delivered from our aggregate plants by common carriers and customer pick-up. We are continuing our efforts to secure a rail link from our principal aggregates deposit north of Sacramento, California to supply extended markets in northern California. No customer accounted for more than 10% of fiscal 2019 segment revenue. 
 The concrete and aggregates industry is highly fragmented, with numerous participants operating in each local area. Because the cost of transporting concrete and aggregates is very high relative to product values, producers of concrete and aggregates typically can profitably sell their products only in areas within 50 miles of their production facilities. Barriers to entry in each industry are low, except with respect to environmental permitting requirements for new aggregates production facilities and zoning of land to permit mining and extraction of aggregates. 
 Environmental Matters 

 The concrete and aggregates industry is subject to environmental regulations similar to those governing our Cement operations. (See pages 8-13.)
 In fiscal 2019, we had $0.5 million of capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental regulations applicable to our Concrete and Aggregates operations. We anticipate spending approximately $0.5 million in fiscal 2020. 
 Light Materials
 Our Light Materials sector produces gypsum wallboard, which is used in residential and commercial buildings, and recycled paperboard, which is used primarily in the manufacture of gypsum wallboard. The sector comprises the Gypsum Wallboard and Recycled Paperboard segments. Operations in this sector are concentrated in the Sun Belt of the United States, where the population is projected to grow approximately 38% between 2010 and 2040, according to the latest update in December 2018 by the Weldon Cooper Center at the University of Virginia. Population growth is a key long-term driver of demand for gypsum wallboard and recycled paperboard. 
Gypsum Wallboard
 
Gypsum wallboard is used to finish the interior walls and ceilings in residential, commercial, and industrial structures. Our gypsum wallboard products are marketed under the name American Gypsum. 
 The gypsum wallboard manufacturing process involves four main steps, as shown in the graphic below.

Gypsum Wallboard Plants

 We own and operate five gypsum wallboard plants, outlined in the table below, and market our products under the name American Gypsum. We anticipate running all of our facilities at the level required to meet customer demand, up to maximum capacity. Our gypsum wallboard is distributed in the geographic markets nearest to our production facilities.
 The following table sets forth certain information regarding our gypsum wallboard plants.

 Our Gypsum Wallboard production totaled 2,691 MMSF in fiscal 2019 and 2,614 MMSF in fiscal 2018. Total Gypsum Wallboard sales were 2,651 MMSF in fiscal 2019 and 2,555 MMSF in fiscal 2018.
 Raw Materials and Fuel Supplies

 We mine and extract natural gypsum rock, the principal raw material used in the manufacture of gypsum wallboard, from mines and quarries owned, leased, or subject to mining claims owned by the Company and located near our plants. Certain of our New Mexico reserves are under lease with the Pueblo of Zia. Gypsum ore reserves at the Gypsum, Colorado plant are contained within a total of 115 placer claims encompassing 2,300 acres. Included in this are 94 unpatented mining claims where mineral rights can be developed upon completion of permitting requirements. We currently own land containing gypsum in the area of Duke, Oklahoma, with additional reserves controlled through a lease agreement. Other gypsum deposits are located near the plant in Duke, which we believe may be obtained at a reasonable cost when needed. We are currently in the tenth year of a 60-year supply agreement (original 20-year term with two 20-year extension options) with a public utility in South Carolina for synthetic gypsum, which we use at our Georgetown, South Carolina plant. If the utility is unable to generate the agreed-upon amount of gypsum, it is responsible for providing gypsum from a third party to fulfill its obligations. 
 Through our modern low-cost paperboard mill, we manufacture sufficient quantities of paper necessary for our gypsum wallboard production. Paper is a significant cost component in the manufacture of gypsum wallboard, currently representing approximately one-third of our cost of production. 
 Our gypsum wallboard manufacturing operations use natural gas and electrical power. A significant portion of the Company’s natural gas requirements for our gypsum wallboard plants are currently provided by three gas producers under gas-supply agreements expiring in August 2019 for New Mexico and October 2019 for South Carolina, Colorado, and Oklahoma. If the agreements are not renewed, we 
 16


anticipate being able to obtain our gas supplies from other suppliers at competitive prices. Electrical power is supplied to our New Mexico plants at standard industrial rates by a local utility. For our Albuquerque plant we have an interruptible power supply agreement, which may expose it to some production interruptions during periods of power curtailment. Power for our Gypsum, Colorado facility is generated at the facility by a cogeneration power plant that we own and operate. Currently, the cogeneration power facility supplies power and waste hot gases for drying to the gypsum wallboard plant. We do not sell any power to third parties. Gas costs represented approximately 8% of our production costs in fiscal 2019.
 Demand, Sales, and Distribution

 The principal sources of demand for gypsum wallboard are (i) residential construction, (ii) repair and remodeling, (iii) non-residential construction, and (iv) other markets such as exports and manufactured housing. Industry shipments of gypsum wallboard were approximately 24.9 billion square feet in calendar 2018, compared to 25.3 billion square feet in calendar 2017. We estimate that residential and repair and remodel construction accounted for more than 85% of calendar 2018 industry sales. 
 Demand for gypsum wallboard remains highly cyclical and closely follows construction industry cycles, particularly housing construction. Demand for wallboard can be seasonal and is generally highest from Spring through the middle of Autumn. 
 We sell Gypsum Wallboard to numerous building-materials dealers, gypsum wallboard specialty distributors, lumber yards, home-center chains, and other customers located throughout the United States, with the exception of the Northeast. Gypsum wallboard is sold on a delivered basis, mostly by truck. We generally use third-party common carriers for deliveries. Three customers accounted for approximately 30% of our Gypsum Wallboard segment sales during fiscal 2019. 
 Although gypsum wallboard is distributed principally in local areas, certain industry producers (including the Company) have the ability to ship gypsum wallboard by rail outside their usual regional distribution areas to regions where demand is strong. We own approximately 100 railcars for transporting gypsum wallboard. Our rail distribution capabilities permit us to service customers in markets on both the east and west coasts, except for the Northeast. Less than 10% of our Wallboard volume sold was delivered via rail.
 There are seven manufacturers of gypsum wallboard in the U.S. operating a total of 62 plants, per the Gypsum Association. During 2018, Gebr. Knauf KG (Knauf) reached an agreement to acquire USG, and the transaction closed on April 24, 2019. We estimate that the three largest producers ‒ Knauf, National Gypsum Company, and Koch Industries ‒ account for approximately 60% of gypsum wallboard sales in the U.S. 
 Total wallboard-rated production capacity in the United States is currently estimated at approximately 40.0 billion square feet per year; however, certain lines have been curtailed and plants closed or idled. It is possible that previously closed plants or lines could be brought back into service. 
 Environmental Matters

 The gypsum wallboard industry is subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations pertaining to health, safety, and the environment. Some of these laws, such as the federal Clean Air Act and the federal Clean Water Act (and analogous state laws), impose environmental permitting requirements and govern the nature and amount of emissions that may be generated when conducting particular operations. Some laws, such as CERCLA (and analogous state laws), impose obligations to clean up or remediate spills of hazardous materials into the environment. Other laws require us to reclaim 
 17


certain land upon completion of extraction and mining operations in our quarries. None of our gypsum wallboard operations is the subject of any local, state, or federal environmental proceedings. We do not, and have not, used asbestos in any of our gypsum wallboard products. 
 On April 17, 2015, the EPA published its final rule addressing the storage, reuse, and disposal of coal combustion products, which include fly ash and flue gas desulfurization gypsum (synthetic gypsum). We use synthetic gypsum in wallboard manufactured at our Georgetown, South Carolina plant. The rule, which applies only to electric utilities and independent power producers, establishes standards for the management of coal combustion residuals (CCRs) under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, (RCRA), which is the Subtitle that regulates non-hazardous wastes. The rule imposes requirements addressing CCR surface impoundments and landfills, including location restrictions, design, and operating specifications; groundwater monitoring requirements; corrective action requirements; recordkeeping and reporting obligations; and closure requirements. Beneficial encapsulated uses of CCRs, including synthetic gypsum, are exempt from regulation. The rule became effective on October 19, 2015. Given the EPA’s decision to continue to allow CCR to be used in synthetic gypsum and to regulate CCR under the non-hazardous waste sections of RCRA, we do not expect the rule to materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Similarly, material effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations are unlikely to result from administrative reconsideration by the EPA of certain aspects of the final CCR rule, because none of these pending actions currently seek to overturn the management of CCR as non-hazardous waste or the regulatory exemption for beneficial encapsulated use of CCR.
 As discussed in greater detail in the “Environmental Matters” section for Cement, the EPA in October 2015 strengthened the NAAQS for ozone by lowering the primary and secondary standards from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb. The EPA completed its attainment/nonattainment designations for the revised standards for all areas of the United States in July 2018. Nonattainment designations in or surrounding our areas of operations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial results. EPA is in the process of reviewing the ozone NAAQS, which it is required to do every five years to determine if it is necessary to revise the standards.
 Our gypsum wallboard manufacturing process combusts natural gas. It is possible that GHG emissions from our manufacturing could become subject to regulation under the CAA. For a more detailed discussion of this issue, see the “Environmental Matters” section of our Cement business description on pages 8-13.
 Although our Gypsum Wallboard operations could be adversely affected by federal, regional, or state climate change initiatives, at this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business. However, any imposition of raw materials or production limitations, fuel-use or carbon taxes, or emission limitations or reductions could have a significant impact on the gypsum wallboard manufacturing industry and a material adverse effect on the financial results of our operations.
 There were $0.2 million of capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental regulations applicable to our Gypsum Wallboard operations during fiscal 2019. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $0.3 million related to our Gypsum Wallboard operations during fiscal 2020. 
 18


Recycled Paperboard 
 Our Recycled Paperboard manufacturing operation, which we refer to as Republic Paperboard Company, is located in Lawton, Oklahoma, and has a technologically advanced paper machine designed primarily for gypsum liner production. The paper’s uniform cross-directional strength and finish characteristics facilitate the efficiencies of new high-speed wallboard manufacturing lines and improve the efficiencies of the slower wallboard manufacturing lines. Although the machine was designed primarily to manufacture gypsum liner products, we are also able to manufacture several alternative products, including containerboard grades and lightweight packaging grades. To maximize manufacturing efficiencies, primarily recycled industrial paperboard grades are produced.
Our paper machine allows the paperboard operation to manufacture high-strength gypsum liner that is approximately 10-15% lighter in basis weight than generally available in the U.S. The low-basis weight product utilizes less recycled fiber to produce paper that, in turn, requires less energy (natural gas) to evaporate moisture from the board during the gypsum wallboard manufacturing process. The low-basis weight paper also reduces the overall finished board weight, providing our Wallboard operations with more competitive transportation costs for both the inbound and outbound segments. 
 We intend to invest approximately $70.0 million to expand and enhance our papermill, which has been sold out for several years. This project will enable the facility to increase line speeds, which in turn increases output, and to replace high-cost raw materials with a lower-cost, more sustainable alternative. We expect the project to be completed by late spring 2020 and to increase our paper capacity by approximately 70,000 tons.
 Raw Materials and Fuel Supplies 

 The principal raw materials in recycled paperboard are recycled paper fiber (recovered waste paper), water, and specialty paper chemicals. The largest waste paper source used by the operation is old cardboard containers (known as OCC). A blend of high grades (white papers consisting of ink-free papers such as news blank and unprinted papers) is used in the gypsum liner facing paper, white top linerboard, and white bag liner grades. 
 We believe that an adequate supply of OCC recycled fiber will continue to be available from sources located within a reasonable proximity of the paper mill. Although we have the capability to receive rail shipments, the vast majority of the recycled fiber purchased is delivered via truck. Prices are subject to market fluctuations based on generation of material (supply), demand, and the presence of the export market. Fiber prices in fiscal 2019 declined compared with fiber prices during fiscal 2018, which were higher than historical fiber prices. The current outlook for fiscal 2020 is for waste paper prices, namely OCC, to be lower compared with fiscal 2019. Current gypsum liner customer contracts include price escalators that partially offset and compensate for changes in raw material fiber prices. The chemicals used in the paper making operation, including size, retention aids, biocides, and bacteria controls, are readily available from several manufacturers at competitive prices. 
 The manufacture of recycled paperboard involves the use of a large volume of water in the production process. We have an agreement with the City of Lawton municipal services for supply of water to our manufacturing facility. Electricity, natural gas, and other utilities are available to us at either contracted rates or standard industrial rates in adequate supplies. These utilities are subject to standard industrial curtailment provisions. 
 19


Paperboard operations are generally large consumers of energy, primarily natural gas and electricity. We expect the cost of energy to remain consistent in fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019. Electricity is supplied to the paper mill by Public Service of Oklahoma (PSO) and the Oklahoma Corporate Commission recently approved a 2% rate increase for the price of electricity. This power company is working to switch its fuel source dependency to natural gas, which could affect our electricity rates in future years. Oklahoma is a regulated state for electricity services, and all rate change requests must be presented to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission for review and approval before implementation. Natural gas costs in fiscal 2019 increased compared with fiscal 2018 but they are expected to decline in fiscal 2020. A significant portion of our natural gas requirements for our paper mill is provided under a gas supply agreement that expires in January 2020.  
 Demand, Sales, and Distribution 

 Our manufactured recycled paperboard products are sold to gypsum wallboard manufacturers and other industrial users. During fiscal 2019, approximately 40% of the recycled paperboard sold by our paper mill was consumed by the Company’s Gypsum Wallboard manufacturing operations. We also have contracts with three other gypsum wallboard manufacturers that represent approximately 55% of our total segment revenue with the remaining volume shipped to other gypsum liner manufacturers. The current contracts with other gypsum wallboard manufacturers expire in four to six years. The loss of any of these contracts or a termination or reduction of their current production of gypsum wallboard, unless replaced by a commercially similar arrangement, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Environmental Matters 

 There were no capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental regulations applicable to our Recycled Paperboard operations during fiscal 2019, and none are expected in 2020.
 Oil and Gas Proppants
 
The Oil and Gas Proppants sector produces frac sand used in oil and natural gas exploration, and provides transloading and storage for well servicing companies. 
 Facilities
 We currently own two northern white frac sand mines, three frac sand wet processing plants, and four frac sand drying facilities. Our frac sand mines and wet plants are in New Auburn, Wisconsin and Utica, Illinois. Our frac sand drying facilities are currently in New Auburn, Wisconsin; Utica, Illinois; and Corpus Christi, Texas, as outlined in the table below. Sand is processed into various mesh sizes and marketed primarily to oil service companies.

 During fiscal 2019, we completed the build-out of our Utica, Illinois facility that was started in fiscal 2018. The facility was completed in June 2018, and we began shipping sand out of this facility in July 2018. During fiscal 2018, we recommissioned our Corpus Christi plant which we idled in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. This plant operated for the first four months of fiscal 2019 before it was idled, and it remained idled through the end of the fiscal year. The Corpus Christi plant can be supplied with wet sand via barge from our mine in Utica, Illinois, or other outside sources. The cost of maintaining the idled Corpus Christi plant is not significant. 
 Raw Materials and Fuel Supplies 
 We mine our frac sand from open pit mines and process the sand in our wet plants. The excavation process includes stripping the overburden overlaying the planned mining area and then removing the sand through blasting or mechanically removing it with the use of mobile equipment. Processing includes washing the sand with water and screening to remove nonsalable material, after which the sand is dried and further screened to its final mesh sizes, which range from 20 mesh to 140 mesh. During the winter months, the cold weather adversely affects our ability to operate our wet processing plants, resulting in these plants being shut down for much of the winter. Generally, our New Auburn, Wisconsin facility is affected more by the weather than our Utica, Illinois facility.
 Natural gas is the major fuel used in our dry plants. The cost of natural gas increased throughout fiscal 2019 and is not expected to fluctuate materially in fiscal 2020. Electricity and water are also a major cost component in our manufacturing process. We do not anticipate significant changes in the cost of these utilities in fiscal 2020.
 Demand, Sales, and Distribution
 Frac sand is currently sold into shale deposit zones across the United States. Demand for oil and gas proppants is driven primarily by rig counts and well‒completion activity.
 Drilling and completion activity for oil and gas is very cyclical in nature. Drilling activity is based on many factors, but the primary factor is oil and gas pricing. During the first half of calendar 2018, drilling activity was strong, and demand was steady. Demand declined during the second half of calendar 2018 as oil prices declined. Demand in the Permian Basin was also affected by the shortage of pipeline capacity, which made it difficult to move the oil from the basin to the refineries. Additional pipeline capacity is being 
 21


constructed, and is expected to be completed by the end of calendar 2019. Pricing for northern white sand was adversely affected by the decreased demand and the increased availability and use of in-basin sand, which has a lower cost due to the proximity of the sand to the wellhead.  
 A portion of the frac sand we produce is sold under long-term contracts that require our customers to pay a specified price per mesh size for a specified volume of sand each month or quarter, depending on the contract. The terms of our contracts, including pricing, delivery, and mesh distribution, vary by customer. Certain of our long-term customer contracts contain liquidated damages for non-performance by our customers. As the demand has slowed, we have negotiated new contract terms with certain of our customers. The renegotiated contracts reflect the reduced demand for frac sand in the current environment by restructuring the contracts to provide reduced contracted sales volume and prices in the near term, with the contracted minimums being increased in the later years. In addition to the long-term sales contracts, we sell frac sand through our distribution network under short-term pricing and other agreements. The terms of our short-term pricing agreements vary by customer.
 We currently have contracts to provide frac sand to four customers, which comprised approximately 85% of our segment revenue for fiscal 2019. These contracts have an average remaining life of approximately two years.
 
The frac sand distribution business offers transload services to oil field service companies.  These services are provided across several basins, through the following primary facilities:

Our Hannibal, Ohio distribution terminal is served by barge as well as by rail, and the Kenedy, Texas and Fowlerton, Texas trans-load sites are served by truck from Corpus Christi, Texas. All other distribution locations are served by rail from either our Utica, Illinois or New Auburn, Wisconsin locations. At March 31, 2019, the Kenedy, Texas; Fowlerton, Texas; Gonzales, Texas; Odessa, Texas; and Batesville, Arkansas terminals were idled. The cost of maintaining these idled facilities is not significant.
 At March 31, 2019, we had approximately 2,000 rail cars under lease, with an average term of approximately 3 years.
 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, continued declining prices and operating results in our Oil and Gas Proppants business indicated there were impairment indicators related to our long-lived assets. We reviewed our long-lived, intangible and other assets and determined that certain assets were impaired, and we recorded a $220.3 million impairment loss at March 31, 2019. See Footnote (A) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on this impairment.

Environmental Matters 
 We and the commercial silica industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation pertaining to matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, hazardous materials, air and water emissions, and environmental contamination and reclamation. A variety of federal, state, and local agencies implement and enforce these regulations.
Federal Regulation

At the federal level, we may be required to obtain permits under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands and streams, in connection with our operations. We also may be required to obtain permits under Section 402 of the Clean Water Act from the EPA or the state environmental agencies, to which the EPA has delegated local implementation of the permit program, for discharges of pollutants into waters of the United States, including discharges of wastewater or storm-water runoff associated with construction activities. Failure to obtain these required permits, or to comply with their terms, could subject us to administrative, civil, and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief.
 The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. These regulatory programs may require us to install expensive emissions abatement equipment, modify operational practices, and obtain permits for existing or new operations. Before commencing construction on a new or modified source of air emissions, such laws may require us to reduce emissions at existing facilities. As a result, we may be required to incur increased capital and operating costs to comply with these regulations. We could be subject to administrative, civil, and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations.
 As part of our operations, we use or store petroleum products and other substances such as diesel fuel, lubricating oils, and hydraulic fluid. We are subject to regulatory programs pertaining to the storage, use, transportation, and disposal of these substances. Spills or releases may occur in the course of our operations, and we could incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases, including claims for damage or injury to property and persons. CERCLA and comparable state laws may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed of, or arranged for disposal, including offsite disposal, of a hazardous substance generated or released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
 In addition, RCRA and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal, and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. The EPA and state environmental agencies, to which the EPA has delegated portions of the RCRA program for local implementation, administer the RCRA program.
 Our operations may also be subject to broad environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of all “major federal actions” significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The granting of a federal permit for a major development project, such as a mining operation, may be considered a “major federal 
 23


action” that requires review under NEPA. Therefore, our projects may require review and evaluation under NEPA. As part of this evaluation, the federal agency considers a broad array of environmental impacts, including, among other things, impacts on air quality, water quality, wildlife (including threatened and endangered species), historic and archaeological resources, geology, socioeconomics, and aesthetics. NEPA also requires the consideration of alternatives to the project. The NEPA review process, especially the preparation of a full environmental impact statement, can be time consuming and expensive. The purpose of the NEPA review process is to inform federal agencies’ decision-making on whether federal approval should be granted for a project and to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on the environmental impacts of a proposed project. Though NEPA requires only that an environmental evaluation be conducted and does not mandate a particular result, a federal agency could decide to deny a permit or impose certain conditions on its approval, based on its environmental review under NEPA, or a third party could challenge the adequacy of a NEPA review in court and thereby delay or block the issuance of a federal permit or approval.
 Federal agencies granting permits for our operations also must consider impacts to endangered and threatened species and their habitat under the Endangered Species Act. We also must comply with, and are subject to liability under, the Endangered Species Act, which prohibits and imposes stringent penalties for the harming of endangered or threatened species and their habitat. Federal agencies also must consider a project’s impacts on historic or archaeological resources under the National Historic Preservation Act, and we may be required to conduct archaeological surveys of project sites and to avoid or preserve historical areas or artifacts.
 State and Local Regulation

 We are also subject to a variety of state and local environmental review and permitting requirements. Some states, including Wisconsin where one of our operations is located, have state laws similar to NEPA; thus, our development of a new site or the expansion of an existing site may be subject to comprehensive state environmental reviews even if the project is not subject to NEPA. In some cases, the state environmental review may be more stringent than the federal review. Our operations may require state-law based permits in addition to federal permits, which obligate state agencies to consider a range of issues, many the same as federal agencies, including, among other things, a project’s impact on wildlife and their habitats, historic and archaeological sites, aesthetics, agricultural operations, and scenic areas. Wisconsin and some other states also have specific permitting and review processes for commercial silica mining operations, and state agencies may impose different or additional monitoring or mitigation requirements than federal agencies. The development of new sites and our existing operations also are subject to a variety of local environmental and regulatory requirements, including land use, zoning, building, and transportation requirements.
 Some local communities have expressed concern regarding silica sand mining operations. These concerns have generally included exposure to ambient silica sand dust, truck traffic, water usage, and blasting. In response, certain state and local communities have developed, or are in the process of developing, regulations or zoning restrictions intended to minimize the potential for dust to become airborne, control the flow of truck traffic, significantly curtail the area available for mining activities, require compensation to local residents for potential impacts of mining activities and, in some cases, ban issuance of new permits for mining activities. We are not aware of any proposals for significant increased scrutiny on the part of state or local regulators in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or community concerns with respect to our operations that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations going forward.
 24


Existing operations could be more significantly affected by increased regulatory activity. In an effort to minimize these risks, we continue to be engaged with local communities in order to grow and maintain strong relationships with residents and regulators.
 There were no capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental regulations applicable to our Oil and Gas Proppants operations during fiscal 2019, and we do not anticipate any such expenditures during fiscal 2020.
