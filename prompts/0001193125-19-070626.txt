Item 1. Business. 
Organization 
 NexPoint Capital, Inc. (the Company), which may also be referred to as we, us, or our, incorporated on September 30, 2013 (inception date) as a Delaware limited liability company. The Company is an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (BDC) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act). The Company is an investment company and accordingly follows the Investment Company accounting and reporting guidance under Topic 946 of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASBs) Accounting Standard Codification, as amended (ASC), Financial ServicesInvestment Companies. The Companys investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation primarily through investments in middle-market healthcare companies, middle-market companies in non-healthcare sectors, syndicated floating rate debt of large public and nonpublic companies and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). The Company has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (RIC) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) and intends each year to qualify and be treated as such. 
 The Company issued 21,739.13 LLC units to NexPoint Advisors, L.P., (the Adviser) on May 27, 2014 (initial fund raising date), at $9.20 per share for $200,000 in total proceeds. On June 10, 2014, the Company converted to a Delaware corporation, NexPoint Capital, Inc. As part of the conversion to a Delaware corporation, the member of the Company converted 21,739.13 LLC units into 21,739.13 shares of the Companys common stock, representing an equivalent price of $9.20 per share based on the fair value of the assets contributed by the Adviser in connection with the formation of the Company, as determined by the board of directors (the Board). 
 On September 2, 2014 (commencement of operations), in connection with a private placement of shares of our common stock to the Adviser and its affiliates, the Company issued an aggregate of approximately 1,086,954 shares of common stock at a price of $9.20 per share, which price represents the public offering price of $10.00 per share less selling commissions and dealer manager fees, for aggregate proceeds of approximately $10.0 million. 
 As a result of the private placement to the Adviser and its affiliates, the Company successfully satisfied the minimum offering requirement and officially commenced operations on September 2, 2014. In connection with the satisfaction of the minimum offering requirement and the commencement of our operations, the Investment Advisory Agreement became effective and the base investment advisory fee and any incentive fees, as applicable, payable to the Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement began to accrue. In aggregate as of December 31, 2018, the Adviser controls 2,310,880 total shares, including reinvestment of dividends, for a net amount of approximately $19.3 million. 
 The Company has retained the Adviser to manage certain aspects of its affairs on a day-to-day basis. Highland Capital Funds Distributor, Inc. (the Dealer Manager), an entity under common ownership with the Adviser, served as the dealer manager of the continuous public offering prior to the termination of the offering. The shares are being offered on a best efforts basis, which means generally that the Dealer Manager is required to use only its best efforts to sell the shares and it has no firm commitment or obligation to purchase any of the shares. The Adviser and Dealer Manager are related parties and will receive fees, distributions and other compensation for services related to the continuous public offering and the investment and management of the Companys assets. The Companys continuous public offering ended on February 28, 2018. 
 Overview of Our Business 
 Our investment activities are managed by the Adviser and supervised by the Board, of which a majority of the members are independent of the Company. 
 Our investment objective is to generate high current income and long-term capital appreciation. We seek to achieve our objective by using the experience of the healthcare, credit and structured products teams of Highland Capital Management, L.P. and its affiliates (Highland) to source, evaluate and structure investments, identify attractive investment opportunities that are primarily debt investments that generate high income without creating undue risk for the portfolio, make equity investments where we believe there will be attractive risk-adjusted returns that compensate for the lack of current income, and make investments in debt and equity tranches of CLOs that deliver income and high relative value. We will focus on companies that are stable, have positive cash flow, and the ability to grow their business model. 
 
1 


 Our investment policy is to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of our total assets in debt and equity of middle market companies, with an emphasis on healthcare companies, syndicated floating rate debt of large public and nonpublic companies, and mezzanine and equity tranches of CLOs. Middle-market companies include companies with annual revenues between $50 million and $2.5 billion and syndicated floating rate debt refers to loans and other instruments originated by a bank to a corporation that are sold off, or syndicated, to investors in pieces. We consider a healthcare company to be a company that is engaged in the design, development, production, sale, management or distribution of products, services or facilities used for or in connection with the healthcare industry. Additionally, we consider the term healthcare company to include companies that are materially impacted by the healthcare industry (such as a contractor that derives significant revenue or profit from the construction of hospitals). We may invest without limit in companies that are not in the healthcare sector. 
 We leverage the expertise of Highland with regard to distressed investing and restructuring to make opportunistic investments in distressed companies. We utilize the Highland credit underwriting capability to identify the types of companies we believe will provide high current income and/or long-term capital appreciation. In addition to the investments in the healthcare industry, we may invest a portion of our capital in other opportunistic investments in which the Adviser has expertise and where we believe an opportunity exists to achieve above-average risk-adjusted yields and returns. These types of opportunities may include: (1) direct lending or origination investments, (2) investments in stressed or distressed situations, (3) structured product investments, (4) equity investments and (5) other investment opportunities not typically available in other BDCs. Opportunistic investments may range from broadly syndicated deals to direct lending deals in both private and public companies and may include foreign investments. We believe this is the best approach to achieving our dual mandate of attempting to generate a high yield while also attempting to produce capital appreciation. 
 We seek to invest primarily in securities deemed by the Adviser to be high income generating debt investments and income generating equity securities of privately held companies in the United States. The portfolio may be concentrated primarily in senior floating rate debt securities, although we may invest without limit in securities that rank lower than senior secured instruments and may invest without limit in investments with a fixed rate of interest. We may buy syndicated loans, various tranches of CLOs and other debt instruments in the secondary market as well as originate debt so we can tailor the investment parameters more precisely to our needs. We also may invest a portion of the portfolio in equity securities that are non-income producing, when doing so will help us achieve our objective of long-term capital appreciation. We expect the size of our positions may range from $1 million to $20 million, although investments may be larger as our asset base increases. We may selectively make investments in amounts larger than $20 million in some of our portfolio companies. Prior to raising sufficient capital, we may make smaller investments. We may also invest without limitation in warrants and may also use derivatives, primarily swaps (including equity, variance and volatility swaps), options and futures contracts on securities, interest rates, commodities and/or currencies, as substitutes for direct investments the Company can make. We may also use derivatives such as swaps, options (including options on futures), futures, and foreign currency transactions (e.g., foreign currency swaps, futures and forwards) to any extent deemed by the Adviser to be in the best interest of the Company, and to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, to hedge various investments for risk management and speculative purposes. We may invest up to 15% of our net assets in entities that are excluded from registration under the 1940 Act by virtue of sections 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act (such as private equity funds or hedge funds). This limitation does not apply to any CLOs, certain of which may rely on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act. 
 We expect that many of the securities in which we invest will be rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities, which may be referred to as junk, have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, we expect that many of our debt investments will include floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically will not require the borrowers to pay down the outstanding principal of such debt prior to maturity. 
 As of December 31, 2018, our investment portfolio, with a total fair value of $96.2 million, consisted of 45 positions in portfolio companies (calculated as a percentage of total net assets: 9.7% in first lien senior secured loans, 5.0% in second lien senior secured loans, 0.0% in escrow loans, 4.0% in unsecured loans, 50.9% in corporate bonds, 1.1% in asset-backed securities, 1.4% in closed-end mutual funds, 0.1% in warrants, 22.9% in common stock, 4.9% in preferred stocks, and 0.0% in rights). As of December 31, 2018, including investments underlying the TRS with BNP Paribas on a look-through basis, the debt investments in our portfolio carry a weighted average cost price of 94.66% on par or stated value, as applicable, and our estimated gross annual portfolio yield (which represents the expected yield to be generated by us on our investment portfolio based on the composition of our portfolio as of such date), prior to leverage costs, was 6.92% based on the amortized cost of our investments. The portfolio yield does not represent an actual investment return to stockholders and does not include income from CLO equity.

 Recent Developments 
 On December 7, 2018, the board of directors (the Board) of NexPoint Capital, Inc. (the Company) declared a cash distribution of $0.06 per share of the Companys common stock, par value $0.001 per share, payable on January 30, 2019, to the stockholders of record on January 28, 2019, and A cash distribution of $0.06 per share of the Companys common stock, par value $0.001 per share, payable on February 27, 2019, to the stockholders of record on February 25, 2019. 
Business & Investment Strategies 
 We focus our healthcare investments primarily on opportunities in companies we believe will benefit from the long-term changes in the healthcare industry as a result of the aging demographic of Baby Boomers, implementation of payment system reforms and advances in medical technologies. It is our belief that the changing demographic landscape in the United States, where approximately 10,000 people per day turn 65 years of age, coupled with advances in medical technologies that are enabling Americans to live longer, will produce strong growth in demand for healthcare. At the same time, changes in the U.S. healthcare reimbursement system, including the implementation of value-based payment models and potential repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act (the ACA), are creating dramatic upheaval in the healthcare sector, affecting each sub-sector differently, and will produce a positive impact for some sub-sectors and a negative impact for others. We also believe some companies are better positioned to take advantage of these changes while others will consolidate with stronger players. Based on our deep understanding of the healthcare sector, we believe these developments will create a changing landscape for years to come. 
 Our primary areas of focus within the healthcare sector will be in the pharmaceuticals, devices, life sciences and facilities sub-sectors as we believe these will be the most significant beneficiaries of technological advances and the implementation of alternative payment models. We will also make opportunistic investments, including short sales, in other sub-sectors we believe will fare poorly during this period of transition. Although we believe the potential repeal and replacement of the ACA will create upheaval for the healthcare industry, we also believe this upheaval will create substantial opportunities for investors with a knowledge of how it will impact the industry. 
 However, the Adviser and its affiliates have a core competency in other, non-healthcare sectors, specifically in oil and gas and real estate, but also have vast experience investing in all economic sectors. When identifying potential middle-market investments for the portfolio, we focus on the attributes listed below. It is our belief that investments exhibiting these characteristics are the best investments to allow the Company to meet its investment objective with an acceptable level of risk. The attributes discussed below are general guidelines and not all investment opportunities may exhibit each of these qualities. Each investment opportunity is analyzed on a case-by-case basis by our investment professionals and the portfolio manager: 
 

 | Focus on growing economic sectorsWe seek companies that operate in or focus a substantial amount of their resources on economic sectors we believe will benefit from the current economic environment, including primarily the healthcare sector. Our view is that some sectors will be adversely impacted by rising rates while others will see tangible benefits. We think companies in our perceived winning sectors represent a better risk profile for our investments.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | High level of inherent value - We seek companies that have inherent value but need additional financing to implement their business plan fully and realize their full value. These businesses are typically smaller companies that cannot access traditional means of financing but have a solid business where additional investment of capital and economies of scale can unlock an outsized level of value. In some cases, we may take equity stakes in these businesses as well as debt positions to achieve our dual objectives of high current income and long-term capital appreciation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Strong risk/reward characteristicsWe seek investments where we believe we are compensated for the risk assumed. An investment opportunity may become more appealing if the terms of the investment are improved such as the interest rate, or if structural protections are added to decrease our perceived risk.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Proven management teamWe seek companies that have proven management teams that understand the impact the upcoming regulatory and interest rate environment will have on their business. We are not seeking investments in start-up companies or companies with unproven technologies or business models or companies with relatively inexperienced management. Our view is that it will take experienced, seasoned veterans to understand and navigate the pitfalls resulting from the Federal Reserves actions regarding interest rates and quantitative easing as well as a potentially increasing tax environment and changes to the economy from implementation of value-based payment models and potential repeal and replacement of the ACA. We believe these companies have a better chance of delivering value long-term to investors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | Strong cash flow and business models - We seek stable and proven businesses with strong cash flow that are able to adequately service their debt load. With an increase in interest rates, we believe financing will become more expensive and only companies with steady cash flow and business models will weather the storm. Businesses that have strong infrastructure, business models and processes will be better able to service their debt.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Stable and proven businesses - We seek companies that have a proven business model and strong strategic position within their industry. With the upheaval we believe will be evident in the next few years, we think growing a stable and proven business will be difficult enough. Trying to build out a new business model in a chaotic environment will be exponentially more difficult in our opinion and compensating for that level of risk will be difficult.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Potential Competitive Strengths 
 We believe the breadth, depth and experience of the Advisers senior management team, together with the extensive resources of Highlands investment team, provides a significant advantage in sourcing, analyzing, monitoring and managing investment opportunities. The Adviser and its affiliates have a large back office operations team that has years of experience in settling and tracking bank loan investments. The Adviser and its affiliates also have a dedicated team that operates registered funds, works with third party service providers, interacts with portfolio managers to provide timely information and portfolio statistics, and has experience interacting with legal counsel, auditors, other third party service providers and the Board. 
 We believe the long-term investment horizon we are afforded through the business development company structure will allow us flexibility to find the investments that will deliver the highest value to our investors. Unlike a typical private equity or venture fund, we are not required to return capital once a liquidity event is realized in an underlying investment. With the uncertainties inherent in the Federal Reserves actions regarding interest rates and quantitative easing and the potential repeal and replacement of the ACA, we believe it is difficult to make the best investment decisions if required to work under a finite time line. Because of the permanent capital vehicle structure, we believe we can offer an institutional-type strategy focused on the healthcare sector with institutional management capabilities to investors. 
 The Adviser and its affiliates have significant experience investing in the healthcare sector, across all sectors, all asset classes and in structured products. The Adviser and its affiliates investments have spanned the range from large capitalization companies that are publicly traded to small, privately held companies and to distressed companies that have been successfully turned around. We believe the Adviser and its affiliates expertise in underwriting credit across all sectors will give us an advantage in identifying and investing in the best middle-market companies in direct lending situations, syndicated loans and CLOs. 
 The Adviser and its affiliates credit platform has been through many credit cycles, and the Adviser and its affiliates remain a recognized leader in the credit space, winning numerous industry awards and recognition from peers. The Adviser and its affiliates have a proprietary credit underwriting process and maintain coverage of many public and non-public companies across all sectors. Investments are reviewed by the analyst team and approved by a credit committee that meets daily. The process includes on-going monitoring of all investments. Highland and its affiliates have a team of 7 investment professionals dedicated to the healthcare sector. 
 Investment Criteria/Guidelines 
 We believe there are currently, and will continue to be, significant investment opportunities in middle-market companies and larger private companies, particularly in the healthcare sector and particularly in income producing securities, in the United States. Additionally, we believe there continues to be attractive investment opportunities in the syndicated floating rate debt and CLO markets. 
 Target businesses will typically exhibit some or all of the following characteristics: 
 

 | exposure to healthcare sub-sectors we believe will benefit from implementation of alternative payment models;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | exposure to non-healthcare sub-sectors we believe will benefit from a rising interest rate environment and the Federal Reserves policies in response to rising rates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a U.S. base of operations;
--+---------------------------


 | an experienced management team executing a long-term growth strategy;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
4 


 
 | discernable downside protection through recurring revenue or strong tangible asset coverage;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | defensible niche product/service;
--+----------------------------------


 | products and services with distinctive competitive advantages or other barriers to entry;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | stable and predictable free cash flows;
--+----------------------------------------


 | existing indebtedness that may be refinanced on attractive terms;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | low technology and market risk;
--+--------------------------------


 | strong customer relationships; and
--+-----------------------------------


 | low to moderate capital expenditure requirements.
--+--------------------------------------------------

 We expect that deal flow and idea generation for investments will primarily originate from the Adviser and its affiliates existing and extensive network of informal and unconventional deal sources in the middle-market business community. Once potential investments have been identified, we, through our investment adviser, will conduct a rigorous due diligence process that draws from our investment advisers investment experience, industry expertise and network of contacts. Our investment adviser will then work with outside counsel to structure loans with strong creditor protections and contractual controls over borrower operations. Our investment adviser will work to obtain extensive operating and financial covenants, detailed reporting requirements, governance rights and board seats to protect our investment while allowing the borrower the necessary flexibility to successfully execute its business plan. We will actively monitor and manage our portfolio with regard to individual company performance as well as general market conditions. Investment decisions on new originations generally will include an analysis of the impact of the new loan on our broader portfolio, including a top-down assessment of portfolio structure and risk exposure. 
 Investments in Middle-Market Healthcare Companies 
 Our portfolio of middle-market investments will have a focus on companies in the healthcare sector as we believe there is a large and growing investment opportunity in this sector. Changes in the U.S. healthcare reimbursement system, including the implementation of value-based payment models and potential repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, are creating a dramatic upheaval in the healthcare sector, affecting each sub-sector differently, and will produce a positive impact for some sub-sectors and a negative impact for others. 
 We believe some companies are better positioned to take advantage of these changes while others will consolidate with stronger players. Based on our deep understanding of the healthcare sector, we believe these developments will create a changing landscape for years to come. 
 Healthcare is a defensive and stable sector that has experienced out-sized growth and consistency during the past four decades. There are three primary growth drivers of healthcare: (1) demographics, (2) price inflation and (3) per-person utilization of care. The historical demographic growth rate has been 1.00%%. Price inflation in healthcare has added an additional 5.64%, almost double the baseline U.S. GDP growth rate since 1970 of 2.79%. Per-person utilization is a function of access to health insurance as well as aging demographics. In the past three decades, the population above age 90 has tripled and is expected to quadruple over the next three decades. Due to these drivers, healthcare has moved from 3% of GDP in 1980 to approximately 18% today and is expected to continue to grow. 
 Investments in Middle-Market Non-Healthcare Companies 
 Since 2009, credit market conditions have improved as stability has returned to the U.S. financial system. The Federal Reserve instituted a zero interest rate policy and has been successful in keeping rates low across the yield curve. As a result, investor and business confidence has returned and the economy and employment have been growing, although slower than pre-2008. Despite the improvement, growth and employment remain sluggish. Despite these headwinds, we believe the healthcare sector continues to flourish. We believe that as interest rates rise, financing for middle-market companies in all sectors will become more difficult. The capital requirements of business in many sectors will be enormous in the coming years. These companies will, in our opinion, turn more and more to specialty finance vehicles, such as us, to procure the capital they need for growth. We view the financing of middle-market companies to be an underserved area, presenting enormous opportunities. 
 
5 


 The U.S. Census Bureau statistics from its economic census in 2007 indicate there are over 40,000 U.S. businesses classified as middle-market (annual revenues between $50 million and $2.5 billion) while there are approximately only 1,200 companies with annual revenues in excess of $2.5 billion. We believe middle-market companies represent an outsized potential for growth compared to larger companies. Additionally, these companies require large amounts of capital to grow their businesses but have limited access to more traditional capital providers. Despite the size of the market, there are few providers of financing for middle-market companies. Underwriting credit to a private company requires more diligence and a specific skill set that large financial institutions typically do not possess and requires more time than they are willing to invest. It is this lack of access and competition that drives the opportunity, as it should allow us to pick the best companies and negotiate more favorable terms. 
 As a large percentage of our investments are expected to be in the form of floating rate debt, we will be able to create a portfolio of middle-market companies that we believe will have an increasing income stream over time, particularly as interest rates increase above their historic lows. Also, as floating rate debt reduces the interest rate risk inherent in longer duration credit instruments, we can build a portfolio that has mostly credit risk, which we believe the Adviser and its affiliates have significant experience at assessing. 
 Investments in Large Syndicated Floating Rate Debt 
 A large portion of the investments we make in middle-market companies are expected to be in the form of floating rate instruments. Also, a portion of the portfolio will be invested in large syndicated floating rate debt of non-public and public companies. Syndicated floating rate debts are loans originated by a bank to a corporation that are sold off, or syndicated, to investors in pieces. Floating rate loans have a base rate that adjusts periodically plus a spread over the base rate. The base rate is typically the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, and resets every 90 days. With rates resetting in an environment where the prevailing base rate is increasing, the income stream from a floating rate instrument will increase. Syndicated floating rate debt offers certain benefits: 
 High current income. Historically, floating rate loans have lower yields than high yield bonds, due in part to better credit and interest-rate risk profile, but still offer an attractive risk-reward income dynamic. However, today floating rate yields are comparable to high-yield bonds. 
 Adjustable coupon payment. Floating rate loans are structured so that interest rates reset on a predetermined schedule. When interest rates rise, coupon payments increase, and vice versa, with little lag time (typically 90 days or less). This feature greatly reduces the interest rate, or duration, risk inherent in high yield bonds, which typically never reset. Therefore, as rates rise, the value of a high yield bond should decline while the value of a floating rate loan should remain stable. 
 Priority in event of default. In the event of a default, floating rate loans typically have a higher position in a companys capital structure, have first claim to assets and greater covenant protection than high yield bonds. As a result, floating rate loans have generally recovered a greater percentage of value than high yield bonds. Also, the default rate for floating rate loans has historically been lower than defaults of high yield bonds. 
 Reduced Volatility. The return of floating rate loans has historically had a low correlation to most asset classes and a negative correlation with some asset classes. Therefore, adding floating rate loans to a portfolio should reduce volatility and risk. 
 In our view, an allocation to large syndicated floating rate debt provides stable value with high current income and offers the portfolio liquidity. 
 Investments in CLOs 
 We view CLOs as an excellent way to gain exposure to syndicated floating rate debt at a less expensive price and higher yield with greater upside potential for capital appreciation while minimizing interest rate risk. CLO vehicles are entities formed to manage a portfolio of syndicated bank loans. The CLO vehicle raises capital by issuing equity and multiple tranches of debt and uses the proceeds to buy the underlying portfolio of syndicated bank loans. The syndicated bank loans the CLO is allowed to purchase is limited by criteria established within the documents governing the CLO. The CLO also has certain priority of payment provisions or waterfall provisions that benefit the higher rated debt tranches. Documents governing CLOs typically provide for adjustments to the waterfall in the event certain tests are triggered, diverting cash to the higher rated debt tranches. 
 Investment Process Overview 
 Sourcing. We believe that identifying middle-market companies that represent attractive debt investment opportunities requires a different sourcing network than is required for investments in larger companies. Whereas larger companies typically hire an investment bank to help develop marketing materials and run a financing process involving a large number of potential lenders to ensure pricing is determined by the market, middle-market companies typically do not have the resources to hire large financial advisers or investment banks. While these lending opportunities are far less competitive, they are more difficult to source.

 We expect that deal flow and idea generation for investments will primarily originate from the Adviser and its affiliates existing and extensive network of informal and unconventional deal sources in the middle-market business community. Built over 20 years, this deal sourcing network includes accountants, attorneys, bankers, brokers, insurance agents, consultants, private equity firms and financial advisers who have access to small-cap companies. Additionally, we have forged contacts specific to the healthcare and energy industry that includes all sub-sectors, as well as other sectors. 
 The contacts in the Advisers network generally operate outside of the established investment banking infrastructure and typically play a limited introductory role to companies and their management teams. In addition, the Adviser promotes a culture in which sourcing is considered a focus for all of its investment professionals. 
 Due Diligence. We believe it is critical to conduct extensive due diligence on investment targets, and in evaluating new investments. We, through our investment adviser, will conduct a rigorous due diligence process that draws from our investment advisers investment experience, industry expertise and network of contacts. Our investment adviser intends to conduct extensive due diligence and perform thorough credit analysis on each potential portfolio company investment. In conducting due diligence, we expect that our investment adviser will use publicly available information and private information provided by borrowers, their financial sponsors and their advisers. Our investment adviser expects to use its relationships with former and current management teams, consultants, competitors, bankers, private equity firms and investment bankers to gain further insights into businesses and industries, generally, and our potential portfolio companies, specifically. 
 Our due diligence will typically include the following elements (although not all elements will necessarily form part of each due diligence review): 
 

 | thorough review of historical and pro forma financial information, including an analysis of collateral coverage, cash flow and valuation multiples and quality of earnings;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | review of capital structure, including leverage and equity amounts, participants and intercreditor arrangements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | analysis of the business of the prospective portfolio company, including drivers of growth, customer and supplier concentrations, fixed versus variable costs and sensitivity analyses (with a focus on downside scenario analysis);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | analysis of the industry in which the prospective portfolio company operates, including its competitive position, industry size and growth rates, competitive outlook, barriers to entry, and technological, regulatory and similar considerations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | interviews with management, employees, customers and vendors and analysis of managements track record, quality, breadth and depth;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | anticipated form of any potential restructuring, potential liquidation value and potential for collateral impairment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | preparation or review of material contracts and loan documents;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | anticipated timing of covenant breaches and default cure provisions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


 | research relating to the companys business, industry, markets, products and services;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | background checks on key managers when appropriate; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


 | third-party research relating to the companys management, industry, markets, products and services and competitors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additional due diligence with respect to any investment may be conducted on our behalf by attorneys and independent accountants as well as other outside advisers, as appropriate. 
 Structuring Originations. Our investment advisers team has substantial expertise in structuring and documenting loans originated to middle-market companies. Our investment adviser works with outside counsel to structure loans with strong creditor protections and contractual controls over borrower operations. Our investment adviser works to obtain extensive operating and financial covenants, detailed reporting requirements, governance rights and board seats to protect our investment while allowing the borrower the necessary flexibility to successfully execute its business plan. We believe that our investment advisers extensive experience allows it to anticipate issues and maximize our potential recovery upon the occurrence of adverse events, and our investment adviser is able to seek to structure our loan and credit documentation to protect us from risks identified in the due diligence process. Our investment adviser also evaluates the broader capital structure of the borrower to ensure that we have strong rights as compared to other participants in the borrowers capital structure. 
 Portfolio Management and Monitoring. We actively monitor and manage our portfolio with regard to individual company performance as well as general market conditions. Investment decisions on new originations generally include an analysis of the impact of the new loan on our broader portfolio, including a top-down assessment of portfolio structure and risk exposure. This assessment includes a review of portfolio concentration by issuer, industry, geography and type of credit as well as an evaluation of our portfolios exposure to macroeconomic factors and cyclical trends. 
 
7 


 We believe that consistent, active monitoring of individual companies and the broader market is integral to portfolio management and a critical component of our investment process. Our investment adviser uses several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, including the following: 
 

 | frequent discussions with management and sponsors, including board observation rights where possible;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | comparing/analyzing financial performance to the portfolio companys business plan, as well as our internal projections developed at underwriting;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | tracking portfolio company compliance with covenants, as well as other metrics identified at the initial investment stage, such as acquisitions, divestitures, product development and specified management hires; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | periodic review of each asset in the portfolio and more rigorous monitoring of watch list positions.

 Our primary competitors to provide financing to middle-market companies include public and private funds, including other business development companies, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies, and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. As the economic recovery continues, we expect that we may face enhanced competition in the future. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act will impose on us as a business development company and that the Code will impose on us as a RIC. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see Risk FactorsRisks Relating to our Business and StructureThe highly competitive market for investment opportunities in which we operate may limit our investment opportunities. 
Administration 
 We do not have any direct employees, and our day-to-day investment operations are managed by our investment adviser. Our officers will be employees of the Adviser. Some of our executive officers described under Management of the Company are also officers of the Adviser. See The Adviser and the AdministratorAdministration Agreement. 
Regulation 
 We have filed an election to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act and to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and intend each year to qualify and be eligible to be treated as such. As a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between business development companies and their affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors of a business development company be persons other than interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a business development company unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 
 We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an underwriter as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies, except that we may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations to the extent that we are permitted to engage in such hedging transactions without registering with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a commodity pool operator. However, we may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investments. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We also do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any registered investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one

  investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of investment companies in the aggregate. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. None of these policies is fundamental and each may be changed without stockholder approval. 
 To the extent that we utilize a REIT subsidiary that directly incurs leverage in the form of debt (as opposed to non-recourse borrowings made through special purpose vehicles), the amount of such recourse leverage used by us will be consolidated and treated as senior securities for purposes of complying with the 1940 Acts limitations on leverage. Accordingly, it is our present intention to utilize leverage through debt or borrowings in an amount not to exceed 50% of our total assets (i.e., to maintain 200% asset coverage), less the amount of any nonrecourse direct debt or borrowing by a REIT subsidiary, if any. Because a REIT subsidiarys preferred shares would represent a small amount of leverage by the REIT subsidiary, such leverage will also be consolidated for purposes of complying with the 1940 Acts limitations on our ability to issue preferred shares. 
 Qualifying Assets 
 Under the 1940 Act, a business development company may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the companys total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our proposed business are the following: 

1. | Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


a. | is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b. | is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the business development company) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c. | satisfies any of the following:
---+--------------------------------


i. | does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or has any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange subject to a $250 million market capitalization maximum; or
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ii. | is controlled by a business development company or a group of companies including a business development company, the business development company actually exercises controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible portfolio company, and, as a result, the business development company has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The regulations defining and interpreting qualifying assets may change over time. We expect to adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area.

 Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 
 In addition, a business development company must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the business development company must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance. When a business development company purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means any arrangement whereby the business development company, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. As our administrator, the Adviser has agreed to provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. We may receive fees for these services and will reimburse the Adviser for the actual costs incurred in providing managerial assistance on our behalf, subject to the review and approval by the Board, including our independent directors. 
Temporary Investments 
 Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, so long as such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. Government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. Our investment adviser intends to monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 
Senior Securities 
 We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. 
 We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see Risk FactorsRisks Relating to our Business and StructureRegulations governing our operation as a business development company will affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional debt or equity capital. 
 Code of Ethics 
 We and the Adviser have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the codes requirements. You may read and copy the code of ethics at the SECs Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at (202) 551-8090. In addition, each code of ethics is attached as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, and is available on the EDGAR Database on the SECs Internet site at http://www.sec.gov. You may also obtain copies of each code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following Email address: publicinfo@sec.gov, or by writing the SECs Public Reference Section, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. 
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 
 We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our investment adviser. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of our investment adviser are described below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by our investment adviser and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. For purposes of these Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures described below, we our and us refers to our investment adviser. 
 
10 


 Introduction 
 As an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (Advisers Act), we have a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of our clients. As part of this duty, we recognize that we must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of our clients. 
 These policies and procedures for voting proxies for our investment Advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under the Advisers Act. 
 Proxy Policies 
 We vote proxies relating to our clients portfolio securities in what we perceive to be the best interest of our clients stockholders. We review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by our clients. In most cases, we will vote in favor of proposals that we believe are likely to increase the value of our clients portfolio securities. Although we will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our clients portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so. 
 Our proxy voting decisions are made by the senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of clients investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. Where conflicts of interest may be present, we will disclose such conflicts, including to us, and may request guidance on how to vote such proxies. 
 Proxy Voting Records 
 You may obtain information without charge about how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Investor Relations, 300 Crescent Court, Suite 700, Dallas, Texas 75201, or by calling us collect at (844) 485-9167.Privacy Principles 
 We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 
 Generally, we do not receive any non-public personal information relating to our stockholders. The only information we collect from you is your name, address, number of shares you hold and your social security number. This information is used only so that we can send you annual reports and other information about us, and send you proxy statements or other information required by law. We will maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the non-public personal information of our stockholders. We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone except as described below. 
 

 | Authorized Employees of the Adviser and Its Affiliates. It is our policy that only authorized employees of the Adviser and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information will have access to it.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Service Providers. We may disclose your personal information to companies that provide services on our behalf, such as record keeping, processing your trades, and mailing you information. These companies are required to protect your information and use it solely for the purpose for which they received it.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Courts and Government Officials. If required by law, we may disclose your personal information in accordance with a court order or at the request of government regulators. Only that information required by law, subpoena, or court order will be disclosed.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Other 
 We are prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our independent directors and, in some cases, of the SEC. Any person that owns, directly or indirectly, five percent or more of our outstanding voting securities will be our affiliate for purposes of the 1940 Act, and we are generally prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to, or entering into certain joint transactions (which could include investments in the same portfolio company) with such affiliates, absent the prior approval of our independent directors and/or appropriate exemptive relief. Our investment adviser and its affiliates, including persons that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with, us or our investment adviser, are also considered to be our affiliates under the 1940 Act, and we are generally prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to, or entering into joint transactions with such affiliates without the prior approval of our independent directors and, in some cases, exemptive relief from the SEC. 
 We may, however, invest alongside the Advisers, and its affiliates other clients in certain circumstances where doing so is consistent with applicable law and SEC staff interpretations and specific exemptive relief from the SEC. For example, we may invest alongside such accounts consistent with guidance promulgated by the staff of the SEC permitting us and such other accounts to purchase interests in a single class of privately placed securities so long as certain conditions are met, including that our investment adviser, acting on our behalf and on behalf of other clients, negotiates no term other than price. We, Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors L.P. and the Adviser have obtained an exemptive order dated April 19, 2016 from the SEC to permit co-investments among the Company and other accounts managed by the Adviser or its affiliates, subject to certain conditions. We may also invest alongside our investment advisers other clients as otherwise permissible under regulatory guidance, applicable regulations and the allocation policy of our investment adviser and its affiliates (including clients that may pay higher fees to NexPoint Advisors or its affiliates or in which our portfolio managers have personal interest in the receipt of such fess). If sufficient securities or loan amounts are available to satisfy our and each such accounts proposed demand, we expect that the opportunity will be allocated in accordance with our investment advisers pre-transaction determination. Where there is an insufficient amount of an investment opportunity to satisfy us and other accounts sponsored or managed by our investment adviser or its affiliates, the allocation policy further provides that allocations among us and such other accounts will generally be made pro rata, based on the amount that each such party would have invested if sufficient securities or loan amounts were available. The allocation policies and procedures are intended to assist NexPoint Advisors and its affiliates in ensuring that investment opportunities will be allocated to us fairly and equitably. 
 We will be subject to periodic examination by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a business development company, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such persons office. 
 We and the Adviser will each be required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the U.S. federal securities laws, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. 
 We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below current net asset value per share. We may, however, issue and sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value per share of our common stock if the Board determines that such sale is in the best interests of us and our stockholders, and if our stockholders approve such sale within the preceding 12 months. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price that, in the determination of the Board, closely approximates the fair value of such securities. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements will affect us. For example: 
 

 | pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
12 


 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated under it. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance with that act. 
 Brokerage Allocation and Other Practices 
 Since we intend to generally acquire and dispose of our investments in privately negotiated transactions, we expect to infrequently use brokers in the normal course of our business. Subject to policies established by the Board, the Adviser will be primarily responsible for the execution of the publicly traded securities portion of our portfolio transactions and the allocation of brokerage commissions. The Adviser does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to obtain the best net results for us, considering such factors as (i) price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), (ii) size of the order, (iii) difficulty of execution, (iv) operational facilities of the firm, (v) promptness of execution and past history in executing orders, (vi) clearance and settlement capabilities, (vii) research capabilities, (viii) access to markets and distribution network, (ix) the firms risk and skill in positioning blocks of securities and (x) trade error rate and ability or willingness to correct errors. While the Adviser will generally seek reasonably competitive trade execution costs, we will not necessarily pay the lowest spread or commission available. Subject to applicable legal requirements, the Adviser may select a broker based partly upon brokerage, research or other services provided to it and us and any other clients. In return for such services, we may pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if the Adviser determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided. 
Tax Matters 
 The following is a general summary of some of the important U.S. federal income tax considerations affecting us and our common shareholders that are United States persons within the meaning of the Code, and does not address any state, local, foreign or other tax consequences. It reflects provisions of the Code, existing Treasury regulations, and other applicable authority, as of the date of this prospectus. These authorities may be changed, possibly with retroactive effect, or subject to new legislative, administrative, or judicial interpretations. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to our common shareholders. For example, except as otherwise specifically noted herein, we have not described certain tax considerations that may be relevant to certain types of holders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including shareholders subject to the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, pension plans and trusts, RICs, dealers in securities, shareholders holding our shares through tax-advantaged accounts (such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts), financial institutions, shareholders holding our shares as part of a hedge, straddle, or conversion transaction, entities that are not organized under the laws of the United States or a political subdivision thereof, and persons who are neither citizens nor residents of the United States. This summary assumes that investors hold our common shares as capital assets (within the meaning of the Code). Please consult your tax advisor about U.S. federal, state, local, foreign or other tax laws applicable to you, as the tax consequences to an investor in our common shares will depend on the facts of his, her or its particular situation. 
 Taxation of the Company 
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and intend each year to qualify and to be eligible to be treated as such. 
 In order to qualify for the special tax treatment accorded RICs and their shareholders, we must, among other things: 
 

(i) | derive at least 90% of our gross income for each taxable year from: (a) dividends, interest (including tax-exempt interest), payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, or other income (including but not limited to gains from options, futures and forward contracts) derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock, securities or foreign currencies; and (b) net income derived from interests in qualified publicly traded partnerships;
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | diversify our holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of our taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of our total assets consists of cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, the securities of other RICs and other securities limited, in respect of any one issuer, to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of our total assets and not more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the value of our total assets is
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
13 


 
invested, including through corporations in which we own a 20% or more voting stock interest, (x) in the securities (other than U.S. government securities and the securities of other RICs) of any one issuer or of two or more issuers that we control, as determined under applicable Code rules, and that are determined to be engaged in the same business or similar or related trades or businesses, or (y) in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships; and
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | distribute to our shareholders with respect to each taxable year at least 90% of the sum of our investment company taxable income (as that term is defined in the Code, without regard to the deduction for dividends paidgenerally taxable ordinary income and the excess, if any, of net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses) and any net tax-exempt interest income (the excess of our gross tax-exempt interest over certain disallowed deductions), for such year, in a manner qualifying for the dividends paid deduction.
------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If we qualify as a RIC (i.e., satisfy the source of income and diversification requirements described in (i) and (ii) above) and satisfy the annual distribution requirement described in (iii) above, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on income distributed in a timely manner to our shareholders in the form of dividends (including Capital Gain Dividends, as defined below). If we were not a publicly offered RIC within the meaning of Code Section 67(c)(2)(B) for any year, such status would potentially render distributions to our shareholders non-deductible by virtue of the terms of our distribution reinvestment plan, which would bear adversely on our ability to satisfy the foregoing distribution requirements to qualify as a RIC accorded special tax treatment for such year. 
 If, for any taxable year, we were to fail to meet the income, diversification or distribution tests described above, we could in some cases cure such failure, including by paying a corporate-level tax, paying interest, making additional distributions or disposing of certain assets. If we were ineligible to or otherwise did not cure any such failure for any year, or if we were otherwise to fail to qualify as a RIC accorded special tax treatment for such year, we would be subject to tax on our taxable income at corporate rates, and all distributions from earnings and profits, including any distributions of net long-term capital gains, would be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income. Some portions of such distributions might be eligible for the dividends-received deduction in the case of corporate shareholders and might be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income and thus taxable at the lower long-term capital gain rate in the case of shareholders taxed at individual rates, provided, in both cases, the shareholder met certain holding period and other requirements in respect of our shares (as described below). In addition, we might be required to recognize unrealized gains, pay substantial taxes and interest and make substantial distributions before requalifying as a RIC. 
 We intend to distribute at least annually to our shareholders all or substantially all of our investment company taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction) and, in general, our net capital gain (that is, the excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss, in each case determined with reference to any loss carryforwards). Any investment company taxable income we retain will be subject to a corporate-level tax at regular corporate rates. We may also retain for investment our net capital gain. If we retain any net capital gain, it will be subject to corporate-level tax at regular corporate rates on the amount retained, but we may designate the retained amount as undistributed capital gains in a timely notice to our shareholders who would then, in turn, be (i) required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain, their shares of such undistributed amount, and (ii) entitled to credit their proportionate shares of the tax we paid on such undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds on a properly-filed U.S. tax return to the extent the credit exceeds such liabilities. If we make this designation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax basis of shares owned by one of our shareholders would be increased by an amount equal to the difference between the amount of undistributed capital gains included in the shareholders gross income under clause (i) of the preceding sentence and the tax deemed paid by the shareholder under clause (ii) of the preceding sentence. We are not required to, and there can be no assurance we will, make this designation if we retain all or a portion of our net capital gain in a taxable year. 
 In determining its net capital gain, including in connection with determining the amount available to support a Capital Gain Dividend (as defined below), its taxable income, and its earnings and profits, a RIC generally may elect to treat part or all of any post-October capital loss (defined as any net capital loss attributable to the portion of the taxable year after October 31 or, if there is no such loss, the net long-term capital loss or net short-term capital loss attributable to such portion of the taxable year) or late-year ordinary loss (generally, the sum of its net ordinary loss from the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of property, attributable to the portion of the taxable year after October 31, as if incurred in the succeeding taxable year. 
 If in a calendar year we fail to distribute at least an amount equal to the sum of 98% of our ordinary income for such year and 98.2% of our capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending on October 31 of such year (unless an election is made to use our taxable year), plus any such undistributed amounts from the prior year, we will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax on the undistributed amounts. For purposes of the required excise tax distribution, a RICs ordinary gains and losses from the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of property that would otherwise be taken into account after October 31 of a calendar year generally (unless an election is made to use our taxable year) are treated as arising on January 1 of the following calendar year. Also, for these purposes, we will be treated as having distributed any amount on which we have been subject to corporate income tax in the taxable year ending with the calendar year. We reserve the right to pay the excise tax when circumstances warrant. 
 
14 


 We are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain asset coverage tests are met. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our qualification as a RIC, including the diversification test described above. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the distribution test described above or to avoid the excise tax on undistributed amounts, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 
 We are not permitted to deduct capital losses in excess of capital gains (net capital losses) against our net investment income. Instead, potentially subject to certain limitations, we may carry net capital losses from any taxable year forward to subsequent taxable years to offset capital gains, if any, realized during such subsequent taxable year. Capital loss carryforwards are reduced to the extent they offset current-year net realized capital gains, whether we retain or distribute such gains. Net capital losses will be carried forward to one or more subsequent taxable years without expiration to offset capital gains realized during such subsequent taxable years; any such carryforward losses will retain their character as short-term or long-term. 
 Our ability to use net capital losses may be limited following the occurrence of certain (i) acquisitive reorganizations and (ii) shifts in the ownership of our shares by a shareholder owning or treated as owning 5% or more of our shares (each, an ownership change). The Code may similarly limit our ability to use any of our other capital losses, or ordinary losses, that have accrued but have not been recognized (i.e., built-in losses) at the time of an ownership change to the extent they are realized within the five-year period following the ownership change. 
 Distributions to Shareholders 
 Distributions not in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits are taxable to shareholders even if we paid them from income or gains we earned before a shareholder invested in our shares (and such income and gains thus were included in the price the shareholder paid for its shares). Such distributions are taxable whether shareholders receive them in cash or reinvest them in additional shares through our distribution reinvestment plan. A shareholder who reinvests such distributions in shares through our distribution reinvestment plan will be treated as having received a dividend equal to the fair market value of the new shares issued to the shareholder. 
 Dividends and other distributions we pay are generally treated under the Code as received by shareholders at the time the dividend or distribution is made. However, a dividend paid to shareholders in January of a year generally is deemed to have been paid by us on December 31 of the preceding year, if the dividend was declared and payable to shareholders of record on a date in October, November or December of that preceding year. 
 The price of common shares purchased at any time may reflect the amount of a forthcoming distribution. If you purchase common shares just prior to a distribution, you will receive a distribution that will be taxable to you even though it economically represents in part a return of your invested capital. 
 Your broker or other intermediary will send you information after the end of each year setting forth the amount and tax status of any dividends or other distributions we pay to you. 
 For U.S. federal income tax purposes, distributions of investment income are generally taxable as ordinary income. Taxes on distributions of capital gains are determined by how long we have owned or are treated as having owned the investments that generated them, rather than how long a shareholder has owned his or her shares. In general, we will recognize long-term capital gain or loss on investments we have owned (or are deemed to have owned) for more than one year, and short-term capital gain or loss on investments we have owned (or are deemed to have owned) for one year or less. Distributions of net capital gain that we properly report as capital gain dividends (Capital Gain Dividends) will generally be taxable to shareholders as long-term capital gains. Distributions from capital gains are generally made after applying any available capital loss carryforwards. Distributions of net short-term capital gain (that is, the excess of net short-term capital gain over net long-term capital loss) will generally be taxable to shareholders receiving such distributions as ordinary income. Distributions of investment income we report as derived from qualified dividend income will be taxed in the hands of individuals at the rates applicable to long-term capital gain, provided holding period and other requirements are met at both the shareholder and corporate level. We do not expect a significant portion of our distributions to be derived from qualified dividend income. 
 In order for some portion of the dividends received by one of our shareholders to be qualified dividend income, we must meet holding period and other requirements with respect to some portion of the dividend-paying stocks in our portfolio and the shareholder must meet holding period and other requirements with respect to our shares. In general, a dividend will not be treated as qualified dividend income (at either the corporate or shareholder level) (1) if the dividend is received with respect to any share of 
 
15 


  stock held for fewer than 61 days during the 121-day period beginning on the date which is 60 days before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend (or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date), (2) to the extent that the recipient is under an obligation (whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property, (3) if the recipient elects to have the dividend income treated as investment income for purposes of the limitation on deductibility of investment interest, or (4) if the dividend is received from a foreign corporation that is (a) not eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States (with the exception of dividends paid on stock of such a foreign corporation readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States) or (b) treated as a passive foreign investment company. 
 In general, distributions of investment income we designate as derived from qualified dividend income will be treated as qualified dividend income by a shareholder taxed at individual rates, provided the shareholder meets the holding period and other requirements described in the paragraph immediately above with respect to our shares. We do not expect a significant portion of our distributions to constitute qualified dividend income. 
 In general, dividends of net investment income received by our corporate shareholders will qualify for the dividends-received deduction generally available to corporations to the extent of the amount of eligible dividends we receive from domestic corporations for the taxable year. A dividend we receive will not be treated as a qualifying dividend (i) if it has been received with respect to any share of stock that we have held for less than 46 days (91 days in the case of certain preferred stock) during the 91-day period beginning on the date which is 45 days before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend (during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date in the case of certain preferred stock) or (ii) to the extent that we are under an obligation (pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property. Moreover, the dividends-received deduction may be disallowed or reduced (i) if the corporate shareholder fails to satisfy the foregoing requirements with respect to our shares or (ii) by application of various provisions of the Code (for instance, the dividends-received deduction is reduced in the case of a dividend received on debt-financed portfolio stock (generally, stock acquired with borrowed funds)). We do not expect a significant portion of our distributions to be eligible for this corporate dividends-received deduction. 
 Any distribution of income that is attributable to (i) income we receive in lieu of dividends with respect to securities on loan pursuant to a securities lending transaction or (ii) dividend income we receive on securities we temporarily purchased from a counterparty pursuant to a repurchase agreement under which for U.S. federal income tax purposes we are treated as a lender, such distribution will not constitute qualified dividend income to individual shareholders and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction for corporate shareholders. 
 Subject to any future regulatory guidance to the contrary, any distribution of income attributable to qualified real estate investment trust (REIT) dividends from our investment in a REIT, as applicable, will ostensibly not qualify for the deduction that would be available to a non-corporate shareholder were the shareholder to own such REIT directly. 
 The Code generally imposes a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on the net investment income of certain individuals, estates and trusts to the extent their income exceeds certain amounts. Net investment income generally includes for this purpose dividends we pay, including any capital gain dividends and net capital gains recognized on the sale or exchange of our shares. Shareholders are advised to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this additional tax on their investment with us. 
 If for any taxable year we were not a publicly offered RIC within the meaning of Code Section 67(c)(2)(B), certain of our direct and indirect expenses, including the management fee, the incentive fee and certain other advisory expenses, would be subject to special pass-through rules. Such rules would treat these expenses as additional dividends to certain of our direct or indirect shareholders (generally including other RICs that are not publicly offered, individuals and entities that compute their taxable income in the same manner as an individual) and, under current law, are not deductible by those shareholders that are individuals (or entities that compute their taxable income in the same manner as an individual). 
 Return of Capital Distributions 
 If, for any taxable year, our total distributions exceed both current and accumulated earnings and profits, the excess will generally be treated as a tax-free return of capital up to the amount of your tax basis in our shares. The amount treated as a tax-free return of capital will reduce your tax basis in our shares, thereby increasing your potential gain or reducing your potential loss on the subsequent sale of our shares. Any amounts distributed to you in excess of your tax basis in our shares will be taxable to you as capital gain. 
 
16 


 Distributions we pay with respect to our shares are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax as described herein to the extent they do not exceed our realized income and gains, even though such dividends and distributions may economically represent a return of a particular shareholders investment. Such distributions are likely to occur in respect of shares purchased at a time when our net asset value reflects either unrealized gains, or realized but undistributed income or gains, that were therefore included in the price the shareholder paid. Such distributions may reduce the value of our shares below the shareholders cost basis in those shares. As described above, we are required to distribute realized income and gains regardless of whether our net asset value also reflects unrealized losses. 
 Tax Implications of Certain Investments 
 Some debt obligations with a fixed maturity date of more than one year from the date of issuance that we acquire in the secondary market may be treated as having market discount. Very generally, market discount is the excess of the stated redemption price of a debt obligation (or in the case of an obligation issued with OID (as defined below), its revised issue price) over the purchase price of such obligation. Subject to the discussion below regarding Section 451 of the Code, generally, any gain recognized on the disposition of, and any partial payment of principal on, a debt obligation having market discount is treated as ordinary income to the extent the gain, or principal payment, does not exceed the accrued market discount on such debt obligation. Alternatively, a holder may elect to accrue market discount currently. As of the date of this prospectus, we have made this election, and therefore we are required to include currently any accrued market discount on such debt obligations in our taxable income (as ordinary income) and thus distribute it over the terms of the obligations, even though payment of those amounts is not received until a later time, upon partial or full repayment or disposition of the applicable debt obligations. We reserve the right to revoke this election at any time pursuant to applicable IRS procedures. The rate at which market discount accrues, and thus is included in our income, will depend upon which of the permitted accrual methods we elect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective for taxable years beginning after 2017, Section 451 of the Code generally requires any accrual method taxpayer to take into account items of gross income no later than the time at which such items are taken into account as revenue in the taxpayers financial statements. The application of Section 451 to the accrual of market discount is currently unclear. If Section 451 applies to the accrual of market discount, we must include in income any market discount as we take the same into account on our financial statements. 
 In addition, some debt obligations with a fixed maturity date of more than one year from the date of issuance (and zero-coupon debt obligations with a fixed maturity date of more than one year from the date of issuance) that we originate or acquire will be treated as debt obligations that are issued originally at a discount. Generally, the amount of the original issue discount (OID) is treated as interest income and is included in taxable income (and we are required to distribute it) over the term of the debt obligation, even though payment of that amount is not received until a later time, upon partial or full repayment or disposition of the debt obligation. In addition, payment-in-kind (PIK) securities we originate or acquire will give rise to income which is required to be distributed and is taxable even though we receive no interest payment in cash on the security during the year in which the income was accrued. 
 Some debt obligations with a fixed maturity date of one year or less from the date of issuance that we originate or acquire may be treated as having OID or, in certain cases, acquisition discount (very generally, the excess of the stated redemption price over the purchase price). Generally, we will be required to include the OID or acquisition discount in income (as ordinary income) over the term of the debt obligation and thus distribute it over the term of the debt obligation, even though payment of that amount is not received until a later time, upon partial or full repayment or disposition of the debt obligation. The rate at which OID or acquisition discount accrues, and thus is included in our income, will depend upon which of the permitted accrual methods we elect. 
 Some preferred securities may include provisions that permit the issuer, at its discretion, to defer the payment of distributions for a stated period without any adverse consequences to the issuer. If we own a preferred security that is deferring the payment of its distributions, we may be required to report income for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of any such deferred distribution even though we have not yet actually received the cash distribution. 
 As a result of holding the foregoing kinds of obligations, we may be required to pay out as an income distribution each year an amount which is greater than the total amount of cash interest (or dividends in the case of preferred securities) we actually received. Such distributions may be made from, among other things, our cash assets or cash generated from our liquidation of portfolio securities. We may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we realize net long-term or short-term capital gains from such transactions, our shareholders may receive a larger capital gain or ordinary dividend, respectively, than they would in the absence of such transactions. 
 Investments in distressed debt obligations that are at risk of or in default present special tax issues. Tax rules are not entirely clear about issues such as whether and to what extent we should recognize market discount on these debt obligations; when we may cease to accrue interest, OID or market discount; when and to what extent we may take deductions for bad debts or worthless securities; and how we should allocate payments received on obligations in default between principal and income. We will address these and other related issues when, as and if we invest in such obligations, in order to seek to ensure that we distribute sufficient income to preserve our eligibility for treatment as a RIC and do not become subject to U.S. federal income or excise tax. 
 
17 


 A portion of the OID accrued on certain high-yield discount obligations we own may not be deductible to the issuer and will instead be treated as a dividend paid by the issuer for purposes of the dividends-received deduction. In such cases, if the issuer of the obligation is a domestic corporation, dividend payments we make may be eligible for the dividends-received deduction to the extent of the deemed dividend portion of such OID. 
 Our transactions in foreign currencies, foreign currency-denominated debt obligations and certain foreign currency options, futures contracts and forward contracts (and similar instruments) may give rise to ordinary income or loss to the extent such income or loss results from fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency concerned. Such ordinary income treatment may accelerate our distributions to shareholders and increase the distributions taxed to shareholders as ordinary income. We cannot carry forward any net ordinary losses so created to offset income or gains earned in subsequent years. 
 Special tax rules may change the treatment of gains and losses we recognize when we make certain investments outside the United States. The application of these special rules may accelerate or increase our recognition of ordinary income or loss, and affect the timing, amount and/or character of our distributions. In addition, dividend, interest, capital gains and other income we receive from investments outside the United States may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by foreign countries. Tax treaties between the United States and other countries may reduce or eliminate such taxes. We do not expect that we will be eligible to elect to treat any foreign taxes we pay as paid by our shareholders, and therefore shareholders will not be entitled to claim a credit or deduction for such taxes on their own tax returns. Foreign taxes we pay or are withheld from us will reduce the return from our underlying investments. 
 Some of our investments outside the United States, including our CLO investments, may be treated as investments in passive foreign investment companies (PFICs), as defined below, and could subject us to U.S. federal income tax (including interest charges) on distributions received from a PFIC or on proceeds received from the disposition of shares in a PFIC, which tax cannot be eliminated by making distributions to our shareholders. However, we may elect to avoid the imposition of that tax. For example, we may elect to treat a PFIC as a qualified electing fund (QEF) (i.e., make a QEF election), in which case we will be required to include our share of the PFICs income and net capital gain annually, regardless of whether it receives any distribution from the PFIC. Alternatively, we may elect to mark the gains (and to a limited extent the losses) in such holdings to the market as though we had sold (and, solely for purposes of this mark-to-market election, repurchased) our holdings in those PFICs on the last day of our taxable year. Such gains and losses are treated as ordinary income and loss. The QEF and mark-to-market elections may have the effect of accelerating the recognition of income (without the receipt of cash) and increasing the amount required to be distributed for us to avoid taxation. Making either of these elections therefore may require us to liquidate other investments (including when it is not advantageous to do so) to meet our distribution requirement, which also may accelerate the recognition of gain and affect our total return. Dividends paid by PFICs will not be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income. In addition, whether a foreign corporation is a PFIC is not always entirely clear. Therefore, there is a risk, for example, that we may not realize that a foreign corporation in which we invest is a PFIC for U.S. federal tax purposes and thus we may fail to timely make a QEF or mark-to-market election in respect of that corporation, in which event we could be subject to the U.S. federal income taxes and interest charges described above. 
 A PFIC is any foreign corporation in which (i) 75% or more of the gross income for the taxable year is passive income, or (ii) the average percentage of the assets (generally by value, but by adjusted tax basis in certain cases) that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income is at least 50%. Generally, passive income for this purpose means dividends, interest (including income equivalent to interest), royalties, rents, annuities, the excess of gains over losses from certain property transactions and commodities transactions, income from certain notional principal contracts, and foreign currency gains. Passive income for this purpose does not include rents and royalties received by the foreign corporation from active business and certain income received from related persons. 
 If we own (directly or indirectly) 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of a foreign corporation or 10% or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of a foreign corporation that is treated as a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) (including equity tranche investments and certain debt tranche investments in a CLO treated as CFC), we are a U.S. Shareholder for purposes of the CFC provisions of the Code. A CFC is a foreign corporation that, on any day of its taxable year, is owned (directly, indirectly, or constructively) more than 50% (measured by voting power or value) by U.S. Shareholders. A U.S. Shareholder is required to include in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes for each taxable year of the U.S. Shareholder its pro rata share of its CFCs subpart F income for the CFCs taxable year ending within the U.S. Shareholders taxable year whether or not such income is actually distributed by the CFC. Subpart F income generally includes interest, OID, dividends, net gains from the disposition of stocks or securities, net gains from transactions (including futures, forward, and similar transactions) in commodities, receipts with respect to securities loans, and net payments received with respect to equity swaps and similar derivatives. Subpart F income is treated as ordinary income, regardless of the character of the CFCs underlying income. To the extent we invest in CFCs, if any, and recognize subpart F income in excess of actual cash distributions from such CFCs, if any, we may be required to sell assets (including when it is not advantageous to do so) to generate the cash necessary to distribute as dividends to our shareholders all of our income and gains and therefore to eliminate any corporate-level tax liability. 
 
18 


 We may make certain investments through one or more wholly-owned entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such corporations may be required to pay U.S. federal, state and local corporate income or other tax on their earnings, which ultimately will reduce the return on our underlying investments. 
 Income we realize from or the proceeds of dispositions of our non-U.S. investments may be subject to non-U.S. withholding or other taxes. We may otherwise be subject to non-U.S. taxation on repatriation proceeds generated from those investments or to other transaction-based non-U.S. taxes on those investments. Those withholding taxes or other taxes as well as any U.S. withholding taxes applicable to our investments, including in respect of investments in our wholly-owned subsidiaries, if any, will reduce the return on our investments. 
 Our derivative transactions, as well as any of our other hedging, short sale or similar transactions, may be subject to one or more special tax rules (including, for instance, notional principal contract, mark-to-market, constructive sale, straddle, wash sale and short-sale rules). These rules may affect whether gains and losses we recognize are treated as ordinary or capital and/or as short-term or long-term, accelerate our recognition of income or gains, defer losses, and cause adjustments in the holding periods of our securities. The rules could therefore affect the amount, timing and/or character of our distributions to shareholders. 
 Because the tax rules applicable to derivative financial instruments are in some cases uncertain under current law, an adverse determination or future guidance by the IRS with respect to these rules (which determination or guidance could be retroactive) may affect whether we have made sufficient distributions, and otherwise satisfied the relevant requirements, to maintain our qualification as a RIC and avoid a corporate-level tax. 
 Certain of our derivative transactions and investments in foreign currency-denominated instruments, and any of our transactions in foreign currencies and hedging activities, are likely to produce a difference between our book income and the sum of our taxable income and net tax-exempt income (if any). If such a difference arises, and our book income is less than the sum of our taxable income and net tax-exempt income (if any), we could be required to make distributions exceeding book income to qualify as a RIC that is accorded special tax treatment and to avoid a corporate-level tax. In the alternative, if our book income exceeds the sum of our taxable income and net tax-exempt income (if any), the distribution (if any) of such excess generally will be treated as (i) a dividend to the extent of our remaining earnings and profits (including earnings and profits arising from any tax-exempt income), (ii) thereafter, as a return of capital to the extent of the recipients basis in its shares, and (iii) thereafter, as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset. 
 Pursuant to a notice issued by the IRS and Treasury Regulations that have yet to be issued but may apply retroactively, a portion of our income (including income allocated from certain pass-through entities) that is attributable to a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit or taxable mortgage pool (referred to in the Code as an excess inclusion) will be subject to U.S. federal income tax in all events. This notice also provides, and the regulations are expected to provide, that excess inclusion income of a RIC will be allocated to shareholders of the RIC in proportion to the dividends received by such shareholders, with the same consequences as if the shareholders held the related interest directly. As a result, to the extent we invest in any such interests, it may not be a suitable investment for certain tax-exempt shareholders. Although we do not expect to make investments that generate or pass- through excess inclusion income in the manner described above, we may make such investments, and may need to make certain elections set forth in the IRS notice governing such matters. 
 In general, excess inclusion income allocated to shareholders (i) cannot be offset by net operating losses (subject to a limited exception for certain thrift institutions), (ii) will constitute unrelated business taxable income (UBTI) to entities (including a qualified pension plan, an individual retirement account, a 401(k) plan, a Keogh plan or other tax-exempt entity) subject to tax on UBTI, thereby potentially requiring such an entity that is allocated excess inclusion income, and otherwise might not be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return, to file such a tax return and pay tax on such income, and (iii) in the case of a non-U.S. shareholder, will not qualify for any reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax. A shareholder will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such inclusions notwithstanding any exemption from such income tax otherwise available under the Code. 
 Our ability to pursue our investment strategy, including a strategy focused on investments in CLOs, certain debt instruments and the generation of fee income, may be limited by our intention to qualify as a RIC and our strategy may bear adversely on our ability to so qualify. 
 Backup Withholding 
 Your broker or other intermediary may be required to withhold, for U.S. federal backup withholding tax purposes, a portion of the dividends, distributions and redemption proceeds payable to a non-corporate shareholder who fails to provide the broker or other intermediary with the shareholders correct taxpayer identification number (in the case of an individual, generally, such individuals social security number) or to make the required certification, or who has been notified by the IRS that such shareholder is subject to backup withholding. Certain shareholders are exempt from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be refunded or credited against your U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that you furnish the required information to the IRS. 
 
19 


 Sale or Exchange of Our Shares 
 If you sell or otherwise dispose of our common shares, you will generally recognize a gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between your tax basis in such shares and the amount you receive in exchange for such shares. Any such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held (or are treated as having held) such shares for more than one year at the time of sale. All or a portion of any loss you realize on a taxable sale or exchange of your shares will be disallowed if you acquire other shares from us (whether through the automatic reinvestment of dividends or otherwise) within a 61-day period beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after your sale or exchange of our shares. In such case, the basis of the shares acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss. In addition, any loss realized upon a taxable sale or exchange of our shares held (or deemed held) by you for six months or less will be treated as long-term, rather than short-term, to the extent of any capital gain dividends received (or deemed received) by you with respect to those shares. 
 You may be entitled to offset your Capital Gain Dividends with capital loss. The Code contains a number of statutory provisions affecting the circumstances under which capital loss may be offset against capital gain and limiting the use of loss from certain investments and activities. Accordingly, if you have capital losses we urge you to consult your tax advisor. 
 Upon the sale or exchange of our common shares, your broker or other intermediary generally will be required to provide you and the IRS with cost basis and certain other related tax information about the shares you sold or exchanged. This cost basis reporting requirement is effective for shares purchased, including through dividend reinvestment. Please consult your broker or other intermediary for more information regarding available methods for cost basis reporting and how to select a particular method. Please consult your tax advisor to determine which available cost basis method is best for you. 
 When we make a tender offer for our shares (as described in Share Repurchase Program) and you tender all common shares you hold, or are considered to be holding, and you do not hold (directly or by attribution) any other units of our shares (e.g., preferred shares, if any), you will be treated as having sold your shares and generally will realize a capital gain or loss. If you tender fewer than all of your common shares or continue to hold (directly or by attribution) other units of our shares (e.g., preferred shares, if any), there is some risk that you may be treated as having received a distribution under Section 301 of the Code (Section 301 distribution) unless the redemption is treated as being either (i) substantially disproportionate or (ii) otherwise not essentially equivalent to a dividend under the relevant rules of the Code. A Section 301 distribution is not treated as a sale or exchange giving rise to a capital gain or loss, but rather is treated as a dividend to the extent supported by our current and accumulated earnings and profits, with the excess treated as a return of capital reducing your tax basis in Company shares, and thereafter as capital gain. Where a redeeming shareholder is treated as receiving a dividend, there is a risk that non-tendering shareholders whose interests in the Company increase as a result of such tender will be treated as having received a taxable distribution from us. Dividend treatment of a tender would also affect the amount and character of income that we are required to distribute for the year in which the redemption occurred. It is possible that such a dividend would qualify as qualified dividend income; otherwise, it would be taxable as ordinary income. To the extent we recognize net gains on the liquidation of portfolio securities to meet such tenders, we will be required to make additional distributions to our common shareholders. 
 Non-U.S. Shareholders 
 Distributions we pay to shareholders that are not U.S. persons within the meaning of the Code (foreign shareholders) and that we properly report as (1) Capital Gain Dividends, (2) interest-related dividends, and (3) short-term capital gain dividends, each as defined below and subject to certain conditions described below, generally are not subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax. 
 In general, the Code defines (1) short-term capital gain dividends as distributions of net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses and (2) interest-related dividends as distributions from U.S. source interest income of types similar to those not subject to U.S. federal income tax if earned directly by an individual foreign shareholder, in each case to the extent such distributions are properly reported as such by us in a written notice to shareholders. The exceptions to withholding for Capital Gain Dividends and short-term capital gain dividends do not apply to (A) distributions to an individual foreign shareholder who is present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the year of the distribution and (B) distributions attributable to gain that is treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a trade or business within the United States under special rules regarding the disposition of U.S. real property interests. The exception to withholding for interest-related dividends does not apply to distributions to a foreign shareholder (A) that has not provided a satisfactory statement that the beneficial owner is not a U.S. person, (B) to the extent that the dividend is attributable to certain interest on an obligation if the foreign shareholder is the issuer or is a 10% shareholder of the issuer, (C) that is within certain foreign countries that have inadequate information exchange with the United States, or (D) to the extent the dividend is attributable to interest 
 
20 


  paid by a person that is a related person of the foreign shareholder and the foreign shareholder is a controlled foreign corporation. We are permitted to report such part of our dividends as interest-related and/or short-term capital gain dividends as are eligible, but are not required to do so. In the case of shares held through an intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if we report all or a portion of a payment as an interest-related or short-term capital gain dividend to shareholders. 
 Foreign shareholders should contact their intermediaries regarding the application of these rules to their accounts. 
 Distributions to foreign shareholders other than Capital Gain Dividends, interest-related dividends, and short-term capital gain dividends (e.g., dividends attributable to dividend and foreign-source interest income or to short-term capital gains or U.S. source interest income to which the exception from withholding described above does not apply) are generally subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate). 
 A foreign shareholder is not, in general, subject to U.S. federal income tax on gains (and is not allowed a deduction for losses) realized on the sale of our shares unless (i) such gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business carried on by such holder within the United States, (ii) in the case of an individual holder, the holder is present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the year of the sale and certain other conditions are met, or (iii) certain special rules relating to gain attributable to the sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests apply to the foreign shareholders sale of our shares. 
 Foreign shareholders with respect to whom income from us is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the foreign shareholder within the United States will in general be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the income derived from us at the graduated rates applicable to U.S. citizens, residents or domestic corporations, whether such income is received in cash or reinvested in additional units of our shares and, in the case of a foreign corporation, may also be subject to a branch profits tax. If a foreign shareholder is eligible for the benefits of a tax treaty, any effectively connected income or gain will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis only if it is also attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the shareholder in the United States. More generally, foreign shareholders who are residents of a country with an income tax treaty with the United States may obtain different tax results than those described herein, and are urged to consult their tax advisors. 
 In order to have qualified for any exemption from withholding described above (to the extent applicable) or for lower withholding tax rates under income tax treaties, or to establish an exemption from backup withholding, a foreign shareholder must have complied with applicable certification and filing requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, Form W-8BEN-E or substitute form). Foreign shareholders should contact their tax advisors in this regard. 
 Special rules (including withholding and reporting requirements) apply to foreign partnerships and those holding our shares through foreign partnerships. Additional considerations may apply to foreign trusts and estates. Investors holding our shares through foreign entities should consult their tax advisors. 
 A foreign shareholder may be subject to state and local tax and to the U.S. federal estate tax in addition to the U.S. federal tax on income referred to above. 
 Other Reporting and Withholding Requirements 
 Sections 1471-1474 of the Code, and the U.S. Treasury Regulations and IRS guidance issued thereunder (collectively, FATCA), generally require us to obtain information sufficient to identify the status of each of our shareholders under FATCA or under an applicable intergovernmental agreement (an IGA). If a shareholder fails to provide the required information or otherwise fails to comply with FATCA or an IGA, we or our agent may be required to withhold under FATCA 30% of ordinary dividends that we pay to that shareholder and, after December 31, 2018, 30% of the gross proceeds of the sale, redemption or exchange of our shares and certain capital gain dividends we pay to that shareholder. If we make a payment that is subject to FATCA withholding, we, or our agent, are required to withhold even if the payment would otherwise be exempt from withholding under rules applicable to non-U.S. shareholders (e.g., Capital Gain Dividends, short-term capital gain dividends and interest-related dividends). You are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the applicability of FATCA and any other reporting requirements. In addition, foreign countries are considering, and may implement, laws similar in purpose and scope to FATCA. 
 The discussions set forth herein do not constitute tax advice, and you are urged to consult your own tax adviser to determine the specific U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences to you of investing with us.
