ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction
 
Chardan Healthcare Acquisition Corp. (“CHAC”) is a Delaware company incorporated on November 1, 2017 as a blank check company for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, with one or more target businesses. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to any particular industry or geographic location, although we intend to focus on targets located in North America in the healthcare industry
 
On December 18, 2018, we consummated our initial public offering (“IPO”) of 7,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock (the “Common Stock”) and one redeemable warrant to purchase one-half of one share of common stock (the “Public Warrants”). The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $70,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,050,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any. The over-allotment option expired unexercised on February 4, 2019.
 
On December 18, 2018, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with Mountain Wood, LLC, an affiliate of our Sponsor, of 2,900,000 warrants (the “Private Warrants”) at a price of $0.40 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $1,160,000. The Private Warrants are identical to the Warrants sold in the IPO, except that the Private Warrants (i) may be exercised on a cashless basis at the holder’s option, (ii) will not be redeemable by the Company, in each case as long as they are held by our Sponsor or its permitted transferees, and (iii) are exercisable for one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. Additionally, the Private Warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis and are non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. Additionally, our Mountain Wood, LLC agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Warrants or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the registration statement relating to the IPO) until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. Mountain Wood, LLC was granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the Private Warrants.
 
A total of $70,000,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the IPO and the private placement on December 18, 2018 were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders at Morgan Stanley maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, other than interest income to pay any tax obligations, until the earlier of (i) the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination and (ii) the Company’s failure to consummate a business combination by December 18, 2020. 
 
Business Combination Agreement
 
On July 16, 2019, we entered into a merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement” or the “Agreement”) with BiomX Ltd. (“BiomX”) and CHAC Merger Sub Ltd. (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into BiomX, with BiomX surviving as our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger”).
 
As a result of the Merger, subject to reduction for indemnification claims as described below, an aggregate of 16,625,000 shares of CHAC common stock will be issued (or reserved for issuance pursuant to currently exercisable options or warrants) in respect of shares of BiomX capital stock that are issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and options and warrants to purchase shares of BiomX capital stock, in each case, that are issued, outstanding and vested as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. Additional shares of CHAC common stock will be reserved for issuance in respect of options to purchase shares of BiomX capital stock that are issued, outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger.

In connection with the Acquisition, we filed and will file relevant materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including a proxy statement on Schedule 14A. Promptly after filing our definitive proxy statement with the SEC, we will mail the definitive proxy statement and a proxy card to each stockholder entitled to vote at the special meeting relating to the acquisition. INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF CHAC ARE URGED TO READ THESE MATERIALS (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION THAT CHAC WILL FILE WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT CHAC, BIOMX AND THE MERGER. The preliminary proxy statement, the definitive proxy statement and other relevant materials in connection with the acquisition (when they become available), and any other documents filed by us with the SEC, may be obtained free of charge at the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov) or by writing to us at 17 State Street, 21st Floor, New York, NY 10004.
 
Competitive Advantages
 
Our sponsor was founded in November 2017 and is affiliated with Chardan Capital Markets LLC, the representative of the underwriters from our initial public offering, an investment firm and a provider of investment banking services, primarily focused on emerging growth companies in the healthcare industry. Chardan conducts business across North America, Europe, Asia (including Israel) and Australia. Since its inception, Chardan has executed over 400 equity capital markets transactions, raising approximately $19 billion of capital in both public and private markets.
 
Our management team is led by Dr. Gbola Amusa, Jonas Grossman and George Kaufman; each has extensive experience in healthcare both before and during their current tenure at Chardan
 
Dr. Gbola Amusa currently leads Chardan’s equity research team, a team that has published over 500 research notes since 2013, with a major focus on covering biotechnology companies, particularly those with disruptive potential in the genetic medicines space.
 
Jonas Grossman leads Chardan’s capital markets team which has executed over 400 transactions since inception. In addition to its broader emerging growth and SPAC activities, the team has completed over 130 offerings for healthcare companies raising over $5.0 billion since 2005 and over 60 offerings for healthcare companies raising over $3.5 billion since the beginning of 2016. Chardan has a healthcare-focused corporate access team which sponsors two healthcare conferences and manages in excess of 100 non-deal road shows per year for both private and public healthcare companies. The corporate access team serves as a nexus for issuers and healthcare investors (venture capital, private equity, and asset managers) in North America, Europe and Australia.
 
George Kaufman leads Chardan’s investment banking group, which, in addition to working on the deals described in the preceding paragraph, has advised on the business combinations of 13 SPACs, as well as participated in key roles in the 4 previous Chardan-branded SPACs.
 
Together, Mr. Grossman, Mr. Kaufman, and their teams have acted as underwriter on 74 SPAC IPO’s since 2004 that generated gross proceeds of approximately $9.0 billion. Since the beginning of 2016, Chardan has ranked as the most active book running or lead-managing underwriter of SPAC IPO’s, acting in such capacity on 31 SPAC IPO’s that raised gross proceeds of approximately $3.9 billion in that period.
 
We believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team will provide us with an important source of prospective target businesses. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises.
 
We have also assembled a group of independent directors who have a broad range of operational, scientific and industry experience within healthcare. Over the course of their careers, our directors have developed a broad international network of contacts and corporate relationships, and they have gained extensive experience with acquisitions, divestitures and corporate strategy and implementation, which we believe will significantly benefit us as we evaluate potential acquisition or merger candidates as well as following the completion of our initial business combination.

We believe that our management team is well positioned to identify attractive risk-adjusted returns in the marketplace and that our contacts and transaction sources, ranging from industry executives, private owners, private equity funds, and investment bankers, in addition to the geographical reach of our affiliates, will enable us to pursue a broad range of opportunities.
 
Acquisition Strategy
 
Our acquisition strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, to build a public company. Our selection process will leverage our team’s network of industry, venture capital, hedge fund, private equity and lending community relationships as well as relationships with management teams of public and private companies, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, which we believe should provide us with a number of business combination opportunities. We intend to deploy a proactive, thematic sourcing strategy and to focus on companies where we believe the combination of the relationships, capital, capital markets expertise and operating experience of executives at Chardan, can help accelerate the target business’ growth and performance. We will initially focus on emerging growth healthcare companies in sectors including, but not limited to, biotechnology, medical technology and digital health.
Investment Criteria
 
We are focused on companies in disruptive and other value added subsegments of healthcare that have the potential for significant gains in the next five years. Our ideal company will be institutionally backed, with a high-quality management team and a demonstrated ability to raise money from the private capital markets. The segments we will target include biotechnology, medical technology and digital health.
 
The focus of our management team is to create stockholder value by leveraging its experience to efficiently guide an emerging healthcare company towards commercialization. Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. While we intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating prospective businesses, we may deviate from these criteria and guidelines should we see fit to do so: 
 

● | Healthcare Company Poised for Rapid Growth
--+-------------------------------------------

 
We intend to primarily seek to acquire one or more growth businesses with a total equity value of greater than 5 to 10 times the amount of the proceeds of our initial public offering. We believe that there are a substantial number of potential target businesses with appropriate valuations that can benefit from a public listing and new capital for growth to support significant revenue and earnings growth or to advance clinical programs. We do not intend to acquire a start-up company.
 

● | Niche Leader and Specialized Business with High Growth Potential
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

 
We intend to seek target companies that have significant and underexploited expansion opportunities in a niche sector. This can be accomplished through a combination of accelerating organic growth and finding attractive add-on acquisition targets. Our management team has significant experience in identifying such targets and in helping target management assess the strategic and financial fit. Similarly, our management has the expertise to assess the likely synergies and a process to help a target integrate acquisitions. Additionally, our management team has extensive experience assisting healthcare companies raise money as they navigate the regulatory approval process.

● | Benefits from Being a U.S. Public Company (Value Creation and Marketing Opportunities)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We intend to seek target companies that should offer attractive risk-adjusted equity returns for our stockholders. We intend to seek to acquire a target on terms and in a manner that leverage our experience. We expect to evaluate a Company based on its potential to successfully achieve regulatory approval and commercialize its product(s). We also expect to evaluate financial returns based on (i) risk-adjusted peak sales potential (ii) the potential of pipeline products and the scientific platform (iii) the ability to achieve the system cost savings, (iv) the ability to accelerate growth via other options, including through the opportunity for follow-on acquisitions and (v) the prospects for creating value through other value creation initiatives. Potential upside, for example, from the growth in the target business’ earnings or an improved capital structure will be weighed against any identified downside risks.
 

● | Potential Benefit from Globalization Trends and Possession of Competitive Advantages
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Target companies exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics that we believe have been misevaluated by the marketplace based on company-specific analyses and due diligence. For a potential target company, this process will include, among other things, a review and analysis of the company’s capital structure, quality of current or future earnings, preclinical or clinical data, potential for operational improvements, corporate governance, customers, material contracts, and the industry and trends. We intend to leverage the operational experience and disciplined investment approach of our team to identify opportunities to unlock value that our experience in complex situations allows us to pursue.
 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.
 
We will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial stockholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of our proposed business combination or allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. If we so choose and we are legally permitted to do so, we will have the flexibility to avoid a stockholder vote and allow our stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
 
We will have until 24 months from the consummation of the IPO to consummate our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem or purchase 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes, and then seek to liquidate and dissolve. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders. In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, the public warrants will expire and will be worthless.
 
If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within this time period, we will liquidate the trust account and distribute the proceeds held therein to our public stockholders and dissolve. If we are forced to liquidate, we anticipate that we would distribute to our public stockholders the amount in the trust account calculated as of the date that is two days prior to the distribution date (including any accrued interest). Prior to such distribution, we would be required to assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us by our creditors for amounts they are actually owed and make provision for such amounts, as creditors take priority over our public stockholders with respect to amounts that are owed to them. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims of creditors to the extent of distributions received by them as an unlawful payment in the event we enter an insolvent liquidation.

Pursuant to the NYSE American listing rules, our initial business combination must be with a target business or businesses whose collective fair market value is at least equal to 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding any taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for such business combination, although this may entail simultaneous acquisitions of several target businesses. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Our board of directors will have broad discretion in choosing the standard used to establish the fair market value of any prospective target business. The target business or businesses that we acquire may have a collective fair market value substantially in excess of 80% of the trust account balance.
 
We are not required to obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party that the target business we select has a fair market value in excess of at least 80% of the balance of the trust account unless our board of directors cannot make such determination on its own. We are also not required to obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party indicating that the price we are paying is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view unless the target is affiliated with our officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates.
 
We currently anticipate structuring our initial business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, only the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test.
 
Management Operating and Investment Experience
 
We believe that our executive officers possess the experience, skills and contacts necessary to source, evaluate, and execute an attractive business combination. See the section titled “Management” for complete information on the experience of our officers and directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs and will allocate their time to other businesses. We presently expect each of our employees to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). The past successes of our executive officers and directors do not guarantee that we will successfully consummate an initial business combination.
 
As more fully discussed in “Conflicts of Interest,” if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Delaware law, prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Most of our officers and directors currently have certain pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations.

Emerging Growth Company Status and Other Information
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (which we refer to herein as the JOBS Act). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised, and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statement with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the date of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three year period.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.

Employees
 
We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
