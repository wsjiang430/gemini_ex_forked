Item 1.  Business
Overview
 
We are a specialty finance company. Our primary business is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealers and select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passenger vans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealers who have limited credit histories or past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, facilitating sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources, such as commercial banks, credit unions and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts directly from dealers, we have also acquired installment purchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions. We also offer financing directly to sub-prime consumers to facilitate their purchase of a new or used automobile, light truck or passenger van. In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as "automobile contracts" and all such purchases or acquisitions as “originations” or “acquisitions”.
 
We were incorporated and began our operations in March 1991. We consist of Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” “us,” “CPS” or “the Company”). From inception through December 31, 2018, we have purchased a total of approximately $15.2 billion of automobile contracts from dealers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately $822.3 million of automobile contracts in mergers and acquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and, most recently in September 2011. Contract purchase volumes and managed portfolio levels for the five years ended December 31, 2018 are shown in the table below. Managed portfolio comprises both contracts we owned and those we were servicing for non-affiliates.

Our principal executive offices are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Credit and underwriting functions are performed primarily in our California branch with certain of these functions also performed in our Florida and Nevada branches. We service our automobile contracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida and Illinois branches.
 
The majority of our contract acquisitions volume results from our purchases of retail installment sales contracts from franchised or independent automobile dealers. We establish relationships with dealers through our employee marketing representatives, who contact prospective dealers to explain our automobile contract purchase programs, and thereafter provide dealer training and support services. Our marketing representatives represent us exclusively. They may be located in our Irvine branch, in our Las Vegas branch, or in the field, in which case they work from their homes and support dealers in their geographic area. Our marketing representatives present dealers with a marketing package, which includes our promotional material containing the terms offered by us for the purchase of automobile contracts, a copy of our standard-form dealer agreement, and required documentation relating to automobile contracts. As of December 31, 2018, we had 81 marketing representatives and in that month we received applications from 8,201 dealers in 46 states. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 74% of our active dealers were franchised new car dealers that sell both new and used vehicles, and the remainder were independent used car dealers.

We also solicit credit applications directly from prospective automobile consumers through the internet under a program we refer to as our direct lending platform. For qualified applicants we offer terms similar to those that we offer through dealers, though without a down payment requirement and with more restrictive loan-to-value and credit score requirements. Applicants approved in this fashion are free to shop for and purchase a vehicle from a dealer of their choosing, after which we enter into a note and security agreement directly with the consumer. During the year ended December 31, 2018 automobile contracts originated under the direct lending platform represented 2.8% of our total acquisitions and represented 1.6% of our outstanding managed portfolio as of December 31, 2018. Regardless of whether an automobile contract is originated from one of our dealers or through our direct lending platform, the discussion that follows regarding our acquisitions guidelines, procedures and demographic statistics applies to all of our originated contracts.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 74% of the automobile contracts originated under our programs consisted of financing for used cars and 26% consisted of financing for new cars, as compared to 75% financing for used cars and 25% for new cars in the year ended December 31, 2017.
 
We originate automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizations are transactions in which we sell a specified pool of automobile contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours. The subsidiary in turn issues (or contributes to a trust that issues) asset-backed securities, which are purchased by institutional investors. Since 1994, we have completed 80 term securitizations of approximately $13.4 billion in automobile contracts. We depend upon the availability of short-term warehouse credit facilities as interim financing for our contract purchases prior to the time we pool those contracts for a securitization. As of December 31, 2018 we have three such short-term warehouse facilities, each with a maximum borrowing amount of $100 million.
 
Sub-Prime Auto Finance Industry
 
Automobile financing is the second largest consumer finance market in the United States. The automobile finance industry can be considered a continuum where participants choose to provide financing to consumers in various segments of the spectrum of creditworthiness depending on each participant’s business strategy. We operate in a segment of the spectrum that is frequently referred to as sub-prime since we provide financing to less credit-worthy borrowers at higher rates of interest than more credit-worthy borrowers are likely to obtain.
 
Traditional automobile finance companies, such as banks, their subsidiaries, credit unions and captive finance subsidiaries of automobile manufacturers, generally lend to the most creditworthy, or so-called prime, borrowers, although some traditional lenders are significant participants in the sub-prime segment in which we operate. Historically, independent companies specializing in sub-prime automobile financing and subsidiaries of larger financial services companies have competed in the sub-prime segment which we believe remains highly fragmented, with no single company having a dominant position in the market.
 
Our automobile financing programs are designed to serve sub-prime customers, who generally have limited credit histories or past credit problems. Because we serve customers who are unable to meet certain credit standards, we incur greater risks, and generally receive interest rates higher than those charged in the prime credit market. We also sustain a higher level of credit losses because of the higher risk customers we serve.
 
Contract Acquisitions
 
When a retail automobile buyer elects to obtain financing from a dealer, the dealer takes a credit application to submit to its financing sources. Typically, a dealer will submit the buyer's application to more than one financing source for review. We believe the dealer’s decision to choose a financing source is based primarily on: (i) the interest rate and monthly payment made available to the dealer's customer; (ii) any fees to be charged to (or paid to) the dealer by the financing source; (iii) the timeliness, consistency and predictability of response; (iv) funding turnaround time; (v) any conditions to purchase; and (vi) the financial stability of the financing source. Dealers can send credit applications to us by entering the necessary data on our website or through one of two third-party application aggregators. We also have a pass-through arrangement with another lender who sends us applications from their dealers in cases where that lender chooses not to approve those applications. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we received approximately 42% of all applications through DealerTrack (the industry leading dealership application aggregator), 38% through a pass-through arrangement we have with another lender, 16% via another aggregator, Route One and 4% via our website. Our automated application decisioning system produced our initial decision within seconds on approximately 99% of those applications.

Upon receipt an application, if the application meets certain minimum criteria, we immediately order two credit reports to document the buyer's credit history. If, upon review by our proprietary automated decisioning system, or in some cases, one of our credit analysts, we determine that the automobile contract meets our underwriting criteria, we advise the dealer of our decision to approve the contract and the terms under which we will purchase it. In some cases where we don’t grant an approval, we may suggest alternatives from the terms proposed by the dealer or request and review further information from the dealer.
 
Dealers with which we do business are under no obligation to submit any automobile contracts to us, nor are we obligated to purchase any automobile contracts from them. During the year ended December 31, 2018, no dealer accounted for as much as 1% of the total number of automobile contracts we purchased.
 
Under our direct lending platform, the applicant submits a credit application directly to us via our website, or in some cases, through a third-party who accepts such applications and refers them to us for a fee. In either case, we order two credit reports and process the application with the same automated application decisioning process as described above for applications from dealers. We then advise the applicant as to whether or not we would grant them credit and on what terms.

We purchase automobile contracts from dealers at a price generally computed as the total amount financed under the automobile contracts, adjusted for an acquisition fee, which may either increase or decrease the automobile contract purchase price we pay. The amount of the acquisition fee, and whether it results in an increase or decrease to the automobile contract purchase price, is based on the perceived credit risk of and, in some cases, the interest rate on the automobile contract. The following table summarizes the average net acquisition fees we charged dealers and the weighted average annual percentage rate on our purchased contracts for the periods shown:

Our pricing strategy is driven by our objectives for new contract purchase quantities and yield. We believe that levels of acquisition fees are determined primarily by competition in the marketplace, which has increased over the periods presented, and also by our pricing strategy. The competitive environment in recent years has resulted in higher fees paid to dealers in conjunction with our contract acquisitions, compared to the years 2016 and earlier when dealers were generally paying us fees. This change in the marketplace has increased our capital requirements for acquiring contracts.
 
We offer eight different financing programs, and price each program according to the relative credit risk. Our programs cover a wide band of the credit spectrum and are labeled as follows:
 
Bravo - this program accommodates an applicant with significant past non-performing credit including recent derogatory credit. Advance rates are lowest of all of our programs to offset the greater risk. To offset the low up-front advance to the dealer, we agree to pay the dealer a portion of future payments we receive from the obligor, depending on loan performance. The Bravo program was introduced in November of 2015 and was terminated in November of 2018.
First Time Buyer – This program accommodates an applicant who has limited significant past credit history, such as a previous auto loan. Since the applicant has limited credit history, the contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees tend to be higher, and the loan amount, loan-to-value ratio, down payment and payment-to-income ratio requirements tend to be more restrictive compared to our other programs.
Mercury / Delta – This program accommodates an applicant who may have had significant past non-performing credit including recent derogatory credit. As a result, the contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees tend to be higher, and the loan amount, loan-to-value ratio, down payment, and payment-to-income ratio requirements tend to be more restrictive compared to our other programs.
Standard – This program accommodates an applicant who may have significant past non-performing credit, but who has also exhibited some performing credit in their history. The contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees are comparable to the First Time Buyer and Mercury/Delta programs, but the loan amount and loan-to-value ratio requirements are somewhat less restrictive.
Alpha – This program accommodates applicants who may have a discharged bankruptcy, but who have also exhibited performing credit. In addition, the program allows for homeowners who may have had other significant non-performing credit in the past. The contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees are lower than the Standard program, down payment and payment-to-income ratio requirements are somewhat less restrictive.

-

Alpha Plus – This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but with a stronger history of recent performing credit, such as auto or mortgage related credit, and higher incomes than the Alpha program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower than the Alpha program.
Super Alpha – This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but with a somewhat stronger history of recent performing credit, including auto or mortgage related credit, and higher incomes than the Alpha Plus program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower, and the maximum loan amount is somewhat higher, than the Alpha Plus program.
Preferred - This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but who demonstrate a somewhat stronger history of recent performing credit than the Super Alpha program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower, and the maximum loan amount is somewhat higher than the Super Alpha program.
 
Our upper credit tier products, which are our Preferred, Super Alpha, Alpha Plus and Alpha programs, accounted for approximately 79% of our new contract acquisitions in 2018, and 73% in 2017 and 2016, measured by aggregate amount financed.
 
The following table identifies the credit program, sorted from highest to lowest credit quality, under which we originated automobile contracts during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

We attempt to control misrepresentation regarding the customer's credit worthiness by carefully screening the automobile contracts we originate, by establishing and maintaining professional business relationships with dealers, and by including certain representations and warranties by the dealer in the dealer agreement. Pursuant to the dealer agreement, we may require the dealer to repurchase any automobile contract in the event that the dealer breaches its representations or warranties. There can be no assurance, however, that any dealer will have the willingness or the financial resources to satisfy its repurchase obligations to us.
 
Underwriting
 
For automobile contracts that we purchase from dealers, we require that the contract be originated by a dealer that has entered into a dealer agreement with us. Under our direct lending platform, we require the customer to sign a note and security agreement. In each case, the contract is secured by a first priority lien on a new or used automobile, light truck or passenger van and must meet our underwriting criteria. In addition, each automobile contract requires the customer to maintain physical damage insurance covering the financed vehicle and naming us as a loss payee. We may, nonetheless, suffer a loss upon theft or physical damage of any financed vehicle if the customer fails to maintain insurance as required by the automobile contract and is unable to pay for repairs to or replacement of the vehicle.

We believe that our underwriting criteria enable us to evaluate effectively the creditworthiness of sub-prime customers and the adequacy of the financed vehicle as security for an automobile contract. The underwriting criteria include standards for price, term, amount of down payment, installment payment and interest rate; mileage, age and type of vehicle; principal amount of the automobile contract in relation to the value of the vehicle; customer income level, employment and residence stability, credit history and debt service ability, as well as other factors. Specifically, our underwriting guidelines generally limit the maximum principal amount of a purchased automobile contract to 115% of wholesale book value in the case of used vehicles or to 115% of the manufacturer's invoice in the case of new vehicles, plus, in each case, sales tax, licensing and, when the customer purchases such additional items, a service contract or a product to supplement the customer’s casualty policy in the event of a total loss of the related vehicle. We generally do not finance vehicles that are more than 11 model years old or have in excess of 150,000 miles. The maximum term of a purchased contract is 72 months, although we consider the loan to value and mileage as significant factors in determining the maximum term of a contract. Automobile contract purchase criteria are subject to change from time to time as circumstances may warrant. Prior to purchasing an automobile contract, our underwriters verify the customer's employment, income, residency, insurance coverage, and credit information by contacting various parties noted on the customer's application, credit information bureaus and other sources. In addition, we contact each customer by telephone to confirm that the customer understands and agrees to the terms of the related automobile contract. During this "welcome call," we also ask the customer a series of open ended questions about his application and the contract, which may uncover potential misrepresentations.
 
Credit Scoring.  We use proprietary scoring models to assign each automobile contract two internal "credit scores" at the time the application is received and the customer's credit information is retrieved from the credit reporting agencies. These proprietary scores are used to help determine whether or not we want to approve the application and, if so, the program and pricing we will offer either to the dealer, or in the case of our direct lending platform, directly to the customer. Our internal credit scores are based on a variety of parameters including the customer's credit history, data derived from alternative sources such as utilities, telecom, and social media, length of employment, residence stability and total income. Once a vehicle is selected by the customer and a proposed deal structure is provided to us, our scores will then consider various deal structure parameters such as down payment amount, loan to value and the make and mileage of the vehicle. We have developed our credit scores utilizing statistical risk management techniques and historical performance data from our managed portfolio. We believe this improves our allocation of credit evaluation resources, enhances our competitiveness in the marketplace and manages the risk inherent in the sub-prime market.
Characteristics of Contracts.  All of the automobile contracts we purchase are fully amortizing and provide for level payments over the term of the automobile contract. All automobile contracts may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The table below compares certain characteristics, at the time of origination, of our contract purchases for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:

 | Contracts Purchased During the Year Ended | 
---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+----------
 | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017 | 
Average Original Amount Financed | $ | 17,114 | | $ | 16,319 
Average Original Term | | 69 months | | | 68 months
Average Down Payment Percent | | 9.1% | | | 10.6% 
Average Vehicle Purchase Price | $ | 16,184 | | $ | 16,044 
Average Age of Vehicle | | 4 years | | | 4 years 
Average Age of Customer | | 43 years | | | 43 years 
Average Time in Current Job | | 5 years | | | 6 years 
Average Household Annual Income | $ | 56,000 | | $ | 51,000 

Dealer Compliance.  The dealer agreement and related assignment contain representations and warranties by the dealer that an application for state registration of each financed vehicle, naming us as secured party with respect to the vehicle, was effected by the time of sale of the related automobile contract to us, and that all necessary steps have been taken to obtain a perfected first priority security interest in each financed vehicle in favor of us under the laws of the state in which the financed vehicle is registered. To the extent that we do not receive such state registration within three months of purchasing the automobile contract, our dealer compliance group will work with the dealer in an attempt to rectify the situation. If these efforts are unsuccessful, we generally will require the dealer to repurchase the automobile contract.

Servicing and Collection
 
We currently service all automobile contracts that we own as well as those automobile contracts that are included in portfolios that we have sold in securitizations or service for third parties. We organize our servicing activities based on the tasks performed by our personnel. Our servicing activities consist of mailing monthly billing statements; collecting, accounting for and posting of all payments received; responding to customer inquiries; taking all necessary action to maintain the security interest granted in the financed vehicle or other collateral; investigating delinquencies; communicating with the customer to obtain timely payments; repossessing and liquidating the collateral when necessary; collecting deficiency balances; and generally monitoring each automobile contract and the related collateral. We are typically entitled to receive a base monthly servicing fee equal to 2.5% per annum computed as a percentage of the declining outstanding principal balance of the non-charged-off automobile contracts in the securitization pools. The servicing fee is included in interest income for contracts that are pledged to a warehouse credit facility or a securitization transaction.
 
Collection Procedures.  We believe that our ability to monitor performance and collect payments owed from sub-prime customers is primarily a function of our collection approach and support systems. We believe that if payment problems are identified early and our collection staff works closely with customers to address these problems, it is possible to correct many problems before they deteriorate further. To this end, we utilize pro-active collection procedures, which include making early and frequent contact with delinquent customers; educating customers as to the importance of maintaining good credit; and employing a consultative and customer service approach to assist the customer in meeting his or her obligations, which includes attempting to identify the underlying causes of delinquency and cure them whenever possible. In support of our collection activities, we maintain a computerized collection system specifically designed to service automobile contracts with sub-prime customers.
 
We attempt to make telephonic contact with delinquent customers from one to 20 days after their monthly payment due date, depending on our assessment of the customer’s likelihood of payment during early stages of delinquency. If a customer has authorized us to do so, we may also send automated text message reminders at various stages of delinquency and our collectors may also choose to contact a customer via text message instead of, or in addition to, via telephone. Our contact priorities may be based on the customers' physical location, stage of delinquency, size of balance or other parameters. Our collectors inquire of the customer the reason for the delinquency and when we can expect to receive the payment. The collector will attempt to get the customer to make an electronic payment over the phone or a promise for the payment for a time generally not to exceed one week from the date of the call. If the customer makes such a promise, the account is routed to a promise queue and is not contacted until the outcome of the promise is known. If the payment is made by the promise date and the account is no longer delinquent, the account is routed out of the collection system. If the payment is not made, or if the payment is made, but the account remains delinquent, the account is returned to a collector’s queue for subsequent contacts.
 
If a customer fails to make or keep promises for payments, or if the customer is uncooperative or attempts to evade contact or hide the vehicle, a supervisor will review the collection activity relating to the account to determine if repossession of the vehicle is warranted. Generally, such a decision will occur between the 60th and 90th day past the customer's payment due date, but could occur sooner or later, depending on the specific circumstances. At the time the vehicle is repossessed we will stop accruing interest on this automobile contract, and reclassify the remaining automobile contract balance to other assets. In addition we will apply a specific reserve to this automobile contract so that the net balance represents the estimated fair value less costs to sell.
 
If we elect to repossess the vehicle, we assign the task to an independent national repossession service. Such services are licensed and/or bonded as required by law. Upon recovery it stored until it is picked up by a wholesale auction that we designate, where it is kept until sold. Financed vehicles that have been repossessed are generally resold through unaffiliated automobile auctions, which are attended principally by car dealers. Net liquidation proceeds are applied to the customer's outstanding obligation under the automobile contract. Such proceeds usually are insufficient to pay the customer's obligation in full, resulting in a deficiency. In most cases we will continue to contact our customers to recover all or a portion of this deficiency for up to several years after charge-off. From time to time, we sell certain charged off accounts to unaffiliated purchasers who specialize in collecting such accounts.
 
Once an automobile contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent, we do not recognize additional interest income until the borrower makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received by a borrower that are greater than 90 days delinquent are first applied to accrued interest and then to principal reduction.

We generally charge off the balance of any contract by the earlier of the end of the month in which the automobile contract becomes five scheduled installments past due or, in the case of repossessions, the month after we receive the proceeds from the liquidation of the financed vehicle or if the vehicle has been in repossession inventory for more than three months. In the case of repossession, the amount of the charge-off is the difference between the outstanding principal balance of the defaulted automobile contract and the net repossession sale proceeds.
 
Credit Experience
 
Our primary method of monitoring ongoing credit quality of our portfolio is to closely review monthly delinquency, default and net charge off activity and the related trends. Our internal credit performance data consistently show that new receivables have lower levels of delinquency and losses early in their lives, with delinquencies increasing throughout their lives and losses gradually increasing to a peak between 36 and 42 months, after which they gradually decrease. The weighted average seasoning of our total owned portfolio, represented in the tables below, was 23 months, 21 months and 18 months as of December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively. Our financial results are dependent on the performance of the automobile contracts in which we retain an ownership interest. Broad economic factors such as recession and significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does the weighted average age of the receivables at any given time. In addition, in June 2014 we became subject to a consent decree that required that we implement procedural changes in our servicing practices, which changes may have contributed to somewhat higher delinquencies, extensions and net losses compared to prior periods. The tables below document the delinquency, repossession and net credit loss experience of all such automobile contracts that we were servicing as of the respective dates shown. The tables do not include the experience of third party servicing portfolios, because we do not bear the credit risk on such portfolios.

Extensions
 
In certain circumstances we will grant obligors one-month payment extensions to assist them with temporary cash flow problems. In general, an obligor will not be permitted more than two such extensions in any 12-month period and no more than six over the life of the contract. The only modification of terms is to advance the obligor’s next due date, generally by one month, though in some cases we may permit a longer extension, and in any case an advance in the maturity date corresponding to the advance of the due date. There are no other concessions such as a reduction in interest rate, forgiveness of principal or of accrued interest. Accordingly, we consider such extensions to be insignificant delays in payments rather than troubled debt restructurings.
 
The basic question in deciding to grant an extension is whether or not we will (a) be delaying an inevitable repossession and liquidation or (b) risk losing the vehicle as a result of not being able to locate the obligor and vehicle. In both of those situations, the loss would likely be higher than if the vehicle had been repossessed without the extension. The benefits of granting an extension include minimizing current losses and delinquencies, minimizing lifetime losses, getting the obligor’s account current (or close to it) and building goodwill with the obligor so that he might prioritize us over other creditors on future payments. Our servicing staff are trained to identify when a past due obligor is facing a temporary problem that may be resolved with an extension. In most cases, the extension will be granted in conjunction with our receiving a past due payment or partial payment from the obligor, thereby indicating an additional monetary and psychological commitment to the contract on the obligor’s part.
 
The credit assessment for granting an extension is initially made by our collector, who bases the recommendation on the collector’s discussions with the obligor. In such assessments the collector will consider, among other things, the following factors: (1) the reason the obligor has fallen behind in payments; (2) whether or not the reason for the delinquency is temporary, and if it is, have conditions changed such that the obligor can begin making regular monthly payments again after the extension; (3) the obligor's past payment history, including past extensions if applicable; and (4) the obligor’s willingness to communicate and cooperate on resolving the delinquency. If the collector believes the obligor is a good candidate for an extension, he must obtain approval from his supervisor, who will review the same factors stated above prior to offering the extension to the obligor. After receiving an extension, an account remains subject to our normal policies and procedures for interest accrual, reporting delinquency and recognizing charge-offs.We believe that a prudent extension program is an integral component to mitigating losses in our portfolio of sub-prime automobile receivables. The table below summarizes the status, as of December 31, 2018, for accounts that received extensions from 2008 through 2017:

We view these results as a confirmation of the effectiveness of our extension program. We consider accounts that have had extensions and were active or paid off at December 31, 2018 to be successful. Successful extensions result in continued payments of interest and principal (including payment in full in many cases). Without the extension, however, the account may have defaulted and we would have likely incurred a substantial loss and no additional interest revenue.
 
For extension accounts that ultimately charged off, we consider accounts that charged off more than six months after the extension to be at least partially successful. In such cases, in spite of the ultimate loss, we received additional payments of principal and interest that otherwise we would not have received.
 
Additional information about our extensions is provided in the tables below:

Non-Accrual Receivables
 
It is not uncommon for our obligors to fall behind in their payments. However, with the diligent efforts of our servicing staff and systems for managing our collection efforts, we regularly work with our customers to resolve delinquencies. Our staff is trained to employ a counseling approach to assist our customers with their cash flow management skills and help them to prioritize their payment obligations in order to avoid losing their vehicle to repossession. Through our experience, we have learned that once a contract becomes greater than 90 days past due, it is more likely than not that the delinquency will not be resolved and will ultimately result in a charge-off. As a result, for contracts originated prior to January 2018 that are not accounted for under the fair value method, we do not recognize any interest income for contracts that are greater than 90 days past due.
 
If an obligor exceeds the 90 days past due threshold at the end of one period, and then makes the necessary payments such that it becomes equal to or below 90 days delinquent at the end of a subsequent period, the related contract would be restored to full accrual status for our financial reporting purposes. At the time a contract is restored to full accrual in this manner, there can be no assurance that full repayment of interest and principal will ultimately be made. However, we monitor each obligor’s payment performance and are aware of the severity of his delinquency at any time. The fact that the delinquency has been reduced below the 90-day threshold is a positive indicator. Should the contract again exceed the 90-day delinquency level at the end of any reporting period, it would again be reflected as a non-accrual account.
 
Our policy for placing a contract on non-accrual status is independent of our policy to grant an extension. In practice, it would be an uncommon circumstance where an extension was granted and the account remained in a non-accrual status, since the goal of the extension is to bring the contract current (or nearly current).
 
Securitization of Automobile Contracts
 
Throughout the period for which information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations, and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financings have involved identification of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one of our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securities to be purchased by institutional investors. Depending on the structure, these transactions may be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or as secured financings.
 
When structured to be treated as a secured financing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile contracts and the related debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically (i) recognize interest and fee income on the contracts, (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction and (iii) record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For these receivables, we recognize interest income on a level yield basis using that internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. We do not record an expense for provision for credit losses on these receivables because such credit losses are included in our computation of the appropriate level yield.
 
Since 1994 we have conducted 80 term securitizations of automobile contracts that we originated under our regular programs. As of December 31, 2018, 19 of those securitizations are active and all are structured as secured financings. We have generally conducted our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the end of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. In recent years, we have found that the securitizations we conducted in December of those years, had a tendency toward less investor demand in the related bonds than the securitizations we conducted in other times of the year. As a result, in 2015, we elected to defer what would have been our December securitization in favor of a securitization in January 2016, and since then have conducted our securitizations near the beginning of each calendar quarter.

Our history of term securitizations, over the most recent ten years, is summarized in the table below:
 
Recent Asset-Backed Securitizations
 

Period | Number of Term Securitizations | Amount of Receivables
-------+--------------------------------+----------------------
 | | $ in thousands 
2008 | 2 | 509,022 
2009 | 0 | – 
2010 | 1 | 103,772

2016 | 4 | 1,214,997 
2017 | 4 | 870,000 
2018 | 4 | 883,452 



From time to time we have also completed financings of our residual interests in other securitizations that we and our affiliates previously sponsored. On May 16, 2018, we completed a $40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $40.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in thirteen CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from September 2013 through December 2016, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017. The sold notes (“2018-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 8.595%.
 
Generally, prior to a securitization transaction we fund our automobile contract acquisitions primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities. Our current short-term funding capacity is $300 million, comprising three credit facilities. The first $100 million credit facility was established in May 2012. This facility was most recently renewed in September 2018, extending the revolving period to September 2020, and adding an amortization period through September 2021. In April 2015, we entered into a second $100 million facility. This facility was renewed in April 2017 and again in February 2019, extending the revolving period to February 2021, followed by an amortization period to February 2023. In November 2015, we entered into a third $100 million facility. This facility was renewed in November 2017, extending the revolving period to November 2019, followed by an amortization period to November 2021.
 
In a securitization and in our warehouse credit facilities, we are required to make certain representations and warranties, which are generally similar to the representations and warranties made by dealers in connection with our purchase of the automobile contracts. If we breach any of our representations or warranties, we may be required to repurchase the automobile contract at a price equal to the principal balance plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may then be entitled under the terms of our dealer agreement to require the selling dealer to repurchase the contract at a price equal to our purchase price, less any principal payments made by the customer. Subject to any recourse against dealers, we will bear the risk of loss on repossession and resale of vehicles under automobile contracts that we repurchase.
 
Whether a securitization is treated as a secured financing or as a sale for financial accounting purposes, the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the securitized automobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both our liquidity and results of operations, regardless of whether such automobile contracts are treated as having been sold or as having been financed.

Certain of our securitization transactions and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2018 we were in compliance with all such covenants.
 
Competition
 
The automobile financing business is highly competitive. We compete with a number of national, regional and local finance companies with operations similar to ours. In addition, competitors or potential competitors include other types of financial services companies, such as banks, leasing companies, credit unions providing retail loan financing and lease financing for new and used vehicles, and captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. Many of our competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial, marketing, technical, personnel and other resources than we do. Moreover, our future profitability will be directly related to the availability and cost of our capital in relation to the availability and cost of capital to our competitors. Our competitors and potential competitors include far larger, more established companies that have access to capital markets for unsecured commercial paper and investment grade-rated debt instruments and to other funding sources that may be unavailable to us. Many of these companies also have long-standing relationships with dealers and may provide other financing to dealers, including floor plan financing for the dealers' purchase of automobiles from manufacturers, which we do not offer.
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting a dealer's decision to offer automobile contracts for sale to a particular financing source are the monthly payment amount made available to the dealer’s customer, the purchase price offered for the automobile contracts, the timeliness of the response to the dealer upon submission of the initial application, the amount of required documentation, the consistency and timeliness of purchases and the financial stability of the funding source. While we believe that we can obtain from dealers sufficient automobile contracts for purchase at attractive prices by consistently applying reasonable underwriting criteria and making timely purchases of qualifying automobile contracts, there can be no assurance that we will do so.
 
Regulation
 
Numerous federal and state consumer protection laws, including the federal Truth-In-Lending Act, the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act, regulate consumer credit transactions. These laws mandate certain disclosures with respect to finance charges on automobile contracts and impose certain other restrictions. In most states, a license is required to engage in the business of purchasing automobile contracts from dealers. In addition, laws in a number of states impose limitations on the amount of finance charges that may be charged by dealers on credit sales. The so-called Lemon Laws enacted by various states provide certain rights to purchasers with respect to automobiles that fail to satisfy express warranties. The application of Lemon Laws or violation of such other federal and state laws may give rise to a claim or defense of a customer against a dealer and its assignees, including us and those who purchase automobile contracts from us. The dealer agreement contains representations by the dealer that, as of the date of assignment of automobile contracts, no such claims or defenses have been asserted or threatened with respect to the automobile contracts and that all requirements of such federal and state laws have been complied with in all material respects. Although a dealer would be obligated to repurchase automobile contracts that involve a breach of such warranty, there can be no assurance that the dealer will have the financial resources to satisfy its repurchase obligations. Certain of these laws also regulate our servicing activities, including our methods of collection.
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was enacted in July 2010, and many of its provisions became effective in July 2011. The Dodd-Frank Act restructured the regulation and supervision of the financial services industry and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”). The CFPB has rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over “non-banks,” including us. The CFPB is specifically authorized, among other things, to take actions to prevent companies from engaging in “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts or practices in connection with consumer financial products and services, and to issue rules requiring enhanced disclosures for consumer financial products or services.   The CFPB also has authority to interpret, enforce and issue regulations implementing enumerated consumer laws, including certain laws that apply to us. Further, the CFPB has general supervisory and examination authority over non-depository “larger participants” in the market for automotive finance companies. We are subject to such supervision and examination.

The Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations are likely to affect our cost of doing business, may limit or expand our permissible activities, may affect the competitive balance within our industry and market areas and could have a material adverse effect on us. We continue to assess the Dodd-Frank Act’s probable effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and to monitor developments involving the entities charged with promulgating regulations. However, the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industry in general, and on us in particular, is uncertain at this time.
 
In addition to the CFPB, other state and federal agencies have the ability to regulate aspects of our business. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act provides a mechanism for state Attorneys General to investigate us. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction to investigate aspects of our business. We expect that regulatory investigation by both state and federal agencies will continue, and there can be no assurance that the results of such investigations will not have a material adverse effect on us.
 
We believe that we are currently in material compliance with applicable statutes and regulations; however, there can be no assurance that we are correct, nor that we will be able to maintain such compliance. The past or future failure to comply with applicable statutes and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, the adoption of additional statutes and regulations, changes in the interpretation and enforcement of current statutes and regulations or the expansion of our business into jurisdictions that have adopted more stringent regulatory requirements than those in which we currently conduct business could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, due to the consumer-oriented nature of our industry and the application of certain laws and regulations, industry participants are regularly named as defendants in litigation involving alleged violations of federal and state laws and regulations and consumer law torts, including fraud. Many of these actions involve alleged violations of consumer protection laws. A significant judgment against us or within the industry in connection with any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,032 employees. The breakdown of the employees is as follows: 10 were senior management personnel; 610 were servicing personnel; 215 were automobile contract origination personnel; 132 were marketing personnel and program development (81 of whom were marketing representatives); 65 were various administration personnel including human resources, legal, accounting and systems. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement.
