Item 1. Business
Overview

Lexicon Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company with a mission of pioneering medicines that transform patients’ lives.  We are devoting most of our resources to the commercialization or development of our four most advanced drug programs:

• | We are commercializing XERMELO® (telotristat ethyl), an orally-delivered small molecule drug, in the United States for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome diarrhea in combination with somatostatin analog, or SSA, therapy in adults inadequately controlled by SSA therapy. We have granted Ipsen Pharma SAS, or Ipsen, an exclusive, royalty-bearing right to commercialize XERMELO outside of the United States and Japan. Ipsen is commercializing XERMELO in multiple countries, including the United Kingdom and Germany, and is preparing to commercialize XERMELO in certain additional countries. We are also developing telotristat ethyl as a treatment for biliary tract cancer and are conducting a Phase 2a clinical trial of telotristat ethyl in biliary tract cancer patients. 


• | We are developing sotagliflozin, an orally-delivered small molecule drug candidate, as a treatment for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We have granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH, or Sanofi, an exclusive, worldwide (excluding Japan), royalty-bearing right to develop, manufacture and commercialize sotagliflozin. We have reported positive data from two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials and a third Phase 3 clinical trial of sotagliflozin in type 1 diabetes patients. Sanofi has submitted applications for regulatory approval to market sotagliflozin for type 1 diabetes in the United States, the European Union and certain additional countries, and we and Sanofi are preparing for the commercial launch of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes, if approved. Sanofi is also conducting a comprehensive Phase 3 development program for sotagliflozin in type 2 diabetes. 


• | We are developing LX9211, an orally-delivered small molecule drug candidate, as a treatment for neuropathic pain. We have reported positive top-line data from an initial Phase 1a clinical trial of LX9211 and are conducting a Phase 1b clinical trial of LX9211. 


• | We are developing LX2761, an orally-delivered small molecule drug candidate, as a treatment for diabetes. We have reported top-line data from two Phase 1 clinical trials of LX2761 and are presently evaluating the further clinical development of LX2761. We have granted Sanofi certain rights of first negotiation with respect to the future development and commercialization of LX2761. 

Compounds from our most advanced drug programs, as well as compounds from a number of additional drug discovery and development programs that we have advanced into various stages of clinical and preclinical development, originated from our own internal drug discovery efforts. These efforts were driven by a systematic, target biology-driven approach in which we used gene knockout technologies and an integrated platform of advanced medical technologies to systematically study the physiological and behavioral functions of almost 5,000 genes in mice and assessed the utility of the proteins encoded by the corresponding human genes as potential drug targets. We have identified and validated in living animals, or in vivo, more than 100 targets with promising profiles for drug discovery.
We are working both independently and through strategic collaborations and alliances with third parties to capitalize on our drug target discoveries and drug discovery and development programs. We seek to retain exclusive or co-exclusive rights to the benefits of certain drug discovery and development programs by developing and commercializing drug candidates from those programs internally, particularly in the United States for indications treated by specialist physicians. We seek to collaborate with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as Ipsen and Sanofi, with respect to drug discovery or the development and commercialization of certain of our drug candidates, particularly with respect to commercialization in territories outside the United States, commercialization in the United States for indications treated by primary care physicians, or when the collaboration may otherwise provide us with access to expertise and resources that we do not possess internally or are complementary to our own.

Drug Programs

We are devoting most of our resources to the commercialization or development of our four most advanced drug programs: XERMELO (telotristat ethyl), which we are commercializing for carcinoid syndrome diarrhea and developing for biliary tract cancer; sotagliflozin, which we are developing for type 1 and type 2 diabetes; LX9211, which we are developing for neuropathic pain; and LX2761, which we are developing for diabetes. We have also advanced a number of additional compounds into various stages of clinical and preclinical development.
XERMELO (telotristat ethyl)

We commercially launched XERMELO, an orally-delivered small molecule compound, following regulatory approval in the United States in February 2017 for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome diarrhea in combination with SSA therapy in adults inadequately controlled by SSA therapy. XERMELO was discovered by our scientists and inhibits tryptophan hydroxylase, or TPH, the rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin production found primarily in enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal tract. Carcinoid syndrome is characterized by frequent and debilitating diarrhea and can result when these cells become cancerous and metastisize to the liver or other organs, where they overproduce serotonin. The recommended dose of XERMELO is 250mg three times daily, and the full prescribing information for XERMELO includes certain warnings and precautions relating to constipation.
We have entered into a license and collaboration agreement under which we granted Ipsen an exclusive, royalty-bearing right and license to commercialize XERMELO outside of the United States and Japan. Ipsen has received approval from the European Commission to market XERMELO for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome diarrhea in all member states of the European Union, Norway and Iceland and from certain other regulatory authorities to market XERMELO in additional countries. Ipsen has commercially launched XERMELO in multiple countries, including the United Kingdom and Germany, and is preparing to commercially launch XERMELO in certain additional countries.
As part of our life cycle management of the program, we are conducting a Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of telotristat ethyl and its effects on biliary tract cancer. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 54 patients with unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic biliary tract cancer in an open-label, two-stage study of a 250mg three times daily dose of telotristat ethyl over an initial 7-day treatment period, followed by a 500mg three times daily dose of telotristat ethyl over subsequent 21-day treatment cycles until cessation of treatment for disease progression, toxicity or patient withdrawal. Standard of care, first-line chemotherapy doses of cisplatin and gemcitabine will be administered on days one and eight of each 21-day treatment cycle. The trial is designed to be conducted in two stages, each of which is expected to enroll approximately 27 patients. The primary efficacy endpoint under evaluation is the progression-free survival rate at six months, with secondary endpoints including progression-free survival at 12 months, overall survival rates, disease control rates and weight change.
Sotagliflozin

Sotagliflozin is an orally-delivered small molecule compound that we and Sanofi are developing for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Sotagliflozin was discovered by our scientists and inhibits both sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2, or SGLT2, a transporter responsible for most of the glucose reabsorption performed by the kidney, and sodium-glucose cotransporter type 1, or SGLT1, a transporter responsible for glucose and galactose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Our scientists discovered that mice lacking SGLT1, SGLT2 or both exhibit potent anti-diabetic phenotypes across multiple measures of glucose control and metabolism, and found that compounds inhibiting both targets had a favorable preclinical profile relative to compounds selective for SGLT2.
We have entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi under which we granted Sanofi an exclusive, worldwide (excluding Japan), royalty-bearing right and license to develop, manufacture and commercialize sotagliflozin.
Type 1 Diabetes.
We have completed three Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the safety and tolerability of sotagliflozin and its effects on glycemic parameters associated with type 1 diabetes.

Our pivotal inTandem1 Phase 3 clinical trial enrolled 793 patients with type 1 diabetes in the United States and Canada in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 200mg and 400mg once daily doses of sotagliflozin over a 24-week treatment period, followed by a 28-week extension. Insulin therapy was optimized in patients over a 6-week period prior to dosing. The primary efficacy endpoint under evaluation in the trial was the reduction of hemoglobin A1c, or A1C, versus placebo on optimized insulin treatment at 24 weeks, with secondary endpoints including percentage of patients achieving A1C levels of less than 7% without experiencing an event of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis, or DKA, change in meal-time, or bolus, insulin use, body weight, fasting plasma glucose and patient-reported assessments. Data from the study showed that patients treated with sotagliflozin experienced statistically significant reductions in A1C from baseline of 0.43% for the 200mg dose (p<0.001) and 0.48% for the 400mg dose (p<0.001), as compared to a reduction of 0.07% on placebo after 24 weeks of treatment, meeting the study’s primary efficacy endpoint at both dose levels. The A1C benefit achieved with sotagliflozin was sustained with statistically significant results over the full 52-week duration of the study for both the 200mg and 400mg doses. Benefits in all secondary efficacy endpoints were observed in both the 200mg and 400mg dose arms compared to placebo, with statistically significant improvements in all secondary efficacy endpoints observed in the 400mg dose arm and in the percentage of patients achieving A1C levels of less than 7% without any severe hypoglycemia or DKA events and weight loss observed in the 200mg dose arm and statistically significant improvements in all secondary efficacy endpoints observed in the 400mg dose arm. Over the full 52-week treatment period, the incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events in the placebo, 200mg and 400mg dose arms were 80.6%, 81.7% and 79.8%, respectively; the incidences of serious adverse events were 7.5%, 10.3% and 11.1%, respectively; and the incidences of discontinuation due to adverse events were 4.1%, 4.9% and 6.5%, respectively. Potential cases of severe hypoglycemia and DKA were reviewed by a blinded adjudication panel, which determined whether such cases met pre-established diagnostic criteria. The number of patients with positively adjudicated severe hypoglycemic events during the full 52-week treatment period was 26 (9.7%), 17 (6.5%) and 17 (6.5%) in the placebo, 200mg and 400mg dose arms, respectively. The number of patients with positively adjudicated DKA events during the full 52-week treatment period was 1 (0.4%), 9 (3.4%) and 11 (4.2%) in the placebo, 200mg and 400mg dose arms, respectively.
 Our pivotal inTandem2 Phase 3 clinical trial enrolled 782 patients with type 1 diabetes in Europe and Israel in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 200mg and 400mg once daily doses of sotagliflozin over a 24-week treatment period, followed by a 28-week extension. Insulin therapy was optimized in patients over a 6-week period prior to dosing. As with inTandem1, the primary efficacy endpoint under evaluation in the trial was the reduction of A1C versus placebo on optimized insulin treatment at 24 weeks, with secondary endpoints including percentage of patients achieving A1C levels of less than 7% without experiencing a severe hypoglycemia or DKA event, change in bolus insulin use, body weight, fasting plasma glucose and patient-reported assessments. Data from the study showed that patients treated with sotagliflozin experienced statistically significant reductions in A1C from baseline of 0.39% for the 200mg dose (p<0.001) and 0.37% for the 400mg dose (p<0.001), as compared to a reduction of 0.02% on placebo after 24 weeks of treatment, meeting the study’s primary efficacy endpoint at both dose levels. The A1C benefit achieved with sotagliflozin was sustained with statistically significant results over the full 52-week duration of the study for both the 200mg and 400mg doses. Statistically significant improvements in all secondary efficacy endpoints were observed in both the 200mg and 400mg dose arms compared to placebo. Over the full 52-week treatment period, the incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events in the placebo, 200mg and 400mg dose arms were 61.2%, 68.2% and 68.8%, respectively; the incidences of serious adverse events were 6.6%, 10.0% and 8.0%, respectively; and the incidences of discontinuation due to adverse events were 3.5%, 3.8% and 6.8%, respectively. Potential cases of severe hypoglycemia and DKA were reviewed by a blinded adjudication panel, which determined whether such cases met pre-established diagnostic criteria. The number of patients with positively adjudicated severe hypoglycemic events during the full 52-week treatment period was 13 (5.0%), 13 (5.0%) and 6 (2.3%) in the placebo, 200mg and 400mg dose arms, respectively. The number of patients with positively adjudicated DKA events during the full 52-week treatment period was 0 (0.0%), 6 (2.3%) and 9 (3.4%) in the placebo, 200mg and 400mg dose arms, respectively.
We have additionally reported pooled continuous glucose monitoring, or CGM, data from the inTandem1 and inTandem2 clinical trials. The percentage of time during the initial 24-week treatment period spent inside the target range for CGM glucose (70-180 mg/dL) increased from 52.2% to 57.8% in patients treated with 200mg of sotagliflozin and from 50.7% to 64.1% in patients treated with 400mg of sotagliflozin, with no relevant change observed in patients receiving placebo. The differences from placebo were clinically significant for both the 200mg and 400mg dose groups (p=0.026 and p<0.001, respectively). The increase in time spent in range by both sotagliflozin dose groups was a result of significantly reduced time spent above 180 mg/dL, while the time spent below 70 mg/dL was not increased. These results translate into an additional 1.41 hours and 3.02 hours that a patient would spend within the 70-180 mg/dL target range in a 24-hour period, for the 200mg and 400mg dose groups respectively.
Our inTandem3 Phase 3 clinical trial enrolled 1,405 patients with type 1 diabetes in the United States and Europe in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a 400mg once daily dose of sotagliflozin over a 24-week treatment period. Insulin therapy was not optimized in patients and eligibility criteria included any background insulin therapy. The 
 3

primary efficacy endpoint under evaluation in the trial was the proportion of patients achieving A1C levels of less than 7% at 24 weeks without experiencing a severe hypoglycemic or DKA event, with secondary endpoints including the change from baseline in A1C, body weight, systolic blood pressure and bolus insulin use. Data from the study showed statistically significant superiority of sotagliflozin (28.6%) compared to placebo (15.2%) in the proportion of patients achieving A1C levels of less than 7% without experiencing a severe hypoglycemic or DKA event (p<0.001), meeting the study’s primary endpoint. Patients treated with sotagliflozin also experienced statistically significant improvements in all secondary efficacy endpoints compared to placebo. The incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events in the placebo and 400mg dose arms were 52.5% and 55.1%, respectively; the incidences of serious adverse events were 3.3% and 6.9%, respectively; and the incidences of discontinuation due to adverse events were 2.3% and 6.3%, respectively. Potential cases of severe hypoglycemia and DKA were reviewed by a blinded adjudication panel, which determined whether such cases met pre-established diagnostic criteria. The number of patients with positively adjudicated severe hypoglycemic events during the 24-week treatment period was 17 (2.4%) and 21 (3.0%) in the placebo and 400mg dose arms, respectively. The number of patients with positively adjudicated DKA events during the 24-week treatment period was 4 (0.6%) and 21 (3.0%) in the placebo and 400mg dose arms, respectively. Results from the inTandem3 trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2017.
Sanofi has submitted applications for regulatory approval to market sotagliflozin for type 1 diabetes in the United States, the European Union and certain additional countries. On January 17, 2019, the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, voted eight to eight on the question of whether the overall benefits of sotagliflozin outweighed the risks to support approval. While the FDA is not required to follow the committee’s vote, the FDA considers the committee’s recommendations when making its decision on the United States application, which is anticipated by March 22, 2019 under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act.
On February 28, 2019, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use adopted a positive opinion recommending regulatory approval of sotagliflozin for use as an adjunct to insulin therapy to improve glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes with a body mass index of 27 kg/m2 or greater, who have failed to achieve adequate glycemic control despite optimal insulin therapy. The European Commission is anticipated to make a final decision on the European Union application in the second quarter of 2019.

We and Sanofi are working with the FDA, EMA and other regulatory authorities in support of their review process and preparing for the commercial launch of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes, if approved. 
Type 2 Diabetes.
Sanofi is conducting a comprehensive Phase 3 development program for sotagliflozin in type 2 diabetes patients, including the following randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies:

• | 200mg and 400mg once daily doses of sotagliflozin as monotherapy in approximately 400 patients over a 26-week treatment period;


• | 400mg once daily dose of sotagliflozin in approximately 500 patients on background metformin therapy over a 26-week treatment period, followed by a 53-week extension;


• | 400mg once daily dose of sotagliflozin in approximately 500 patients added to sulfonylurea alone or in combination with metformin over a 26-week treatment period, followed by a 53-week extension;


• | 200mg or 400mg once daily dose of sotagliflozin in approximately 10,500 patients with cardiovascular risk factors and moderately impaired renal function over a treatment period to be determined by cardiovascular outcome events, currently expected to be approximately four years;


• | 200mg and 400mg once daily doses of sotagliflozin in approximately 780 patients with moderate renal impairment over a 52-week treatment period;


• | 200mg and 400mg once daily doses of sotagliflozin in approximately 276 patients with severe renal impairment over a 52-week treatment period;


• | 200mg and 400mg once daily doses of sotagliflozin in approximately 560 patients on background basal insulin alone or in addition to other oral antidiabetic drug therapies over an 18-week treatment period, followed by a 34-week extension;

• | 200mg and 400mg once daily doses of sotagliflozin in approximately 700 patients on dipeptidyl peptidase-4, or DPP-4, inhibitors, with or without metformin, compared to 25mg dose of empagliflozin over a 26-week treatment period;


• | 200mg and 400mg once daily doses of sotagliflozin in approximately 930 patients on background metformin therapy compared to up to a 6mg dose of glimepiride over a 52-week treatment period;


• | 200mg and 400mg once daily doses of sotagliflozin in approximately 360 patients aged 55 years or older, with or without any stable anti-diabetes therapy, evaluating efficacy and bone safety over a 26-week treatment period, followed by a 78-week extension; and


• | 200mg or 400mg once daily doses of sotagliflozin in approximately 4,000 hemodynamically stable patients with type 2 diabetes post-worsening heart failure over a treatment period determined by cardiovascular outcome events, currently expected to be approximately three years.

We previously completed two Phase 2 clinical trials evaluating the safety and tolerability of sotagliflozin and its effects on glycemic parameters associated with type 2 diabetes.
The Phase 2b clinical trial enrolled 299 patients with type 2 diabetes who were not adequately controlled on metformin monotherapy in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 75mg once daily, 200mg once daily, 200mg twice daily and 400mg once daily doses of sotagliflozin, each administered in combination with standard metformin therapy over a 12‑week treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint under evaluation in the trial was the change in A1C from baseline to week 12. Secondary efficacy endpoints included percentage of patients achieving A1C levels of less than 7%, as well as changes in fasting plasma glucose levels, weight, blood pressure and triglyceride levels. Data from the study showed that treatment with sotagliflozin demonstrated statistically significant benefits in the primary and multiple secondary endpoints. Patients in each of the 75mg once daily, 200mg once daily, 200mg twice daily and 400mg once daily sotagliflozin treatment arms had mean A1C reductions from baseline of 0.43, 0.52, 0.79 and 0.92 percent, respectively (p<0.001 for all treatment arms), while in patients randomized to placebo, A1C decreased by 0.09 percent. We also observed that patients treated with sotagliflozin showed significant reductions in body weight and blood pressure. Sotagliflozin was well tolerated and adverse events were generally mild to moderate, with the overall incidence of adverse events with sotagliflozin being similar to placebo.
The Phase 2a clinical trial enrolled 36 patients with non-insulin dependent type 2 diabetes in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 150mg and 300mg doses of sotagliflozin, each administered once daily over a four-week treatment period. The efficacy endpoints under evaluation in the trial included urinary glucose excretion, fasting plasma glucose, response to oral glucose tolerance testing, and change in A1C. Data from the study showed that treatment with 150mg and 300mg of sotagliflozin provided improvements in glycemic control and demonstrated statistically significant benefits in the primary and multiple secondary efficacy endpoints. A marked and statistically significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose was observed at each measurement point throughout the treatment period in both treatment arms relative to placebo. After four weeks of dosing, patients in both dose groups exhibited statistically significant reductions in A1C as compared to patients receiving placebo (p=0.001 and p<0.001 for the 150mg and 300mg treatment arms, respectively). Patients in both treatment arms also exhibited statistically significant improvements in glucose tolerance in response to oral glucose tolerance testing (p<0.001 for both treatment arms). Consistent with the mechanism of action of sotagliflozin, there was also a significant, dose-dependent increase in 24-hour urinary glucose excretion in both treatment arms at each measurement point throughout the study period relative to placebo (p<0.001 at all time points measured). Patients in both treatment arms also showed positive trends in broader metabolic and cardiovascular parameters, including weight reduction, decreased blood pressure and lower triglyceride levels. Sotagliflozin was well tolerated in the trial, with no dose-limiting toxicities observed and adverse events being generally mild and equally distributed across all treatment groups, including the placebo group.
LX9211
LX9211 is an orally-delivered small molecule compound that we are developing for the treatment of neuropathic pain. LX9211 was discovered by scientists working within our drug discovery alliance with Bristol-Myers Squibb and inhibits adaptor associated kinase 1, or AAK1. Our scientists discovered that mice lacking AAK1 exhibit increased resistance to induced neuropathic pain in preclinical models.
We reported top-line data in December 2018 from a Phase 1a clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of LX9211. The trial enrolled ten cohorts of healthy volunteers in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending single dose study of daily doses of LX9211. LX9211 demonstrated a safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics profile identifying the maximum tolerated dose and supportive of once daily, or less frequent, dosing. 
 5

Pharmacokinetics results were dose proportional over substantially all of the dose range. The most common adverse event was headache and there were no drug-related serious adverse events.
We are conducting a Phase 1b clinical trial further evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of LX9211. The trial is expected to enroll up to 40 healthy volunteers in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending multiple dose study of daily doses of LX9211 over a 14-day treatment period.
We have obtained exclusive research, development and commercialization rights to LX9211 and additional compounds acting through AAK1 from Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
LX2761
LX2761 is an orally-delivered small molecule compound that we are developing for the treatment of diabetes. LX2761 was discovered by our scientists and is designed to inhibit SGLT1 locally in the gastrointestinal tract without any significant inhibition of SGLT2 in the kidney.
We reported top-line data in December 2018 from two Phase 1 clinical trials evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of LX2761. The Phase 1a trial enrolled five cohorts of healthy volunteers and two cohorts of type 2 diabetes patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending single dose study of daily doses of LX2761. Patients with type 2 diabetes were washed off metformin for three days prior to dosing. LX2761 demonstrated minimal absorption and no systemic effect, with no increase in urine glucose excretion from baseline. LX2761 also reduced postprandial glucose in diabetic patients while increasing plasma levels of glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, a hormone produced in the small intestine that stimulates insulin secretion and inhibits glucagon secretion. The most common adverse and dose-limiting event was diarrhea.
The Phase 1b trial enrolled 51 patients with type 2 diabetes in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled ascending multiple dose study of daily doses of LX2761, administered as a single dose or twice per day over an 8-day treatment period. Patients were treated with metformin at the time of screening and for the duration of the study. LX2761 showed reduced postprandial glucose, demonstrating delayed and reduced intestinal glucose absorption while increasing plasma levels of GLP-1 with minimal effect on urinary glucose excretion. The most common adverse event was diarrhea. We are presently evaluating the further clinical development of LX2761.
We have granted Sanofi certain rights of first negotiation with respect to the future development and commercialization of LX2761.
Drug Target Discoveries
Our internal drug discovery efforts were driven by a systematic, target biology-driven approach in which we used gene knockout technologies and an integrated platform of advanced medical technologies to systematically study the physiological and behavioral functions of almost 5,000 genes in mice and assessed the utility of the proteins encoded by the corresponding human genes as potential drug targets. We have identified and validated in living animals, or in vivo, more than 100 targets with promising profiles for drug discovery.
Collaborations

We are working both independently and through strategic collaborations and alliances with third parties to capitalize on our drug target discoveries and drug discovery and development programs. Consistent with this approach, we seek to retain exclusive rights to the benefits of certain drug discovery and development programs by developing and commercializing drug candidates from those programs internally, particularly in the United States for indications treated by specialist physicians, as we have with XERMELO in the United States. We seek to collaborate with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as Ipsen and Sanofi, with respect to drug discovery or the development and commercialization of certain of our drug candidates, particularly with respect to commercialization in territories outside the United States, commercialization in the United States for indications treated by primary care physicians, or when the collaboration may provide us with access to expertise and resources that we do not possess internally or are complementary to our own. We also seek to collaborate with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, research institutes and academic institutions to capitalize on our drug target discoveries.

Strategic Collaborations
Sanofi. We entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi in November 2015 under which we granted Sanofi an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing right and license to develop, manufacture and commercialize sotagliflozin. In December 2016, Sanofi terminated its rights under the agreement with respect to Japan. We received a $300 million upfront payment under the agreement and we are eligible to receive up to $210 million upon the achievement of specified clinical development milestones, up to $220 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones and up to $990 million upon the achievement of specified commercial milestones. We are also entitled to tiered, escalating royalties ranging from low double digit percentages to 40 percent of net sales of sotagliflozin, based on indication and territory, with royalties for the higher band of such range attributable to net sales for type 1 diabetes in the United States, and subject in each case to customary royalty reduction provisions. 
We are responsible for all clinical development activities relating to type 1 diabetes and have exercised an exclusive option to co-promote and have a significant role, in collaboration with Sanofi, in the commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in the United States. Under the terms of the exercised co-promotion option, we will fund 40 percent of the commercialization costs relating to such co-promotion activities. Sanofi is responsible for all clinical development and commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes worldwide and is solely responsible for the commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes outside the United States. We shared in the funding of a portion of the planned type 2 diabetes development costs over the first three years of the collaboration, up to an aggregate of $100 million, which was satisfied in 2018. Sanofi will book sales worldwide in all indications.
Ipsen. We entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Ipsen in October 2014 under which we granted Ipsen an exclusive, royalty-bearing right and license to commercialize XERMELO outside of the United States, Canada and Japan. The collaboration was expanded in March 2015 to include Canada. We have received $24.5 million in upfront payments and $20.5 million in regulatory and commercial launch milestones under the agreement. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to an additional $11.8 million upon the achievement of additional specified regulatory and commercial launch milestones and up to €72 million upon the achievement of specified sales milestones. We are also entitled to tiered, escalating royalties ranging from low twenties to mid-thirties percentages of net sales of XERMELO in the licensed territory, subject to a credit for Ipsen’s payments to us for the manufacture and supply of such units of XERMELO and customary royalty reduction provisions.

Bristol-Myers Squibb.  We established a drug discovery alliance with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in December 2003 to discover, develop and commercialize small molecule drugs in the neuroscience field.  Bristol-Myers Squibb extended the target discovery term of the alliance in May 2006.  We initiated the alliance with a number of neuroscience drug discovery programs at various stages of development and used our gene knockout technologies to identify additional drug targets with promise in the neuroscience field.  For those targets that were selected for the alliance, we and Bristol-Myers Squibb worked together, on an exclusive basis, to identify, characterize and carry out the preclinical development of small molecule drugs. Bristol-Myers Squibb has the first option to assume full responsibility for clinical development and commercialization of any drugs resulting from the alliance which enter clinical trials, other than LX9211 and additional compounds acting through AAK1. We received $86 million in upfront payments and research funding under the agreement during the target discovery portion of the alliance, which expired in October 2009. In addition, we are entitled to receive clinical and regulatory milestone payments ranging, depending on the timing and extent of our efforts in the alliance, up to $76 million for each drug developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb under the alliance.  We will also earn royalties on sales of drugs commercialized by Bristol-Myers Squibb under the alliance.
We jointly developed LX9211 with Bristol-Myers Squibb as part of the alliance, and separately obtained from Bristol-Myers Squibb exclusive research, development and commercialization rights to LX9211 and additional compounds acting through AAK1. We have agreed to pay Bristol-Myers Squibb up to $34.5 million in clinical and regulatory milestones for the first indication and up to $16 million in clinical and regulatory milestones for each of the second and third indications, if applicable. We have also agreed to pay single digit royalties on worldwide net sales and up to $40 million in commercial milestones.
Genentech.  We established a drug discovery alliance with Genentech, Inc. in December 2002 to discover novel therapeutic proteins and antibody targets.  We and Genentech expanded the alliance in November 2005 for the advanced research, development and commercialization of new biotherapeutic drugs.  Under the original alliance agreement, we used our target validation technologies to discover the functions of secreted proteins and potential antibody targets identified through Genentech’s internal drug discovery research.  In the expanded alliance, we conducted additional, advanced research on a broad subset of those proteins and targets.  We have exclusive rights to develop and commercialize biotherapeutic drugs for two of these targets, while Genentech has exclusive rights to develop and commercialize biotherapeutic drugs for the other targets.  We 
 7

retain certain other rights to discoveries made in the alliance, including non-exclusive rights, along with Genentech, for the development and commercialization of small molecule drugs addressing the targets included in the alliance. We received $58 million in upfront payments, research funding and research milestone payments under the agreement during the research collaboration term, which expired in November 2008.  In addition, we are entitled to receive clinical and regulatory milestone payments ranging, depending on the extent of our efforts in the alliance, up to $25 million for each drug target for which Genentech develops a biotherapeutic drug under the alliance.  We will also earn royalties on sales of biotherapeutic drugs commercialized by Genentech under the alliance.  Genentech is entitled to receive milestone payments and royalties on sales of biotherapeutic drugs which we develop or commercialize under the alliance.
Other Collaborations
We have established collaborations with a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, research institutes and academic institutions under which we have received fees in exchange for generating knockout mice for genes requested by the collaborator, providing phenotypic data with respect to such knockout mice or otherwise granting access to some of our technologies and discoveries.  In some cases, we remain eligible to receive milestone or royalty payments on the sale of mice and phenotypic data or on products that our collaborators discover or develop using our technology.
Manufacturing and Product Supply

We do not own or operate manufacturing or distribution facilities or resources for clinical or commercial production and distribution of XERMELO or any of our drug candidates. Instead, we have multiple contractual agreements in place with third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, who, on our behalf, manufacture commercial supplies of XERMELO and clinical supplies of our drug candidates, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Sanofi is responsible for the manufacture of all clinical and commercial supplies of sotagliflozin under the terms of our collaboration. We have selected well-established and reputable global CMOs for our active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and drug product manufacturing that have good regulatory standing, large manufacturing capacities, and multiple manufacturing sites within their business footprint. We employ highly skilled personnel with both technical and manufacturing experience to diligently manage the activities at our CMOs. Our quality department audits these suppliers on a periodic basis. Our commercial suppliers are subject to routine inspections by regulatory agencies. We work closely with our third-party manufacturers to ensure compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and other stringent regulatory requirements enforced by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies in other territories, as applicable.
Raw materials that are used to manufacture our API are sourced from multiple third-party suppliers in Asia and Europe. Third-party API contract manufacturers in Asia and Europe stock sufficient quantities of these materials to ensure they can manufacture adequate API quantities per our requirements, for both clinical and commercial purposes. We store API at third-party facilities, and provide appropriate amounts to third-party drug product contract manufacturers in Asia and North America who then manufacture, package and label our specified quantities of finished goods for XERMELO and our drug candidates. We rely on sole source third-party drug product contract manufacturers in the United States to manufacture, package and label finished drug product for commercial distribution of XERMELO. We also rely on a single third-party logistics provider, with two distribution locations, to provide shipping and warehousing services for our commercial supply of XERMELO in the United States. Our third-party contract manufacturers also need to obtain materials such as excipients, components and reagents to manufacture our API and finished drug products.
Within our supply chain, we have established safety stock amounts for both our API and drug products, and store those quantities for XERMELO in multiple locations. The quantities that we store are based on our business needs and take into account scenarios for demand, production lead times, potential supply interruptions and shelf life for our API and drug products. In parallel, for business continuity reasons, we have established a backup supplier for our API and are in the process of evaluating and expect to establish an additional or backup supplier for our drug product in the near future. We believe that our current manufacturing network has the appropriate capacity to produce sufficient commercial quantities of XERMELO for both our and Ipsen’s commercialization efforts in support of the current approved indication of carcinoid syndrome diarrhea, as well as the potential indication of biliary tract cancer, if clinical development in that indication proves to be successful and gains regulatory approval in the future.
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
We have a fully integrated commercial team consisting of sales, marketing, market access, and commercial operations functions. Our specialized sales team promotes XERMELO in the United States, concentrating their efforts on oncologists, oncology nurses and pharmacists. We have also built an internal medical affairs function with responsibility for responding to external inquiries regarding the appropriate use of XERMELO with regularly updated and well-substantiated scientific and 
 8

medical information.  We have contracted with two independent specialty pharmacies to dispense XERMELO and provide specialty pharmacy services in fulfillment of prescriptions in the United States, allowing for efficient delivery of XERMELO by mail directly to patients. We rely on Ipsen for the commercialization and distribution of XERMELO in territories outside of the United States.
To help ensure that all eligible patients in the United States have appropriate access to XERMELO, we have established a comprehensive reimbursement and support program called LexCares. Through LexCares, we provide co-pay assistance to qualified, commercially insured patients to help minimize out-of-pocket costs and provide free drug to uninsured or under-insured patients who meet certain clinical and financial criteria. In addition, LexCares is designed to provide comprehensive reimbursement support services, such as benefits investigation and, if needed, appeals support.
Competition

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change.  We face significant competition in each of the aspects of our business from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic research institutions, clinical reference laboratories and governmental agencies that are pursuing research or development activities similar to ours. Many of our competitors have substantially greater research, development and commercialization capabilities and financial, scientific, marketing and human resources than we do.  As a result, our competitors may succeed in developing products earlier than we do, obtaining approvals from the FDA or other regulatory agencies for those products more rapidly than we do, developing products that are more effective than those we develop or commercializing products more effectively and profitably than we do.  Similarly, our collaborators face similar competition from other competitors who may succeed in developing products more quickly, developing products that are more effective than those developed by our collaborators or commercialize products more effectively and profitably than our collaborators.
The competition for our products and drug candidates includes both marketed products and drug candidates that are being developed by others, including pharmaceutical products that are currently in a more advanced stage of clinical development or commercialization than are our own drug candidates.  These competitive marketed products and drug candidates include compounds that employ different mechanisms of action in addressing diseases and conditions for which we are developing our own drug candidates and, in some cases such as sotagliflozin, that employ the same or similar mechanisms of action.

We believe that our ability to successfully compete with these potentially competitive drug candidates and other competitive products currently on the market will depend on, among other things:


• | the efficacy, safety and reliability of our products;


• | our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to complete preclinical and clinical development and obtain regulatory approvals for our drug candidates;


• | the timing and scope of regulatory approvals of our products;


• | our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to obtain product acceptance by physicians and other health care providers and secure coverage and adequate reimbursement for product use in approved indications;


• | our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to manufacture and sell commercial quantities of our products;


• | the skills of our employees and our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees;


• | protection of our intellectual property; and


• | the availability of substantial capital resources to fund development and commercialization activities.

Our principal competition for XERMELO includes the use, above their maximum labeled dose, of the established SSA therapies octreotide and lanreotide, injectable products currently marketed by Novartis and Ipsen, respectively, as well as lutetium Lu 177 dotatate, a radiopharmaceutical product currently marketed for the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors by Advanced Accelerator Applications (a subsidiary of Novartis).
 9

If approved for the treatment of type 1 diabetes, we expect that our principal competition for sotagliflozin will include established insulin therapies, as well as selective SGLT2 inhibitors currently being prescribed off-label, but which may gain regulatory approval, for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Such selective SGLT2 inhibitors include dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and canagliflozin, currently marketed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes by AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly, and Janssen (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), respectively. The EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has adopted a positive opinion recommending regulatory approval for AstraZeneca to market dapagliflozin for the treatment of insufficiently controlled type 1 diabetes as an adjunct to insulin in adult patients with a body mass index of 27 kg/m2 or greater, when insulin alone does not provide adequate glycaemic control despite optimal insulin therapy. If approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, we expect that our principal competition for sotagliflozin will include such selective SGLT2 inhibitors, as well as DPP-4 inhibitors such as sitagliptin, currently marketed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes by Merck.

Government Regulation

The development, manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by United States and foreign governmental authorities, including federal, state and local authorities.  In the United States, new drugs are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or the FDC Act.  The FDA and comparable governmental authorities regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, efficacy, record keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, export and import of pharmaceutical products.

The standard process required by the FDA before a drug candidate may be marketed in the United States generally includes the following:


• | preclinical laboratory and animal tests performed under current good laboratory practices, or cGLP;


• | submission of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence;


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for its intended use;


• | submission of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for approval of commercial marketing and sale, or of an NDA supplement, or sNDA, for approval of a new indication if the product is already approved for another indication;


• | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with cGMP and current good clinical practices, or cGCP;


• | if FDA convenes an advisory committee, satisfactory completion of the advisory committee review; and


• | FDA approval of the NDA or sNDA.

     This process for the testing and approval of drug candidates requires substantial time, effort and financial resources.  Preclinical development of a drug candidate can take from one to several years to complete, with no guarantee that an IND based on those studies will become effective to even permit clinical testing to begin.  Before commencing the first clinical trial of a drug candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA.  The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial.  In such a case, we and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial may begin.  Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development, and the FDA must grant permission for each clinical trial to start and continue.  Further, an independent institutional review board for each medical center proposing to participate in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center.  Regulatory authorities or an institutional review board or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.

For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.


• | Phase 1 clinical trials are conducted in a limited number of healthy human volunteers or, in some cases, patients, to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion of the drug candidate;


• | Phase 2 clinical trials are conducted in groups of patients afflicted with a specified disease or condition to obtain preliminary data regarding efficacy as well as to further evaluate safety and optimize dosing of the drug candidate.

 10

Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials; and

• | Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted in larger patient populations at multiple clinical trial sites to obtain statistically significant evidence of the efficacy of the drug candidate for its intended use and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population.

In addition, the FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved.  These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after a drug receives approval. Failure to satisfy such post-marketing commitments can result in FDA enforcement action, up and to including withdrawal of NDA approval. The results of phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a drug candidate and can provide important safety information to augment the FDA’s adverse drug reaction reporting system.
After completion of clinical trials, FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a new drug may be marketed in the United States.  The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. An NDA must contain, among other things, information on chemistry, manufacturing controls and potency and purity, non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology, human pharmacokinetics and bioavailability and clinical data.  There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept an NDA for filing and, even if accepted for filing, that approval will be granted.  The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on NDA review questions. Although the FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of an advisory committee, the agency typically does so. Among other things, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency.  The FDA may deny approval of an NDA by way of a Complete Response letter if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical data or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial.  Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.  An NDA may be approved with significant restrictions on its labeling, marketing and distribution under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy or otherwise that could restrict the commercial applications of a product or impose costly procedures in connection with the commercialization or use of the product. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory standards are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market.  In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each product, each drug manufacturing establishment must be inspected and approved by the FDA.  All manufacturing establishments are subject to inspections by the FDA and by other federal, state and local agencies and must comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices requirements.  Non-compliance with these requirements can result in, among other things, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the government to grant approval for marketing and withdrawal, suspension or revocation of marketing approvals.
Satisfaction of FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically takes many years, with the actual time required varying substantially based on, among other things, the nature, novelty and complexity of the drug candidate and of the disease or condition.  Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of drug candidates or new diseases for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. The FDA or any other regulatory agency may not grant approvals for new indications for our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all. Success in earlier-stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later-stage clinical trials.  Targets and pathways identified in vitro may be determined to be less relevant in clinical studies and results in animal model studies may not be predictive of human clinical results. Furthermore, data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Even if a drug candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.

Once the FDA approves a product, a manufacturer must provide certain updated safety and efficacy information.  Product changes as well as certain changes in a manufacturing process or facility would necessitate additional FDA review and approval.  Other post-approval changes may also necessitate further FDA review and approval.  Additionally, a manufacturer must meet other requirements including those related to adverse event reporting and record keeping.

Products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic 
 11

unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs, including restricting the promotion of uses for which a drug is not approved by the agency.  Not only must a company have appropriate substantiation to support claims made about a drug, under the FDA’s current interpretation of relevant laws, a company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are for indications for which FDA has approved the drug and are otherwise consistent with the FDA-approved label for the drug.  Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturers’ communications on the subject of off-label use. Additionally, a significant number of pharmaceutical companies have been the target of inquiries and investigations by various United States federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities in connection with the promotion of products for off-label uses and other sales practices. These investigations have alleged violations of various United States federal and state laws and regulations, including claims asserting antitrust violations, violations of the FDC Act, false claims laws, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, anti-kickback laws, and other alleged violations in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses, pricing and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement.
The United States Orphan Drug Act is intended to incentivize the development of products for rare diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. If a drug is being developed for a rare disease or condition, to be eligible for designation as an orphan drug, the FDA must not have previously approved a drug considered the “same drug” for the same orphan indication. If the FDA has previously approved another same drug for the same indication, the sponsor of the subsequent drug would be required to provide a plausible hypotheses of clinical superiority over the previously approved drug to obtain an orphan designation. Upon FDA receipt of orphan drug designation, the sponsor is eligible for tax credits of up to 25% for qualified clinical trial expenses, the ability to apply for annual grant funding and waiver of PDUFA application fee. In addition, upon marketing approval, an orphan-designated drug could be eligible for seven years of market exclusivity for the approved orphan-designated indication. Such orphan drug exclusivity, if awarded, would only block the approval of any drug considered the same drug for the same orphan indication. Moreover, a subsequent same drug could break a previously approved drug’s orphan exclusivity through a demonstration of clinical superiority over the previously approved drug.
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for developing and reviewing promising drugs, or to provide for the approval of a drug on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to give drugs that treat serious conditions and offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months of NDA filing as compared to a standard review time of 10 months from NDA filing. Certain other types of drug applications are also eligible for priority review. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track-designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that fills an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to confirm the clinically meaningful outcome as predicted by the surrogate marker trial. In addition to the Fast Track, accelerated approval and priority review programs, the FDA also designates Breakthrough Therapy status to drugs that are intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review and rolling review.
Additional programs intended to expedite the development of drug products were included in the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act. The Cures Act includes various provisions to accelerate the development and delivery of new treatments, such as those intended to expand the types of evidence manufacturers may bring to the FDA to support drug 
 12

approval, to encourage patient-centered drug development, to liberalize the communication of healthcare economic information to payers, and to create greater transparency with regard to manufacturer expanded access programs. Central to the Cures Act are provisions that enhance and accelerate the FDA’s processes for reviewing and approving new drugs and supplements to approved NDAs, including provisions that:

• | require the FDA to establish a program to evaluate the potential use of real world evidence to help support the approval of a new indication for an approved drug and to help support or satisfy post-approval study requirements;


• | provide that the FDA may rely upon qualified data summaries to support the approval of a supplemental application with respect to a qualified indication for an already approved drug;


• | require the FDA to issue guidance for purposes of assisting sponsors in incorporating complex adaptive and other novel trial designs into proposed clinical protocols and applications for new drugs; and


• | require the FDA to establish a process for the qualification of drug development tools for use in supporting or obtaining FDA approval for or investigational use of a drug.

The Cures Act amends Section 114 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 to help clarify and facilitate the dissemination of healthcare economic information, including by broadening the definition of healthcare economic information, expressly extending the dissemination of healthcare economic information to payors, and clarifying that healthcare economic information must only relate to an FDA-approved indication rather than directly relate to the indication.

Regulation Outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to the regulations of other countries governing clinical trials and the manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of our products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications, or MAAs, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. Under the centralized procedure, MAAs are submitted to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, whose Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use reviews the application and issues an opinion on it. The opinion is considered by the European Commission which is responsible for deciding applications. If the application is approved, the European Commission grants a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, or the EEA. The national authorization procedures, the decentralized and mutual recognition procedures, as well as national applications, are available for products for which the centralized procedure is not compulsory. The mutual recognition procedure provides for the European Union member states selected by the applicant to mutually recognize a national marketing authorization that has already been granted by the competent authority of another member state, referred to as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The decentralized procedure is used when the product in question has yet to be granted a marketing authorization in any member state. Under this procedure the applicant can select the member state that will act as the RMS. In both the mutual recognition and decentralized procedures, the RMS reviews the application and submits its assessment of the application to the member states where marketing authorizations are being sought, referred to as Concerned Member States or CMS. Within 90 days of receiving the application and assessment report, each CMS must decide whether to recognize the RMS assessment. If a member state does not agree with the assessment, and the disputed points cannot be resolved the matter is eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. If the application is successful national marketing authorizations will be granted by the competent authorities in each of the member states chosen by the applicant.
Conditional marketing authorizations may be granted for a limited number of medicinal products for human use referenced in European Union law applicable to conditional marketing authorizations where the clinical dataset is not comprehensive, if the risk-benefit balance of the product is positive, it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, unmet medical needs will be fulfilled and the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Specific obligations, such as the completion of ongoing or new studies and obligations relating to the collection of pharmacovigilance data, may be amongst the conditions stipulated in the marketing authorization.
 13

As in the United States, we may apply for designation of a product as an Orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made. In the European Union, orphan designation is available for products in development which are either intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, or intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the community and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. Additionally, the sponsor of an application for orphan drug designation must establish that there exists no satisfactory authorized method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition or even if such treatment exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
Orphan drugs in the European Union enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product. The period of market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if at the end of the fifth year it is established that the criteria for orphan designation are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.

Healthcare Regulation
Federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, also apply to our business. If we fail to comply with those laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits. among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent. Additionally, we are subject to state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of whether the payer is a federal healthcare program, and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicate compliance efforts.
Numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. In addition, most healthcare providers who are expected to prescribe our products and from whom we obtain patient health information, are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity, including healthcare providers, in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states requiring security breach notification. These laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business. International laws, such as the EU Data Privacy Directive and Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, regulate the processing of personal data within the European Union and between countries in the European Union and countries outside of the European Union, including the United States. Failure to provide adequate privacy protections and maintain compliance with safe harbor mechanisms could jeopardize business transactions across borders and result in significant penalties.
In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the PPACA, created a federal requirement under the federal Open Payments program, that requires certain manufacturers to track and report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, annually certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year. In addition, there are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
For those marketed products which are covered in the United States by the Medicaid program, we have various obligations, including government price reporting and rebate requirements, which generally require products be offered at substantial rebates/discounts to Medicaid and certain purchasers. We are also required to discount such products to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, under which additional laws and requirements 
 14

apply. These programs require submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and the guidance governing such calculations is not always clear. Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources, but failure to properly calculate our prices, or offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial penalties.
Other Regulations

In addition to the foregoing, our business is subject to regulation under various state and federal environmental laws, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act.  These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in and wastes generated by our operations.  We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that our continued compliance with these laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business.  We cannot predict, however, whether new regulatory restrictions will be imposed by state or federal regulators and agencies or whether existing laws and regulations will adversely affect us in the future.
Patents and Proprietary Rights

We are able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that those rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. Accordingly, patents and other proprietary rights are an essential element of our business.  We own or exclusively license patents and/or patent applications throughout the world that claim our products and drug candidates, including:

• | issued patents and pending patent applications in Europe, the United States, and other countries throughout the world, including Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, and South Korea, that claim telotristat ethyl and associated crystalline forms, pharmaceutical compositions comprising telotristat ethyl, and methods of its manufacture and use;


• | issued patents and pending patent applications in Europe, the United States, and other countries throughout the world, including Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, and South Korea, that claim sotagliflozin and associated crystalline forms, pharmaceutical compositions comprising sotagliflozin, and methods of its manufacture and use;


• | pending patent applications in Europe, the United States, and other countries throughout the world, including Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, and South Korea, that disclose and/or claim LX9211, pharmaceutical compositions comprising LX9211, and methods of its use; and


• | pending patent applications in Europe, the United States, and other countries throughout the world, including Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, and South Korea, that disclose and/or claim LX2761, pharmaceutical compositions comprising LX2761, and methods of its use.

Additionally, we hold rights to a number of patents and patent applications under license agreements with third parties.  Many of these licenses are nonexclusive, although some are exclusive in specified fields.  Most of the licenses have terms that extend for the life of the licensed patents.

Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.  We have filed patent applications and hold issued patents covering our approved drug, XERMELO, and each of our drug candidates.  None of our United States patents that claim XERMELO or one of our drug candidates has a normal expiration date earlier than 2026.
All of our employees, consultants and advisors are required to execute a proprietary information agreement upon the commencement of employment or consultation. In general, the agreement provides that all inventions conceived by the employee or consultant, and all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the term of the agreement, shall be our exclusive property and shall be kept confidential, with disclosure to third parties allowed only in 
 15

specified circumstances. We cannot assure you, however, that these agreements will provide useful protection of our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
Our patent and intellectual property rights are subject to certain rights and uncertainties. See “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
