ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Development of Business
Conagra Brands, Inc. (the "Company", "Conagra Brands", "we", "us", or "our"), headquartered in Chicago, is one of North America's leading branded food companies. Guided by an entrepreneurial spirit, the Company combines a rich heritage of making great food with a sharpened focus on innovation that enables the Company to evolve its portfolio to satisfy people's changing food preferences. Its iconic brands such as Birds Eye®, Marie Callender's®, Banquet®, Healthy Choice®, Slim Jim®, Reddi-wip®, and Vlasic®, as well as emerging brands, including Angie's® BOOMCHICKAPOP®, Duke's®, Earth Balance®, Gardein®, and Frontera®, offer choices for every occasion.
We began as a Midwestern flour-milling company and entered other commodity-based businesses throughout our history. We were initially incorporated as a Nebraska corporation in 1919 and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in January 1976. Over time, we transformed into the branded, pure-play consumer packaged goods food company we are today. We achieved this through various acquisitions, including consumer food brands such as Banquet®, Chef Boyardee®, Marie Callender’s®, Alexia®, Blake's®, Frontera®, Duke’s®, BIGS®, Birds Eye®, Vlasic®, and divestitures. We have divested our Lamb Weston business, Private Brands business, Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings business, JM Swank business, Wesson® oil business, Italian-based frozen pasta business, milling business, dehydrated and fresh vegetable operations, and a trading and merchandising business, among others. Growing our food businesses has also been fueled by innovation, organic growth of our brands, and expansion into adjacent categories. We are focused on delivering sustainable, profitable growth with strong and improving returns on our invested capital.
On October 26, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Pinnacle Foods Inc. ("Pinnacle"). As a result of the acquisition, Pinnacle became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
On November 9, 2016, we completed the spinoff of Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. ("Lamb Weston") through a distribution of 100% of our interest in Lamb Weston to holders, as of November 1, 2016, of outstanding shares of our common stock (the "Spinoff"). The transaction effecting this change was structured as a tax-free spinoff. 
In January 2013, we acquired Ralcorp Holdings, Inc. ("Ralcorp"), a manufacturer of private branded food. Since the acquisition of Ralcorp, we focused on addressing executional shortfalls and customer service issues intended to improve operating performance for our Private Brands business. However, after further review of the Private Brands business, we changed our strategic direction and divested the Private Brands business in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Narrative Description of Business
We compete throughout the food industry and focus on adding value for our customers who operate in the retail food and foodservice channels.
Our operations, including our reporting segments, are described below. Our locations, including manufacturing facilities, within each reporting segment, are described in Item 2, Properties.

The segment's primary food items included a variety of vegetable, spice, and frozen bakery goods, which were sold under brands such as Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings®. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we sold our Spicetec and JM Swank businesses.

Unconsolidated Equity Investments

Acquisitions
On October 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Pinnacle. As a result of the acquisition, Pinnacle became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 26, 2018 (the "Merger Agreement"), among Conagra Brands, Pinnacle, and Patriot Merger Sub Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Conagra Brands that ceased to exist at the effective time of the merger, each share of Pinnacle common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger was converted into the right to receive (i) $43.11 per share in cash and (ii) 0.6494 shares of common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of the Company ("Company Shares") (together, the "Merger Consideration"), with cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Company Shares. The total amount of consideration paid in connection with the acquisition was approximately $8.03 billion and consisted of: (1) cash of $5.17 billion ($5.12 billion, net of cash acquired); (2) 77.5 million Company Shares, with an approximate value of $2.82 billion, issued out of the Company's treasury to former holders of Pinnacle stock; and (3) replacement awards issued to former Pinnacle employees representing the fair value attributable to pre-combination service of $51.1 million. Approximately $7.02 billion of the purchase price has been allocated to goodwill, pending determination of the final purchase price allocation. Approximately $3.52 billion has been allocated to brands, trademarks and other intangibles. Of the total goodwill, $236.7 million is deductible for tax purposes. Amortizable brands, trademarks and other intangibles totaled $668.7 million. Indefinite lived brands, trademarks and other intangibles totaled $2.85 billion. This business is reflected in the Pinnacle Foods segment.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed the sale of our Wesson® oil business for net proceeds of $171.8 million, subject to final working capital adjustments. The business results were previously reported primarily in our Grocery & Snacks segment, and to a lesser extent within the Foodservice and International segments. The assets of this business have been reclassified as assets held for sale within our Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented prior to the divestiture.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed the sale of our Del Monte® processed fruit and vegetable business in Canada for combined proceeds of $32.2 million. The results of operations of the divested Del Monte® business are included in our International segment for the periods preceding the completion of the transaction. The assets of this business have been reclassified as assets held for sale within our Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented prior to the divestiture.
On November 9, 2016, we completed the Spinoff of our Lamb Weston business. As of such date, we did not beneficially own any equity interest in Lamb Weston and no longer consolidated Lamb Weston into our financial results. We reflected the results of this business as discontinued operations for all periods presented. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed the sales of our Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings business ("Spicetec") and our JM Swank business for combined proceeds of $489.0 million. The results of operations of Spicetec and JM Swank are included in the Commercial segment.
General
The following comments pertain to all of our reporting segments.
Conagra Brands is a branded consumer packaged goods food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry, with a significant focus on the sale of branded, private branded, and value-added consumer food, as well as foodservice items and ingredients. We use many different raw materials, the bulk of which are commodities. The prices paid for raw materials used in making our food generally reflect factors such as weather, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, tariffs, and the effects of governmental agricultural programs. Although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors, we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources. From time to time, we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials, packaging, and energy inputs. We seek to mitigate higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives, and the use of derivative instruments to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption.
We experience intense competition for sales of our food items in our major markets. Our food items compete with widely advertised, well-known, branded food, as well as private branded and customized food items. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, value, customer service, brand recognition, and brand loyalty.
Demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events.
3

We manufacture, primarily for stock and fill, our customer orders from finished goods inventories. While at any given time there may be some backlog of orders, such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales, and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant.
Our trademarks are of material importance to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the United States and most other markets where the related food items are sold. Some of our food items are sold under brands that have been licensed from others. We also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents, although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole. We have proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes, and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.
Many of our facilities and products we make are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the food safety and quality, sanitation, safety and health matters, and environmental control. We believe that we comply with such laws and regulations in all material respects and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings, or our competitive position.
Our largest customer, Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 24% of consolidated net sales for each of fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017.
As of May 26, 2019, Conagra Brands and its subsidiaries had approximately 18,000 employees, primarily in the United States. Approximately 51% of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements. Of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements, approximately 23% are parties to collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire during fiscal 2020. We believe our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good.
