ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
We were originally formed as a corporation in the State of Nevada on September 16, 1965 under the name “Canyon State Mining Corporation of Nevada.” After several name changes through the years, in 2005 we changed our name to DGSE Companies, Inc. Our principal executive offices are located at 13022 Preston Rd., Dallas, Texas 75240. Our telephone number is 972-587-4049. Our primary commercial internet addresses are www.DGSE.com and www.CGDEinc.com, and we also maintain www.DGSECompanies.com primarily as a corporate information and investor relations website. We hold registered trademarks for the company name “Dallas Gold & Silver Exchange” and the corresponding logo.
 
We buy and sell jewelry, diamonds, fine watches, rare coins and currency, precious metal bullion products, scrap gold, silver, platinum and palladium as well as collectibles and other valuables. Our customers include individual consumers, dealers and institutions throughout the United States. Our operations are organized around two primary types of customers, retail customers and wholesale customers.

Customer Types
 
Retail
 
As of the fiscal year end December 31, 2018 (“Fiscal 2018”), our products and services were marketed through five retail locations in South Carolina and Texas. In Fiscal 2017, we closed one location in the DFW area. Our retail locations operate under several banners, including Charleston Gold & Diamond Exchange, and Dallas Gold & Silver Exchange, and are supported by websites at www.CGDEinc.com and www.DGSE.com.
 
Our retail footprint has evolved significantly in recent years, growing and contracting largely in line with changes in the precious metals market. In 2011, as we acquired Southern Bullion, precious metal prices hit all-time highs, but by 2012 the markets had softened significantly. During the year ended December 31, 2013 (“Fiscal 2013”), the precious metals market experienced a significant downturn, as evidenced by a nearly 30% decrease in the price of an ounce of gold, as measured by London PM Fix, between January 1 and December 31, 2013. While prices were more stable in 2014, they remained well below levels reached in 2011. This downturn significantly changed the economics of our business, and led us to further evaluate the number and locations of retail stores, resulting in the closure of all Southern Bullion locations in the first half of Fiscal 2014. The volatility in the price per ounce of gold continued in 2015 Fiscal 2016, rebounding somewhat by August 2016 to $1,350 an ounce, jumping 26%, only to fall to $1,147 an ounce, by 2016 year end. The price of gold did rebound once again during 2017 to end at $1,303 an ounce, at year end. Gold continued to increase to $1,353 by April of 2018 and once again, receded to $1,175 in August. The price did rebound to $1,283 at December 31, 2018. The decrease produced a 1.5% net loss in gold prices from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. The volatility was still prevalent during the year, and the general overall trend was slightly downward during Fiscal 2018.
 
As noted above, in 2017 we made the decision to close one DFW location when the lease expired at our Sherry Lane store. Since Sherry Lane was located near our flagship store on Preston Road, it was decided to consolidate the smaller one into our flagship location. We do not expect, at this time, to open incremental retail locations in the next 12 months.
 
Wholesale
 
We transact a significant amount of business with wholesalers and other companies in our industry. This wholesale transactional activity occurs at industry-specific trade shows held periodically throughout the year, during in-person and telephonic sales calls, and on industry trade websites that facilitate wholesale trades for our industry.
Products and Services
 
Jewelry
 
We sell items in every major jewelry category, including bridal jewelry, fashion jewelry, custom-made jewelry, diamonds and other gemstones, watches and findings (jewelry components).
 
A substantial percentage of our jewelry inventory is purchased directly from our customers at our retail locations. These jewelry items and fine watches are then cleaned, serviced and repaired by our experienced jewelers so that they are in a like-new condition and suitable for resale.
 
The higher-quality diamonds and gemstones we purchase are certified by the Gemological Institute of America (“GIA”) and other third-party certifying authorities for an independent assessment of their quality. This process aides us in reselling these stones individually or as a component of our custom bridal and fashion jewelry. Mid-quality diamonds and gemstones are often utilized in custom fashion jewelry or packaged with lower-quality stones and sold to wholesalers across the country.

We maintain relationships with numerous commercial consignment vendors across the country who, supply us with new and estate jewelry. This supplements jewelry that we purchase over the counter and enhances our overall jewelry offering. Any sales made from this consignment jewelry stock are settled with our consignment vendors on a weekly or monthly basis.
 
We also maintain jewelry repair centers in three of our locations, and accept repair, polishing and service orders through all of our retail locations.
 
Jewelry retailing is highly fragmented and competitive. We compete for jewelry sales primarily against specialty jewelers such as Zales, Jared, and Kay’s, as well as other retailers that sell jewelry, including department stores, discount stores, apparel outlets, and internet retailers. The jewelry category competes for a share of our customers’ disposable income with other consumer sectors such as electronics, clothing and furniture, as well as travel and restaurants. This competition for consumers’ discretionary spending is particularly relevant to gift giving, and also has some relevance with respect to bridal jewelry (e.g. engagement, wedding, and anniversary).
 
Bullion
 
Our bullion trading operation buys and sells all forms of gold, silver, platinum and palladium precious metals products, including United States and other government coins, private mint medallions, art bars and trade unit bars. Retail bullion transactions are conducted with individual consumers at all of our store locations and online at www.USBullionExchange.com. Wholesale bullion transactions are conducted through our main-bullion trading operation in Dallas, Texas, which maintains numerous vendor relationships with major industry wholesalers, mints and institutions.
 
Bullion products are purchased and sold based on current market pricing for precious metals. The bullion inventory is subject to market value changes created by the underlying commodity markets. While we believe that we effectively manage the commodity risk associated with our bullion activity, there are several national and international factors which are out of our control that may affect margins, customer demand and transactional volume in our bullion business. These factors include but are not limited to, U.S. Federal Reserve policies, inflation rates, global economic uncertainty, governmental and private mint supply and other factors.
 
Through a series of transactions beginning in 2010, Elemetal, LLC (“Elemetal”), NTR Metals, LLC (“NTR”) and Truscott Capital, LLC (“Truscott”), collectively (the “Related Entities”), became the largest shareholders of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Common Stock”). NTR transferred all of its Common Stock to Eduro Holdings, LLC (“Eduro”) on August 28, 2018. A certain Related Entity had been our principal supplier of bullion products until April 3, 2018. We have secured a non-related party to be our principal supplier.
 
Rare Coins, Currency and Collectibles
 
We buy and sell most numismatic items, including rare coins, currency, medals, tokens and other collectibles. The majority of our rare coin, currency and collectibles are derived from individual customers selling their collections to us. We then resell them through our retail activities or on the wholesale market through our wholesale contacts.
Scrap
 
Individual and wholesale customers sell their jewelry and other precious-metal items to us at all of our retail locations. After we have purchased these valuables, they are processed at a centralized clearing house where expert jewelers, gemologists and watchmakers sort items into three main resale categories: Retail Appropriate, Wholesale Appropriate and Refiner Appropriate. Items deemed appropriate for resale at one of our retail locations are cleaned, serviced and repaired by our expert jewelers so they are in like-new condition. The vast majority of these items are then individually tagged and sent to one of our retail locations to sell. Items not appropriate for our retail locations are grouped into wholesale lots and liquidated through wholesale contacts, or in-person dealer-to-dealer transactions. Items that are not appropriate for either retail or wholesale purposes are sold to a refiner.

Relationships
 
Through a series of transactions beginning in 2010, the Related Entities became the largest shareholders of our Common Stock. Our transactions with the Related Entities are more fully described in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, Related-Party Transactions.
 
On December 9, 2016, DGSE and certain Related Entities closed the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement dated June 20, 2016 (the “Debt Exchange Agreement”) whereby DGSE issued certain Related Entities 14,485,145 shares of Common Stock for $0.41 per share in exchange for the cancellation and forgiveness of indebtedness and trade payables of $5,938,909. Also on the same date and pursuant to the Debt Exchange Agreement, DGSE issued a warrant to purchase an additional 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.65 per share, exercisable within two years after December 9, 2016 as part of the consideration for the cancellation and forgiveness of trade payables. The warrant expired in December, 2018 without being exercised.
 
Truscott and NTR each filed reports on Schedule 13D disclosing their respective beneficial ownership of Common Stock. As of April 12, 2018, the Related Entities collectively beneficially own 71.4 % of our Common Stock, with Truscott beneficially owning 47.7% and NTR beneficially owning 23.7%. NTR transferred all of its Common Stock to Eduro on August 29, 2018. John Loftus controls each of NTR and Eduro.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
In Fiscal 2018, our advertising activities continued to rely on radio, print, and digital media. Marketing activities centered on each of the major business categories, emphasizing our broad array of products, expertise, and price advantages compared to our local and regional competition. In Fiscal 2018, we spent approximately $416,306 on advertising and marketing in our operations, a 52% year-over-year decrease. Our advertising and marketing spending represents costs for traditional and digital media, in-store displays, brochures and informational pamphlets, production fees, and other related items.
 
In 2019, we anticipate our radio, digital and social media presence to remain an integral part of our marketing strategy. Our website has been redesigned to be viewed on a variety of platforms across a multitude of digital devices. We believe our enhanced web platform also facilitates a personalized shopping experience, including recommending inventory, and delivers a seamless digital experience for product research and social sharing. Additionally, we anticipate that social-media will play an increasingly larger role in our overall advertising mix. We anticipate that digital advertising will allow us to target specific customer groups on a wider scale.
 
Seasonality
 
The retail and wholesale jewelry business is generally seasonal. Christmas, Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day are the main seasons for jewelry sales. Summer is the slow season.
 
While our bullion, scrap and rare-coin businesses are not as seasonal, we believe they are directly impacted by several national and international factors outside of our control. These factors may affect margins, customer demand and transactional volume in our bullion and rare-coin business. These factors include but are not limited to, U.S. Federal Reserve policies, inflation rates, global economic uncertainty, governmental and private mint supply and other factors.
 
Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive industry where competition is based on a combination of price, service and product quality. Our jewelry and scrap activities compete with numerous other competitors in the markets in which we operate. These competitors include big-box retailers, national jewelry chains, individual jewelry stores, web-only entities, pawn shops and other businesses that attempt to enter this industry as an add-on to their existing business lines.

The bullion and rare-coin industry in which we compete is dominated by substantially larger enterprises, which retail and wholesale bullion, rare coins and other precious-metal products through traditional store-front locations and via the internet.
 
We compete in these industries by taking advantage of core competencies in the following areas:
 

● | Pricing – We believe we offer competitive or industry-leading price points across all of our product lines. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Selection – We offer a wide variety of inventory in each of our product lines. Our diverse selection allows us to market to the widest variety of potential clients while delivering items that competitors may have to back-order. 
● | Brick and Mortar Locations – We seek retail locations that simultaneously meet our client’s geographical needs while also providing a safe and attractive location to conduct business. 
● | Web Portals – In the future, our websites will allow clients who are located both inside and outside of our brick-and-mortar footprint to conduct business with us in an efficient and cost-effective manner. 
● | Staff – We employ a staff of experts with many years of experience in their respective fields, including jewelry, diamonds, premium and vintage watches, bullion and numismatic coins. We believe that when coupled with our corporate training programs, management structure and incentives for continuing education, our client-facing sales associates are among the nation’s best. 
● | Brand – We have spent millions of dollars over several decades advertising our brands, and have spent countless hours reinforcing our marketing message with our clients on an individual basis. As a result, our current and prospective clients place a significant amount of trust in our brands. Additionally, consumers have additional confidence in our brands due to our public-company status. 
● | Market Maker –While many of our competitors limit their participation to either buying or selling in certain markets, we both buy and sell at a retail level across all of our product lines and in all markets, creating a unique service for our retail customers. Our model makes it easy for customers to upgrade to a higher quality watch, diamond or jewelry item, easily moving a precious-metal investment into a different metal, or receive cash for an unwanted item. 

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 52 individuals, 50 of whom were full time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our current relations with employees are good. Our management follows a policy of keeping employees informed of decisions, and encourages and implements employee suggestions whenever practicable.
