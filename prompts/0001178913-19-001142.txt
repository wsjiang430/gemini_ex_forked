ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
Company Overview
 
Until January 10, 2019, we were engaged in the development of agents for the prevention and treatment of severe and potentially life-threatening infectious diseases. On January 10, 2019, we received a notice regarding the immediate termination of a certain license agreement, dated May 31, 2016 (the “License Agreement”), executed by and between the Company, Hadasit Medical Research Services and Development Ltd. (“Hadasit”) and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology R and D Corporation Limited (“RDC”). We relied primarily on the License Agreement with respect to the development of Artemisone, our lead product candidate. Since the termination of the License Agreement, the Company no longer has any operating business.
 
Former Business
 
Until the termination of the License Agreement we were engaged in the development of agents for the prevention and treatment of severe and potentially life-threatening infectious diseases. Our former lead product candidate, Artemisone, was a clinical-stage synthetic artemisinin derivative with antiviral and antiparasitic properties.
 
On May 31, 2016, we entered into the License Agreement with Hadasit and RDC, pursuant to which we acquired a worldwide, royalty-bearing license to make any and all use of certain patents and know-how owned by the Hadasit and RDC relating to Artemisone. The License Agreement was terminated as a result of the non-payment for certain sponsored research fees, patent expenses, patent maintenance fees, and consulting fees.
  
We have sustained significant losses in recent periods, which have resulted in a significant reduction in our cash reserves. As a result of the termination of the License Agreement, the Company no longer has any operating business. The Company believes that it will continue to experience losses and increased negative working capital and negative cash flows in the near future and will not be able to return to positive cash flow without obtaining additional financing in the near term or the completing of a business transaction. The Company has and will experience difficulties accessing the equity and debt markets and raising such capital, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise such additional capital on favorable terms or at all find a suitable business transaction. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities or a business transaction is concluded, the Company’s existing stockholders will experience significant further dilution. In order to conserve the Company’s cash and manage its liquidity, the Company has implemented cost-cutting initiatives including the reduction of employee headcount and overhead costs.

Present Business
 
Since the termination of the License Agreement, our Board of Directors has been exploring strategic alternatives.
 
Shell Company Status
 
Based on the lack of Company business activities since the termination of the License Agreement, our Company is classified as a “shell” company by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Rule 144(i)(1)(i) Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) defines a shell company as a company that has:
 
 (A) No or nominal operations; and
 (B) Either:

 (1) No or nominal assets;
 (2) Assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or
 (3) Assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets.

 
Searching for Business Combination Candidate
 

The Company is undercapitalized. The Company is seeking a business combination candidate that would bring revenue and/or asset value to the Company. A business combination candidate would most probably be a private company that seeks to become a publicly traded company through a business combination transaction with a publicly held and quoted company. Often times these business combination transactions are termed “reverse mergers” or “reverse acquisitions” whereby the private company acquires a controlling interest in the publicly held company.
Other Relevant Factors
 
In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, the Company will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to the Company’s limited capital available for investigation, the Company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired.
 
No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to enter into a business combination, as to the terms of a business combination, or as to the nature of the target company.
 
Employees
 

As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no full-time employees and one part-time consultant.


Corporate Overview
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 22, 1997. On July 8, 2003, we effected a reincorporation from Nevada to Delaware through a merger with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary, InkSure Technologies (Delaware) Inc., which was incorporated on June 30, 2003. The surviving corporation in the merger was InkSure Technologies (Delaware) Inc., which thereupon renamed itself InkSure Technologies Inc. In 2014, we changed our name to New York Global Innovations Inc.  Upon the closing of the Merger, defined below, Artemis Subsidiary, defined below, became our wholly-owned subsidiary. The Merger closed on August 23, 2016, and such date is referred to as the “Effective Time.”

On August 23, 2016, we consummated a merger with Artemis Therapeutics Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Artemis Subsidiary”) and Artemis Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger Subsidiary”), pursuant to which Artemis Subsidiary merged with and into the Merger Subsidiary, with Artemis Subsidiary being the surviving entity (the “Merger”).  Following the Merger, we adopted the business plan of Artemis Subsidiary. Artemis Subsidiary was incorporated on April 19, 2016, under the laws of the State of Delaware. Between April 19, 2016, and August 23, 2016, Artemis’s business activities primarily consisted of negotiating and executing the License Agreement.
 
Pursuant to the Merger, the Merger Subsidiary merged with and into Artemis Subsidiary in a reverse merger, with Artemis Subsidiary surviving as our wholly-owned subsidiary. As consideration for the Merger, we issued an aggregate of 460,000 shares of common stock and 2,357.04 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock to the Artemis Subsidiary shareholders, such that each outstanding share of Artemis Subsidiary common stock was exchanged for the right to receive 50 shares of our common stock and 0.2562 shares of the Series B Preferred Stock (each share is convertible into 72,682.814 shares of the Company’s common stock) (collectively, the “Merger Shares”). In addition, we agreed to reserve for future issuance 40,000 shares of common stock and 204.96 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to Artemis Subsidiary option holders, including options issued to Dr. Wolf and Hadasit, as set forth in greater detail herein.
 
As a condition for the consummation of the Merger, the Company and Artemis Subsidiary agreed to the following covenants and closing conditions: (i) a requirement that a concurrent financing of not less than $590,000 shall have occurred immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) a requirement that the Company have a cash balance of at least $590,000, exclusive of the concurrent financing at the Effective Time; (iii) a requirement that Artemis Subsidiary, Hadasit and RDC have entered into and finalized a license agreement with respect to human cytomegalovirus technology; (iv) the resignation of Roberto Alonso Jimenez Arias, our former director, as a director of the Company at the Effective Time; (v) the appointment by Artemis Subsidiary of a new director; (vi) the right for Gadi Peleg, or his designee, to continue serving as a director of the Company for a period of one year from the closing of the Merger; and (vii) for a period of one year from the closing of the Merger, in the event that the Company desires to enter into a transaction involving the sale of securities at a pre-transaction valuation of $10,000,000 or less, the approval of Mr. Peleg, or his designee, shall be required prior to the Company entering into such transaction. The Company and Artemis Subsidiary agreed to waive the requirement that concurrent financing of not less than $590,000 shall have occurred immediately prior to the Effective Time and that the Company have a cash balance of at least $590,000, exclusive of the concurrent financing at the Effective Time.
 
In addition, on August 23, 2016, the Company closed on a private placement pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Acumen SPA”) with Acumen Bioventures LLC (“Acumen”) with respect to the sale of an aggregate of $500,000 of 68,321 shares of the Company’s common stock and 453 shares of Series A Preferred Stock (each share is convertible into 1,453.656 shares of the Company’s common stock). The Acumen SPA provided that the Company will obtain shareholder approval within 90 days of the date thereof to increase its authorized capital or conduct a reverse stock split such that the Company will have reserved for issuance at least 200% of the number of shares issuable upon conversion of all of the Series A Preferred Stock or be subject to liquidated damages (the “Approval”). The Board of Directors and the stockholders holding a majority of the Company’s voting power approved a 1-for-50 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) on November 2, 2016, and November 9, 2016, respectively. The Company’s management and its largest shareholder provided the Company with their irrevocable consent to the Approval.  The Acumen SPA also provides the investor with a 24-month right to (i) participate in future financings, (ii) purchase up to 100% of its investment at 120% of the per share purchase price, (iii) be issued additional securities in connection with any subsequent dilutive issuance by the Company; and (iv) piggyback or demand registration rights.
 
In conjunction with the closing of the Merger, on August 23, 2016, Roberto Alonso Jimenez Arias resigned as a director of the Company. At the effective time of the Merger, the Company’s board of directors and officers were reconstituted by the appointment of Dana Wolf as our Chief Scientific Officer and Israel Alfassi as a director.
 
For financial accounting purposes, the Merger between the Company and Artemis Subsidiary was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization and, as a result of the Merger, the Company ceased to be a shell company. As the shareholders of Artemis Subsidiary received the largest ownership interest in the Company, Artemis Subsidiary was determined to be the “accounting acquirer” in the reverse recapitalization. As a result, the historical financial statements of the Company were replaced with the historical financial statements of Artemis Subsidiary. Following the Merger, the Company and its subsidiary, Artemis Subsidiary, are collectively referred to as the “Company”.

On November 2, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved (i) an amendment (the “Amendment”) to its Certificate of Incorporation to decrease the Company’s authorized Common Stock from 75,000,000 shares, with a par value of $0.01 per share, to 51,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.01 per share, as well as reduce the Company’s authorized Preferred Stock from 10,000,000 shares, with a par value of $0.01 per share, to 200,000 shares with a par value of $0.01 per share, and (ii) a 1-for-50 reverse stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, such that each 50 shares of Common Stock held by stockholders of record on or about December 13, 2016 be combined into one share of Common Stock, except to the extent that the actions described herein result in any of the Company’s stockholders holding a fractional share of Common Stock (in which instance, because such stockholder’s number of shares is not evenly divisible by the 50:1 ratio, such stockholder will be automatically entitled to receive an additional fraction of a share of Common Stock to round up to the next whole share).  On November 9, 2016, stockholders holding a majority of the Company’s voting power approved the Amendment and the Reverse Stock Split by written consent in lieu of a meeting, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law. The Amendment and Reverse Stock Split took effect on December 20, 2016.
 
On October 23, 2017, the Company executed Securities Purchase Agreements (each, a “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with a total of 6 accredited investors relating to a private placement offering (the “Offering”) of an aggregate of 300,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a purchase price of $1.00 per share, and of 250 shares of the Company’s newly designated Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series C Preferred Stock”), at a purchase price of $1,000.00 per share, with such shares of Series C Preferred Stock initially convertible into an aggregate of 250,000 shares of Common Stock. In addition, each investor received a warrant (each, a “Warrant”) to purchase fifty percent of the number of shares of Common Stock effectively purchased in the Offering, for an aggregate of 275,000 shares of Common Stock. The closing of the Offering took place on October 23, 2017.
 
The Securities Purchase Agreement provides each investor with (i) a 12 month right to participate in future financings, (ii) a 24 month right to be issued additional securities in connection with any subsequent dilutive issuance by the Company, and (iii) 24 month piggyback and demand registration rights.  Each Warrant is immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $2.00 per share, expires 5 years from the date of issuance, may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, and contains future price-based and customary stock-based anti-dilution protections.
 
Pursuant to the Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of the Series C Preferred Stock (the “Certificate of Designation”), the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are convertible into an aggregate of 250,000 shares of Common Stock based on a conversion price of $1.00 per share. Such conversion price is subject to future price-based and customary stock-based anti-dilution protections. The holders of the Series C Preferred Stock do not possess any voting rights but the Series C Preferred Stock does carry a liquidation preference for each holder equal to the investment made by such holder in the Offering. In addition, the holders of Series C Preferred Stock are eligible to participate in dividends and other distributions by the Company on an as-converted basis.
 
As discussed above, on January 10, 2019, we received a notice regarding the immediate termination of the License Agreement. Since the termination of the License Agreement, the Company no longer has any operating business.
