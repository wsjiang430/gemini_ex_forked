Item 1. Business. 
In this Annual Report, unless specifically stated otherwise or the context indicates otherwise, the terms "Colony Capital," the "Company," "we," "our" and "us" refer to Colony Capital, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries beginning January 11, 2017, following the closing of the Merger, and Colony and its consolidated subsidiaries for all periods on or prior to the closing of the Merger on January 10, 2017. References to the “Operating Partnership,” our “Operating Company” and the “OP” refer to Colony Capital Operating Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the operating company of the Company, and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview 
We are a leading global investment management firm with approximately $43 billion in assets under management ("AUM"). We manage capital on behalf of our stockholders, as well as institutional and retail investors in private funds, traded and non-traded real estate investment trusts ("REITs") and registered investment companies. We have significant holdings in: (a) the healthcare, industrial and hospitality property sectors; (b) Colony Credit Real Estate, Inc. (NYSE: CLNC) and NorthStar Realty Europe, Corp (NYSE: NRE) which are both externally managed by subsidiaries of the Company; and (c) various other equity and debt investments. We are headquartered in Los Angeles, with key offices in New York, Paris and London, and have over 400 employees in 17 locations in ten countries.
We were organized on May 31, 2016 as a Maryland corporation, and elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our initial taxable year ended December 31, 2017. We conduct our operations as a REIT, and generally are not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our taxable income to stockholders and maintain qualification as a REIT, although we are subject to U.S. federal income tax on income earned through our taxable subsidiaries. We also operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act. We conduct substantially all of our activities and hold substantially all of our assets and liabilities through our Operating Company. At December 31, 2018, we owned 93.9% of the Operating Company, as its sole managing member.
Our Business
Our vision is to establish the Company as a leading global investment management firm, principally focused on real estate strategies. We believe our deep understanding of commercial real estate provides us a significant advantage in identifying relative value throughout real estate cycles. Through our prudent sector or subsector capital allocation and operational capabilities, we aim to generate outsized total returns on our balance sheet and third-party capital. Specifically, our preference is to invest our balance sheet capital alongside third party capital to create alignment and generate returns for our shareholders in two ways. First, through the return on investment through our balance sheet capital. Second, through base management fees paid by third party capital and potential carried interest, which provides us with a greater participation of profits after a minimum return is achieved. Over time, our goal is to manage third party capital alongside the majority of our balance sheet capital at a higher ratio than what is currently in place. 
Currently, we conduct our business through the following six segments: 

• | Healthcare—Our healthcare segment is composed of a diverse portfolio of senior housing, skilled nursing facilities, medical office buildings and hospitals. We earn rental income from our senior housing, skilled nursing facilities and hospital assets that are under net leases to single tenants/operators and from medical office buildings which are both single tenant and multi-tenant. In addition, certain of our senior housing properties are managed by operators under a RIDEA (REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act) structure, which effectively allows us to gain financial exposure to the underlying operations of the facility in a tax efficient manner versus receiving contractual rent under a net lease arrangement.


• | Industrial—Our industrial segment is composed of and primarily invests in light industrial assets throughout the U.S. that serve as the “last mile” of the logistics chain, which are vital for e-commerce and tenants that require increasingly quick delivery times. These properties are generally multi-tenant warehouses that are less than 250,000 square feet.


• | Hospitality—Our hospitality portfolio is composed of primarily extended stay and select service hotels located mainly in major metropolitan and high-demand suburban markets in the U.S., with the majority affiliated with top hotel brands such as Marriott and Hilton.

• | CLNC—This represents our investment in Colony Credit (as described below), a commercial real estate credit REIT with a diverse portfolio consisting primarily of commercial real estate ("CRE") senior mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, debt securities and net lease properties primarily in the U.S.


• | Other Equity and Debt—Our other equity and debt segment consists of a diversified group of strategic and non-strategic real estate and real estate-related debt and equity investments. Strategic investments include investments for which the Company acts as a general partner and/or manager (“GP Co-Investments”) and receives various forms of investment management economics on related third-party capital. Non-strategic investments are composed of those investments the Company does not intend to own for the long term including other real estate equity, real estate debt, and net leased assets, among other holdings.


• | Investment Management—Our investment management business raises, invests and manages funds on behalf of a diverse set of institutional and individual investors, for which we earn management fees, generally based on the amount of assets or capital managed, and contractual incentive fees or carried interest based on the performance of the investment vehicles managed subject to the achievement of minimum return hurdles. 

Refer to Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our reportable segments.
Merger 
On January 10, 2017, the Merger among NSAM, Colony and NRF to form Colony Capital, Inc. was completed in an all-stock exchange. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition, with NSAM as the legal acquirer for certain legal and regulatory matters, and Colony as the accounting acquirer for purposes of financial reporting.
Refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the Merger. 
Colony Credit
On August 25, 2017, certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into a combination agreement with NorthStar Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (“NorthStar I”) and NorthStar Real Estate Income II, Inc. (“NorthStar II”), both publicly registered non-traded real estate investment trusts sponsored and managed by a subsidiary of the Company, and certain other subsidiaries of the foregoing. Pursuant to the combination agreement, certain subsidiaries of the Company agreed to contribute the CLNY Contributed Portfolio (as defined below), represented by their ownership interests ranging from 38% to 100% in certain investment entities ("CLNY Investment Entities") to Colony Credit Real Estate, Inc. (formerly Colony NorthStar Credit Real Estate, Inc.) ("Colony Credit") and its operating company, and NorthStar I and NorthStar II agreed to merge with and into Colony Credit, with, in each case, Colony Credit surviving, in all-stock mergers (collectively, the “Combination”).
The CLNY Contributed Portfolio comprised the Company's interests in certain of its commercial real estate loans, net lease properties and limited partnership interests in third-party sponsored funds within the Company’s other equity and debt segment that were based in the U.S. and consistent with Colony Credit's strategy at the time of the Combination. 
On January 18, 2018, the Combination was approved by the stockholders of NorthStar I and NorthStar II. The Combination closed on January 31, 2018. Upon closing of the Combination, the Company and its affiliates, NorthStar I stockholders and NorthStar II stockholders each owned approximately 37%, 32% and 31%, respectively, of Colony Credit on a fully diluted basis.
On June 25, 2018, Colony Credit changed its name from "Colony NorthStar Credit Real Estate, Inc." to "Colony Credit Real Estate, Inc." Additionally, in June 2018, Colony Credit was added to the Small-cap Russell 2000 and broad-market Russell 3000 Indexes. 
Refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to the Combination. 
Corporate Restructuring
Following a strategic review process, in November 2018, we announced a corporate restructuring and reorganization plan aimed at reducing our annual compensation and administrative expenses over the next 12 months. The restructuring plan was designed to match resources that further align our increasing focus on our investment management business by, among other things, reducing our workforce globally by 10% to 20%, primarily in connection with the exit of non-core assets and business lines, together with general cost reductions. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we incurred $19.3 million of restructuring costs, which were primarily compensation costs.

Investment Strategy
We believe we can achieve our business objective of delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns through our rigorous underwriting and asset management processes, which benefit from our deep real estate experience, having invested through multiple economic cycles. These processes allow us to implement a flexible yet disciplined investment strategy for our balance sheet and for the companies and funds we manage on behalf of third parties as more fully described below:

• | capitalizing on asset-level underwriting experience and market analytics to identify investments with pricing dislocations and attractive risk-return profiles that can be purchased at meaningful discounts to our estimates of intrinsic value;


• | seeking to acquire assets that are undervalued as a result of operating uncertainty or liquidity constraints;


• | enhancing cash flow and asset values during ownership by active asset management and implementing opportunistic resolution and exit strategies;


• | originating and structuring senior and/or junior loans with attractive return profiles relative to the underlying value and financial operating performance of the real estate collateral and the strength and quality of the sponsorship;


• | structuring transactions with the appropriate amount of leverage, if any, based on the risk, duration and structure of the underlying asset’s cash flow.

Our investment strategy is dynamic and flexible, which enables us to adapt to shifts in economic, real estate and capital market conditions and to exploit inefficiencies around the world. Consistent with this strategy, in order to capitalize on the investment opportunities that may be present in various points of an economic cycle, we may expand or change our investment strategy or target assets over time as appropriate. We believe that the diversification of the portfolio of assets that we have acquired, our ability to acquire, originate and manage our target assets and the flexibility of our strategy will position us to identify undervalued opportunities and to generate attractive long-term returns for our stockholders in a variety of market conditions.
Financing Strategy
Our financing strategy in general is to favor investment-specific financing principally on a non-recourse basis, and then corporate financing, which is generally recourse to the Company or the Company’s assets. We seek to match terms and currencies, as available and applicable, and the amount of leverage we use is based on our assessment of a variety of factors, including, among others, the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of the assets in our investment portfolio, the potential for losses and extension risk in our portfolio, the ability to raise additional equity to reduce leverage and create liquidity for future investments, the availability of credit at favorable prices or at all, the credit quality of our assets, our outlook for borrowing costs relative to the income earned on our assets and financial covenants within our credit facilities. 
Our decision to use leverage to finance our assets is at our discretion and not subject to the approval of our stockholders. To the extent that we use leverage in the future, we may mitigate interest rate risk through utilization of hedging instruments, primarily interest rate swap and cap agreements, to serve as a hedge against future interest rate increases on our borrowings. Refer to "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for discussion of our liquidity needs and sources of liquidity.
Risk Management
Risk management is a significant component of our strategy to deliver consistent risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act, we closely monitor our portfolio and actively manage risks associated with, among other things, our assets and interest rates. In addition, the risk committee of our board of directors, in consultation with our chief risk officer, internal auditor and other management, periodically reviews our policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including key risks to which we are subject, including credit risk, liquidity risk, financing risk, foreign currency risk and market risk, and the steps that management has taken to monitor and control such risks. The audit committee of our board of directors maintains oversight of financial reporting risk matters.
Underwriting
In connection with evaluating any potential equity or debt investment for our portfolio or a managed investment vehicle, our underwriting team, in conjunction with third party providers, undertakes an asset-level due diligence process, involving data collection and analysis, to ensure that we understand the state of the market and the risk-reward profile of the asset. In addition, we evaluate material accounting, legal, financial and business issues surrounding such investment. These issues and risks are built into the valuation of an asset and ultimate pricing of an investment.
9

During the underwriting process, we review the following data, including, but not limited to: property financial data including historic and budgeted financial statements, liquidity and capital expenditure plans, property operating metrics (including occupancy, leasing activity, lease expirations, sales information, tenant credit review, tenant delinquency reports, operating expense efficiency and property management efficacy) and local and real estate market conditions including vacancy rates, absorption, new supply, rent levels and comparable sale transactions, as applicable. For debt investments, we also analyze metrics such as loan-to-collateral value ratios, debt service coverage ratios, debt yields, sponsor credit ratings and performance history.
In addition to evaluating the merits of any particular proposed investment, we evaluate the diversification of our or a particular managed investment vehicle’s portfolio of assets, as the case may be. Prior to making a final investment decision, we determine whether a target asset will cause the portfolio of assets to be too heavily concentrated with, or cause too much risk exposure to, any one real estate sector, geographic region, source of cash flow such as tenants or borrowers, or other geopolitical issues. If we determine that a proposed investment presents excessive concentration risk, we may decide not to pursue an otherwise attractive investment.
Investment Committees
We have established investment committees composed of senior executives for our various business segments as well as for the portfolios of the funds we manage. These investment committees review and evaluate potential investment opportunities, and meet periodically with the Company’s portfolio management team to review and monitor risks posed by existing investments.
Allocation Procedures
We currently manage, and may in the future manage, REITs and other entities that have investment and/or rate of return objectives similar to our own or to other investment vehicles that we manage. In order to address the risk of potential conflicts of interest among us and our managed investment vehicles, we have implemented an investment allocation policy consistent with our duty as a registered investment adviser to treat our managed investment vehicles fairly and equitably over time. See “—Regulation under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940” below. Pursuant to this policy, investment allocation decisions are based on a suitability assessment involving a review of numerous factors, including the particular source of capital’s investment objectives, available cash, diversification/concentration, leverage policy, the size of the investment, tax, anticipated pipeline of suitable investments and fund life.
Portfolio Management
The comprehensive portfolio management process generally includes day-to-day oversight by the Company's portfolio management team, regular management meetings and quarterly asset review process. These processes are designed to enable management to evaluate and proactively identify asset-specific issues and trends on a portfolio-wide basis for both assets on our balance sheet and assets of the companies within our investment management business. Nevertheless, we cannot be certain that such review will identify all issues within our portfolio due to, among other things, adverse economic conditions or events adversely affecting specific assets; therefore, potential future losses may also stem from investments that are not identified during these credit reviews. 
We use many methods to actively manage our risk to preserve our income and capital. For commercial real estate equity and debt investments, frequent re-underwriting and dialogue with tenants, operators, partners and/or borrowers and regular inspections of our collateral and owned properties have proven to be an effective process for identifying issues early. With respect to our healthcare properties, we consider the impact of regulatory changes on operator performance and property values. During a quarterly review, or more frequently as necessary, investments are monitored and identified for possible asset impairment and loan loss reserves, as appropriate, based upon several factors, including missed or late contractual payments, significant declines in collateral performance and other data which may indicate a potential issue in our ability to recover our invested capital from an investment. In addition, we seek to utilize services of certain strategic partnerships and joint ventures with third parties with expertise in commercial real estate or other sectors and markets to assist our portfolio management. 
In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act, and maximize returns and manage portfolio risk, we may dispose of an asset earlier than anticipated or hold an asset longer than anticipated if we determine it to be appropriate depending upon prevailing market conditions or factors regarding a particular asset. We can provide no assurances, however, that we will be successful in identifying or managing all of the risks associated with acquiring, holding or disposing of a particular asset or that we will not realize losses on certain assets.
10

Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Hedging 
Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act, we may mitigate the risk of interest rate volatility through the use of hedging instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements. The goal of our interest rate management strategy is to minimize or eliminate the effects of interest rate changes on the value of our assets, to improve risk-adjusted returns and, where possible, to lock in, on a long-term basis, a favorable spread between the yield on our assets and the cost of financing such assets. In addition, because we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we employ foreign currency risk management strategies, including the use of, among others, currency hedges, and matched currency financing. We can provide no assurances, however, that our efforts to manage interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility will successfully mitigate the risks of such volatility on our portfolio.
Operating and Regulatory Structure
REIT Qualification
We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our initial taxable year ended December 31, 2017. So long as we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the REIT-level on our REIT taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income and the composition and values of our assets (which, based on the types of assets we own, can fluctuate rapidly, significantly and unpredictably), our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our shares. In addition, we hold certain of our assets through taxable REIT subsidiaries (each a "TRS"), which are subject to U.S. federal and applicable state and local income taxes (and any applicable non-U.S. taxes) at regular corporate rates. Due to the nature of the assets in which we invest, our TRSs may have a material amount of assets and net taxable income.
1940 Act Exemption
We intend to continue to conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act. Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the 1940 Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged in, or proposes to engage in, the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Excluded from the definition of investment securities under the 1940 Act, among other things, are U.S. Government securities and securities issued by majority owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, which relate to “private” investment companies.
We are organized as a holding company that conducts its businesses primarily through wholly owned or majority owned subsidiaries. We expect that many of our subsidiaries will qualify for an exception from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c)(5)(C) or Section 3(c)(6) of the 1940 Act. Section 3(c)(5)(C) provides an exception for entities “primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.” The SEC staff has taken the position that this exemption generally requires that at least 55% of an entity’s assets must be comprised of mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate, also known as “qualifying assets,” and at least another 25% of the entity’s assets must be comprised of additional qualifying assets or a broader category of assets that we refer to as “real estate-related assets” (and no more than 20% of the entity’s assets may be comprised of miscellaneous assets). Section 3(c)(6) provides an exception for entities that are primarily engaged, directly or through majority owned subsidiaries, in, among other things, the business of purchasing mortgages or other real estate interests. We intend to limit the investment securities we hold in our wholly owned or majority owned subsidiaries that rely solely on the exception from the definition of investment company contained in Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, with the result that, combined with any other investment securities we may hold directly, the value of such securities do not exceed 40% of the value of our total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We intend to monitor our holdings to ensure ongoing compliance with the 40% test. In addition, we believe we are not an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act because we do not and will not engage primarily, or hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, through our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries, we are primarily engaged in the non-investment company businesses of these subsidiaries. 
11

Continuing qualification for exemption from registration under the 1940 Act will limit our ability to make certain investments. For example, for our subsidiaries that rely on Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act, the requirements to maintain the exemption will limit their ability to invest directly in mortgage-backed securities that represent less than the entire ownership in a pool of mortgage loans, debt and equity tranches of securitizations and certain asset-backed securities and real estate companies or assets not related to real estate.
We classify our investments for purposes of testing for these exemptions based in large measure on no-action letters issued by the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and other SEC interpretive guidance. These positions were based upon facts that may be different from ours, and many of these no-action positions were issued more than twenty years ago. To the extent that the Staff of the Division of Investment Management of the SEC provides more specific guidance regarding any of the matters bearing upon any exemption on which we may rely, we may be required to adjust our holdings and strategies accordingly. Additional guidance from the Staff of the Division of Investment Management of the SEC could provide us with additional flexibility, or it could further inhibit our ability to pursue strategies we have chosen. For example, on August 31, 2011, the SEC issued a concept release (Release No. 29778, File No. S7-34-11, Companies Engaged in the Business of Acquiring Mortgages and Mortgage Related Instruments), pursuant to which it is reviewing whether certain companies that invest in mortgage-backed securities should continue to be allowed to rely on the exclusion from registration under Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act. If the SEC takes action with respect to this exclusion, these changes could result in certain of our securitization vehicles and other subsidiaries being no longer able to rely on the exclusion from registration under Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act. In such a case, we would either need to conform our activities to one or more other exemptions from the 1940 Act or lose our status as exempt from registration under the 1940 Act, either of which could result in an adverse effect on us.
If we or our subsidiaries fail to maintain an exception or exemption from the 1940 Act, we may be required to, among other things: (i) substantially change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act; or (ii) register as an investment company under the 1940 Act. Either of (i) or (ii) could have an adverse effect on us and the market price of our securities. If we were required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure (including our ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the 1940 Act), portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration, and other matters.
Regulation under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
We have subsidiaries that are registered with the SEC as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Advisers Act"). As a result, we are subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and to applicable fiduciary duties derived from these provisions that apply to our relationships with the investment vehicles that we manage. These provisions and duties impose restrictions and obligations on us with respect to our dealings with our investors and our investments, including, for example, restrictions on agency, cross and principal transactions. We, or our registered investment adviser subsidiaries, will be subject to periodic SEC examinations and other requirements under the Investment Advisers Act and related regulations primarily intended to benefit advisory clients. These additional requirements relate, among other things, to maintaining an effective and comprehensive compliance program, recordkeeping and reporting requirements and disclosure requirements. The Investment Advisers Act generally grants the SEC broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict an investment adviser from conducting advisory activities in the event it fails to comply with federal securities laws. Additional sanctions that may be imposed for failure to comply with applicable requirements include the prohibition of individuals from associating with an investment adviser, the revocation of registrations and other censures and fines.
U.S. Healthcare Regulation—Overview
Assisted living, memory care, independent living, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and other healthcare providers that operate healthcare properties in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, regulations and industry standards governing their operations. Failure to comply with any of these, and other, laws could result in loss of licensure; loss of certification or accreditation; denial of reimbursement; imposition of civil and/or criminal penalties and fines; suspension or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs; or closure of the facility. Although the properties within our portfolio may be subject to varying levels of governmental scrutiny, we expect that the healthcare industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud and abuse and privacy and security, among others. We also expect that efforts by third-party payors, such as the federal Medicare program, state Medicaid programs and private insurers, to impose greater and more stringent cost controls upon operators will intensify and continue. Changes in laws, regulations, reimbursement, and enforcement activity can all have a significant effect on the operations and financial condition of our tenants, operators and managers, which in turn may adversely impact us, as set forth below and under "Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report.
12

Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Enforcement
Healthcare providers are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that govern their operations and, in some cases, arrangements with referral sources. These laws include those that require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to third-party payors valid and accurate statements for each service, as well as kickback laws, self-referral laws and false claims acts. In particular, enforcement of the federal False Claims Act has resulted in increased enforcement activity for healthcare providers and can involve significant monetary damages and awards to private plaintiffs who successfully bring “whistleblower” lawsuits. Sanctions for violations of these laws, regulations, and other applicable guidance may include, but are not limited to, loss of licensure, loss of certification or accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of civil and/or criminal penalties and fines, suspension or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs or closure of the facility; any of which could have a material adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of our tenants, operators and managers, which in turn may adversely impact us.
Healthcare Reform
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or ACA, impacted the healthcare marketplace by decreasing the number of uninsured individuals in the United States through the establishment of health insurance exchanges to facilitate the purchase of health insurance, expanded Medicaid eligibility, subsidized insurance premiums and included requirements and incentives for businesses to provide healthcare benefits. The ACA remains subject to continuing legislative, administrative and judicial scrutiny. In 2017, Congress enacted legislation eliminating the tax penalty for individuals who do not purchase insurance after it unsuccessfully sought to replace substantial parts of the ACA with different mechanisms for facilitating insurance coverage in the commercial and Medicaid markets. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) discontinued payment of cost-sharing reduction subsidies to insurance providers. In 2018, the average annual premium for employer-based family coverage rose five percent and three percent for single coverage. Further, CMS has begun approving waivers permitting states to alter state Medicaid programs by, among other things, requiring individuals to meet certain requirements, like work requirements, in order to maintain eligibility for Medicaid (although some of these waivers have subsequently been challenged in court). These and other actions may impact the insurance markets and reduce the number of individuals purchasing insurance or qualifying for Medicaid and may negatively impact the operations and financial condition of our tenants, operators and managers, which in turn may adversely impact us. Congress may revisit ACA or Medicaid reform legislation in 2019. If the ACA is repealed or further substantially modified, or if implementation of certain aspects of the ACA are suspended, slowed, or subject to reduced funding, such actions could negatively impact the operations and financial condition of our tenants and operators, which in turn may adversely impact us.
On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court in Texas ruled the ACA unconstitutional in its entirety. This decision has been appealed, and will not take effect while that appeal is pending. Nonetheless, should this ruling be upheld upon appeal, it could dramatically change U.S. healthcare regulation in numerous ways and may potentially spur congressional action, making the ultimate consequences of the ruling difficult to predict. Should the ruling be upheld and implemented, the immediate effects would include reduced access to health coverage through: (1) reduced Medicaid eligibility, (2) the disestablishment of health insurance exchanges and accompanying subsidized premiums, and (3) no requirement for businesses to provide health insurance. Amendments, including certain waivers to healthcare fraud and abuse laws made by the ACA would also be void, which could change the enforcement posture of federal regulators. Current healthcare reimbursement standards, including those discussed below, are predicated on changes made by the ACA and implementation of this ruling would create significant uncertainty regarding the legality of such standards and what standards are in effect absent the ACA. The effects of this ruling could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of our tenants and operators, which in turn may adversely impact us.
Healthcare Reimbursement
Federal, state and private payor reimbursement methodologies applied to healthcare providers continue to evolve. Federal and state healthcare financing authorities are continuing to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that shift risk to healthcare providers and generally reduce payments for services, which may negatively impact healthcare property operations. Additionally, Congress and the current presidential administration could substantially change the health insurance industry and payment systems. The impact of any such changes, if implemented, may result in an adverse effect on our tenants, managers and operators, which in turn may adversely impact us.
Skilled nursing facilities and hospitals typically receive most of their revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, with the balance representing reimbursement payments from private payors, including private insurers and self-pay patients. Senior housing facilities (assisted living, independent living and memory care facilities) typically receive most of their revenues from private pay sources and a small portion of their revenue from the Medicaid program. 
13

Providers that contract with government and private payors may be subject to periodic pre- and post-payment reviews and other audits. A review or audit of a property operator’s claims could result in recoupments, denials or delay of payments in the future, each of which could have a significant negative financial impact on such property. Additionally, there can be no guarantee that a third-party payor will continue to reimburse for services at current levels or continue to be available to residents of our facilities. Rates generated at facilities will vary by payor mix, market conditions and resident acuity. Rates paid by self-pay residents are set by the facilities and are determined by local market conditions and operating costs. 

• | Medicare Reimbursement—Medicare is a significant payor source for our skilled nursing facilities and hospitals. Skilled nursing facilities are reimbursed under the Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System, while hospitals are reimbursed by Medicare under prospective payment systems that vary based upon the type of hospital, geographic location and service furnished. Under these payment systems, providers typically receive fixed fees for defined services, which create a risk that payments will not cover the costs of delivering care. In addition, CMS continues to focus on linking payment to performance relative to quality and other metrics and bundling payments for multiple items and services in a way that shifts more financial risk to providers. These changes, and a facility’s ability to conform to them, could reduce payments and patient volumes for some facilities, including our tenants and operators, which may in turn impact us. Furthermore, while CMS has previously tested some of these new payment principles through optional “models,” CMS could adopt rules making certain detrimental payment policies mandatory. The current presidential administration could propose additional changes to the amount and manner in which healthcare providers are paid, and these changes also could have a material adverse effect on payments and patient volumes for some facilities. Lastly, Congress is contemplating substantial reforms to the Medicare program as a whole that, if enacted, could negatively impact the operations and financial condition of our tenants and operators, which in turn may adversely impact us. 


◦ | Skilled Nursing Conditions for Participation - On October 4, 2016, CMS published a final rule to make major changes to improve the care and safety of residents in long-term care facilities that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The policies in this final rule were targeted at reducing unnecessary hospital readmissions and infections, improving the quality of care, and strengthening safety measures for residents in these facilities. The regulations were effective on November 28, 2016, but CMS has been implementing the regulations using a phased approach, with Phase 1 of the regulations implemented on November 28, 2016, Phase 2 of the regulations implemented on November 28, 2017 and Phase 3 of the regulations to be implemented on November 28, 2019. Failure of our tenants and operators to comply with the new regulations could have an adverse impact the operations and financial condition of our tenants and operators, which in turn may adversely impact us.


◦ | Skilled Nursing-In August 2018, CMS adopted a revised methodology used to compensate skilled nursing facilities for therapy services, which changes the core basis of reimbursement from duration of services provided to reimbursement based on anticipated patient needs; these changes will take effect on October 1, 2019. A tenant or operator of a skilled nursing facility’s ability to conform to these changes could positively or negatively impact the facility’s revenue, which in turn may adversely impact us. 


• | Medicaid Reimbursement—Medicaid is also a significant payor source for our skilled nursing facilities and hospitals. The federal and state governments share responsibility for financing Medicaid. Within certain federal guidelines, states have a fairly wide range of discretion to determine Medicaid eligibility and reimbursement methodology. CMS, in part as a result of the change in leadership in the executive branch, has embraced a more flexible approach to state amendments and waivers that allow states even more latitude to determine eligibility and reimbursement. Certain states are attempting to slow the rate of growth in Medicaid expenditures by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits; some states have elected not to expand their Medicaid eligibility criteria pursuant to the ACA. Some states are transitioning their Medicaid programs to managed care models, which rely on networks of contracted providers to provide services at reduced negotiated rates to a higher volume of patients than they might see absent the contract. Such changes may reduce the volume of Medicaid patients at facilities that do not participate in the managed care plan’s network. Facilities that do participate may not receive a sufficient increase in patient volume to offset their lowered reimbursement rates. States and the federal government are also examining ways to further align Medicaid reimbursement with quality metrics and other value-based payment models that might shift risk to or place additional compliance costs on facilities. Congress and the current presidential administration have sought to repeal and alter the ACA and substantially reform the Medicaid program. If successful, Congress may repeal the provisions of the ACA that encouraged states to expand Medicaid eligibility to more adults, including additional federal matching funds that enabled states to do so. Congress also might impose strict limits on the federal role in subsidizing the costs of state Medicaid programs. These actions, if enacted, could result in states reducing or eliminating eligibility for certain individuals

and/or offsetting the cost by further reducing payments to providers of services. Congress is also considering enacting substantial reforms to Medicaid to grant states more autonomy and discretion to design Medicaid programs. These changes, if enacted, could also reduce or eliminate eligibility for certain individuals and/or allow states to further reduce payments to providers of services. In some states, our tenants and operators could experience delayed or reduced payment for services furnished to Medicaid enrollees, which in turn may adversely impact us. As noted above, ongoing litigation regarding the ACA and Medicaid waivers may also affect Medicaid coverage and reimbursement.
Healthcare Licensure, CON, Certification and Accreditation
Hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, senior housing facilities and other healthcare providers that operate healthcare properties in our portfolio may be subject to extensive state licensing and certificate of need, or CON, laws and regulations, which may restrict the ability of our tenants and operators to add new properties, expand an existing facility’s size or services, or transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new tenant, operator or manager. The failure of our tenants and operators to obtain, maintain or comply with any required license, CON or other certification, accreditation or regulatory approval (which could be required as a condition of third-party payor reimbursement) could result in loss of licensure, loss of certification or accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of civil and/or criminal penalties and fines, suspension or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs, or closure of the facility; any of which could have an adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of our tenants, operators and managers, which in turn may adversely impact us.
Health Information Privacy and Security
Healthcare providers, including those in our portfolio, are subject to numerous state and federal laws that protect the privacy and security of patient health information. The federal government, in particular, has significantly increased its enforcement of these laws. The failure of our tenants, operators and managers to maintain compliance with privacy and security laws could result in the imposition of penalties and fines, which in turn may adversely impact us.

Competition
The Company is engaged in a competitive multifaceted business and competes for capital from investors and numerous types of target assets.
 We compete directly with other real estate investment managers and to lesser degree, investment managers focused on corporate private equity, credit and hedge fund strategies and venture capital. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources, longer track records, more established relationships and more attractive fund terms, including fees. Further, as institutional fund investors increasingly consolidate their relationships for multiple investment products with a few investment firms, competition for capital from such institutional fund investors may become more acute.
Our competition for investments includes a variety of institutional investors, including other REITs and/or investment managers, specialty finance companies, public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, hedge funds, mortgage bankers, commercial finance and insurance companies, governmental bodies and other financial institutions. In addition, there are several REITs with similar investment objectives, including a number that have been recently formed, and others may be organized in the future. These other REITs increase competition for the available supply of industrial, healthcare, hospitality, commercial debt and equity real estate and other real estate-related assets suitable for purchase or origination. Some competitors may have greater financial resources, access to lower costs of capital and access to funding sources that may not be available to the Company, such as funding from the U.S. Government, if we are not eligible to participate in programs established by the U.S. Government. In addition, some of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT compliance or maintenance of an exemption from the 1940 Act. Furthermore, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, or pay higher prices, than we can. Current market conditions may attract more competitors, which may increase the competition for our target assets.
The industrial, healthcare and hospitality industries are also highly competitive. Competition in the markets in which our properties operate from existing or newly renovated properties could adversely affect the operating performance of our properties, and thus our financial results. Competition may also require us to make capital improvements or incur additional costs that we otherwise might not choose to make, which may adversely affect the profitability of our properties.
We also face competition in the recruitment and retention of qualified and skilled personnel. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees and consultants.

An increase in competition across the various components of our business may limit our ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders, thereby adversely affecting the market price of our common stock.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we employed over 400 full-time employees worldwide. 
Seasonality
Operations of our hospitality portfolio are affected by seasonal patterns resulting from overall economic cycles, geographic locations, weather and customer mix at the hotels. Generally, we expect our hotel portfolio to have higher revenues, operating income and cash flows in the second and third quarters of each year and lower revenues, operating income and cash flows in the first and fourth quarters of each year.
