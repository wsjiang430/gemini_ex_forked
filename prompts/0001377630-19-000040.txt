Item 1. | Business

The Company 
NCM, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was organized on October 5, 2006 and began operations on February 13, 2007 upon completion of its IPO. NCM, Inc. is a holding company that manages its consolidated subsidiary, NCM LLC.  NCM, Inc. has no business operations or material assets other than its cash and ownership interest of approximately 48.8% of the common membership units in NCM LLC as of December 27, 2018.  NCM LLC’s other members, Cinemark and Regal, two of the three largest motion picture exhibition companies in the U.S., held the remaining 51.2% of NCM LLC’s common membership units as of December 27, 2018.  NCM, Inc.’s primary source of cash flow from operations is distributions from NCM LLC pursuant to the NCM LLC operating agreement. NCM, Inc. also receives management fees pursuant to a management services agreement with NCM LLC in exchange for providing specific management services to NCM LLC.
Our Business
We are America's Movie Network. As the #1 weekend network for Millennials (age 18-34) in the U.S., NCM is the connector between brands and movie audiences.
We currently derive revenue principally from the sale of advertising to national, regional and local businesses in Noovie, our cinema advertising and entertainment pre-show seen on movie screens across the U.S. We also sell advertising on our Lobby Entertainment Network (“LEN”), a series of strategically-placed screens located in movie theater lobbies, as well as other forms of advertising and promotions in theater lobbies. In addition, we sell online and mobile advertising across our Noovie digital products as well as through our Cinema Accelerator digital product to reach entertainment audiences beyond the theater.
NCM LLC has long-term ESAs with the founding members (over 18 years remaining as of December 27, 2018) and multi-year agreements with certain third-party theater circuits, referred to in this document as “network affiliates,” which expire at various dates between March 15, 2019 and July 22, 2031.  The ESAs and network affiliate agreements grant NCM LLC exclusive rights in their theaters to sell advertising, subject to limited exceptions.
We believe that the broad reach and digital delivery of our network provides an effective platform for national, regional and local advertisers to reach a large, young, engaged and affluent audience on a targeted and measurable basis.  
On-Screen Advertising
Noovie—Our on-screen Noovie pre-show was launched in September 2017, replacing our prior pre-show called FirstLook. Our pre-show provides an entertaining pre-movie experience for theater patrons while serving as an incremental revenue source for our theater circuit partners. Noovie gives movie audiences a reason to arrive early to discover what’s next in entertainment, and it consists of national, regional and local advertising, as well as long-form entertainment and advertising content provided to us under exclusive multi-year arrangements with leading media, entertainment, technology and other companies (“content partners”).
Noovie generally ranges in length from 20 to 30 minutes and ends at or about the advertised show time, when the movie trailers and feature film begin. The trailers that run before the feature film are not part of Noovie.  
Because Noovie is customized by theater circuit, theater location/market, film rating, film genre and film title, we produce and distribute many different versions of Noovie each month. This programming flexibility provides advertisers with the ability to target specific audience demographics and geographic locations and gives us the ability to ensure that the content and advertising are age-appropriate for the movie audience. It also enables us to incorporate the branding of a specific theater circuit if desired. We rotate Noovie’s long-form content segments between theaters approximately every two weeks to ensure that frequent moviegoers are entertained by fresh content.
We also have the capability to deliver three-dimensional (“3-D”) advertising campaigns within a 3-D version of the Noovie pre-show program prior to 3-D feature films.
All versions of Noovie are produced by our internal creative team, which is cost-effective and gives us significant flexibility. We also offer pre- and post-production advertising creative services to our clients (primarily local clients who may not have their own creative agency) for a fee. 
Show Structure—Noovie is comprised of up to four segments, each approximately four to ten minutes in length.

• | Segment four is the first section of Noovie and begins approximately 25 to 30 minutes prior to the advertised show time. Entertaining content is a core element of Noovie, and NCM programs an exclusive

5

Noovie content pod at the beginning of the show that gives audiences a look at “what’s Noovie” in their world, including movies (Noovie Backlot and Noovie Genius), music (Noovie Soundcheck), trivia (Name That Movie), local (Noovie Local, powered by ScoreStream), and more. 

• | Segment three typically begins approximately 21 minutes prior to the advertised show time and features primarily 15 or 30-second local, regional, or national spot advertisements by individual theaters, or across an entire Designated Market Area (“DMA”)® or geographic region, as well as a long-form entertainment content segment from one of our content partners.


• | Segment two begins approximately 16 minutes prior to the advertised show time and features primarily national, national spot and regional advertisements, which generally range between 15 to 90 seconds, as well as a long-form entertainment content segment from one of our content partners. This segment also includes a 50-second Noovie ARcade slot where audiences have the opportunity to play our featured interactive augmented reality (“AR”) game on the big screen using their mobile phones.


• | Segment one runs closest to the advertised show time at approximately 10 minutes prior to the advertised show time and features primarily national advertisements, which are generally 30 or 60 seconds, as well as a long-form entertainment content segment from one of our content partners. Segment one also includes an advertisement for the founding members’ beverage supplier and a public service announcement (“PSA”).

National, Regional and Local Advertising—Our cinema advertising business has a diverse customer base, consisting of national, regional and local advertisers. National and regional on-screen advertising in Noovie is sold on a cost per thousand (“CPM”) basis to national and regional clients. We generally sell our national advertising units across our national network by film rating or groups of ratings, or by individual film or film genre grouping. This ability to target various groups of films offers national advertisers a way to target specific audience demographics at various price points and overall cost levels, which we believe expands the number of potential clients. Local advertising is sold on a per-screen, per-week basis. 
Noovie pre-show inventory is also available in the FreeWheel Advertisers (formerly known as STRATA) and Mediaocean systems, media buying and selling software which allows advertising agencies to buy cinema advertising in the “National Spot TV” marketplace where advertising is purchased by national advertisers in several markets of their own selection. Being able to buy both TV and cinema locally in the National Spot TV marketplace makes it significantly easier for agencies to include cinema in the media mix for their clients and allows us to tap into the pool of advertising dollars budgeted for National Spot TV.  
We sell advertising time in both the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming year, and by purchasing in advance, lock in the advertising rates (CPM’s) they will pay. Many upfront advertising commitments include options whereby advertisers may reduce purchase commitments. In the scatter market, advertisers buy advertising closer to the time when the advertisements will be run, which often results in a pricing premium compared to the upfront rates. The mix between the upfront and scatter markets is based upon a number of factors, such as pricing, demand for advertising time and economic conditions. The demand in the scatter market then impacts the pricing achieved for our remaining advertising inventory. Scatter market pricing can vary through-out the year and from upfront pricing.
From February 13, 2007 through December 27, 2018, 572 national advertisers across a wide variety of industries have advertised with us. During the year ended December 27, 2018, we derived 71% of our advertising revenue from national clients (including advertising agencies that represent our clients) and 24% of our advertising revenue from thousands of regional and local advertisers across the country (including advertising agencies that represent these clients).
Content. Beyond the Noovie-branded content at the beginning of the pre-show, the majority of our entertainment and advertising content segments are provided to us by content partners. Under the terms of the contracts, our content partners create original long-form entertainment content segments that are entertaining, informative or educational in nature exclusively for the Noovie program and make commitments to buy a portion of our advertising inventory at a specified CPM over a one or two-year period with options to renew, exercisable at the content partner’s option.  The original content produced by these content partners typically features behind-the-scenes looks at the “making-of” feature films, upcoming broadcasts, cable television shows, or technology products. In 2018, the content partner segments were approximately 90 seconds in length.
PSA. In 2018, we had three agreements to exhibit a 40-second courtesy “silence your cell phone” PSA reminding moviegoers to silence their cell phones and refrain from texting during feature films. Two of these agreements continue through 2019 and one expired at the end of 2018. We signed an additional two new agreements for 2019. 
3-D Advertising. We also sell 3-D advertising, which runs prior to select 3-D feature films. These 3-D advertisements are placed at the end of the Noovie pre-show, after a message instructing the movie audience to put on their 3-D glasses, so that the glasses can be kept on throughout the remainder of Noovie, the trailers and the 3-D feature film to provide for a better experience. 3-D advertisements provide average advertising CPMs that are higher than average two-dimensional (“2-D”) 
6

pricing primarily because 3-D advertisements have heightened recall when compared to 2-D advertisements based on third-party research.  
Noovie ARcade. Starting in 2018, movie audiences nationwide can play big screen interactive AR games on their mobile phones by using Noovie ARcade, the revolutionary new companion app for the Noovie pre-show. During 2018, Noovie ARcade games included Cinevaders, Emoji Escape, The Horror Experience, Ralph Breaks the Internet (our first studio collaboration) and Hollywood Highway. Noovie ARcade games and other Noovie AR experiences can be sponsored by advertisers or customized by brands to create unique and engaging experiences for movie audiences.
Name That Movie. During 2017, we entered into a licensing agreement authorizing the production of Name That Movie trivia segments for our Noovie pre-show, social media channels and future digital properties in order to further entertain and engage moviegoers. We also offer the opportunity for our advertising customers to sponsor the Name That Movie segments and incorporate advertising into the game.
Beverage Advertising—We have a long-term agreement to exhibit the advertising of the founding members’ beverage concessionaires. Under the ESAs, up to 90 seconds of the Noovie program can be sold to the founding members to satisfy their on-screen advertising commitments under their beverage concessionaire agreements at a rate intended to approximate a market rate (per the ESA, the annual CPM change equals the prior year annual percentage change in the advertising CPM charged to unaffiliated third parties during segment one (closest to the advertised show time) of the Noovie pre-show, limited to the highest advertising CPM being then-charged by NCM LLC). Each of the founding members has a relationship with a beverage concessionaire supplier under which they are obligated to provide on-screen advertising time as part of their agreement to purchase branded beverages sold in their theaters. During 2018, we sold 60 seconds to two of the founding members and 30 seconds to one of the founding members. During 2018, the beverage concessionaire revenue from the founding members’ beverage agreements was 7% of our total revenue. In the instance of certain theaters that are acquired by the founding members but are not incorporated into our network because of an existing on-screen advertising agreement with an alternative provider, we remain entitled to these beverage payments under the terms of the ESA which are treated as a reduction to the intangible asset and not classified as revenue.
Theater Circuit Messaging—The Noovie program also includes time slots for the founding members and network affiliates to advertise various activities associated with the operations of the theaters, including concessions, online ticketing partners, gift card and loyalty programs, special events presented by the theater operator and vendors of services provided to theaters, so long as such promotion is incidental to the vendor’s service or products sold in the theater. This time is provided to the theater operator at no charge and generally includes 45 seconds within 15 minutes prior to the advertised show time, 15 seconds of which will be placed within 12 minutes prior to the advertised show time, and the remainder placed elsewhere during the Noovie pre-show at our discretion.
Lobby Advertising
Lobby Entertainment Network —Our LEN is a network of video screens strategically located throughout the lobbies of all digitally equipped founding members’ theaters, as well as the majority of our network affiliates' theaters. As of December 27, 2018, our LEN had 3,039 screens in 1,568 theaters in our network. The LEN screens are placed in high-traffic locations such as concession stands, box offices and other waiting areas.  Programming on our LEN consists of an approximately 30-minute loop of branded entertainment content segments created specifically for the lobby with advertisements running between each segment. We have the scheduling flexibility to send different LEN programming to each theater through our DCN, and the same program is displayed simultaneously on all LEN screens within a given theater, which we believe provides the maximum impact for our advertisers. We sell national and local advertising on the LEN individually or bundled with on-screen or other lobby promotions.
The LEN programming includes up to two minutes for founding members’ advertisements to promote activities associated with the operation of the theaters, including concessions, online ticketing partners, gift card and loyalty programs, special events presented by the theater operator and vendors of services provided to theaters, so long as such promotion is incidental to the vendor’s service or products sold in the theater. Additionally, subject to certain limitations, the LEN programming includes up to two minutes (one minute of which we provide to the founding members at no cost and one minute of which the founding members may purchase) to promote certain non-exclusive cross-marketing relationships entered into by the theater operators for the purpose of increasing theater attendance, which we call “strategic programs.”
Under the terms of the ESAs, the founding members also have the right to install a second network of additional screens in their theater lobbies which would not display our LEN programming, but would be used to promote strategic programs or products sold in their theater concessions, bars and dining operations, online ticketing partner promotions, gift card and loyalty programs, and special events presented by the founding member and vendors of services provided to theaters, so long as such promotion is incidental to the vendor’s service.
Lobby Promotions
7

We also sell a wide variety of advertising and promotional products in theater lobbies. These products can be sold individually or bundled with on-screen, LEN or digital advertising. Lobby promotions typically include:

• | advertising on concession items such as beverage cups, popcorn bags and kids’ trays;


• | coupons and promotional materials, which are customizable by film and are distributed to ticket buyers at the box office or as they exit the theater;


• | tabling displays, product demonstrations and sampling;


• | touch-screen display units and kiosks; and


• | signage throughout the lobbies, including posters, banners, counter cards, danglers, floor mats, standees and window clings.

Under the terms of the ESAs, the founding members may conduct a limited number of lobby promotions at no charge in connection with strategic programs that promote motion pictures; however, such activities will not reduce the lobby promotions inventory available to us.
Our ability to provide in-lobby marketing and promotional placements in conjunction with our cinema advertising products allows us to offer integrated marketing solutions to advertisers that provide multiple touchpoints with theater patrons throughout the movie-going experience, which we believe is a competitive advantage over other national media platforms.
Digital Advertising
At its core, Noovie is NCM’s pre-show that audiences experience before the movie, but Noovie also stretches beyond the theater as an integrated digital ecosystem delivering entertaining content, purposeful commerce, and interactive gaming opportunities. The Noovie pre-show serves as a “trailer” for the Noovie digital experience, driving movie audiences from the big screen to NCM’s digital properties and back again. We believe that by creating a compelling consumer experience for moviegoers, we can further enhance the marketability of our product offerings to our advertising customers. The Noovie digital ecosystem is designed to provide digital advertising inventory and capture exclusive first party data and includes:
Gaming – During 2018, we launched our Noovie ARcade app, bringing augmented reality gaming to the big screen and beyond, with nearly 1.5 million downloads as of December 27, 2018. We expect to deploy Noovie Trivia web and mobile apps throughout 2019, allowing customers to play a variety of trivia games in various formats, such as a collection of card-based movie trivia mini-games. We expect the games to interact with and enhance onscreen promotions and also be playable by customers outside of the theaters. During 2017, we acquired Fantasy Movie League, a box office predictions game that combines the fierce competition of fantasy sports with the world of entertainment and movies. Fantasy Movie League can currently be played online at FantasyMovieLeague.com or through the Fantasy Movie League iOS and Android apps, with over 200,000 downloads of the app as of December 27, 2018. Fantasy Movie League is promoted on-screen in our Noovie pre-show to help grow its gaming audience.
Noovie.com – NCM launched an early-access version of Noovie.com in late 2018 as a search and discovery platform where audiences can discover new movies, watch the latest trailers, find theaters and showtimes, and buy tickets. NCM expects to launch the full-version in the first quarter of 2019. In subsequent releases, Noovie.com will be a smart movie guide and; a place fans turn to decide what to watch next, whether in theater or at home, as well as, a community hub for fans to connect, discover, and share their love of movies. The Noovie digital portfolio of products will also be a source of fun arcade, trivia and fantasy box office games, and unique content to keep fans entertained on the big and small screens representing all that is new and fun with movies.
NCM advertisers will also benefit as Noovie.com will connect brands to valuable movie audiences around engaging and bespoke digital experiences. Noovie.com will be a natural companion to the Noovie pre-show extending the brand, re-enforcing the on-screen offering, and creating valuable cross-platform advertising opportunities.
Cinema Accelerator – In addition to our ad-supported consumer-facing digital products, our Cinema Accelerator digital product expands cinema advertising beyond the theater environment to reach digitally-connected moviegoers before and after the movie experience, both online and on mobile devices. Cinema Accelerator identifies moviegoers through exclusive first party data sources including geo-location services, and micro-event data for the moviegoers that enter the theaters in our network. Using the moviegoer as our filter, we can target specific demographics, genres or layer on other data to provide our clients with a match against their target audience. Digital ads are then distributed through multiple channels, including online and mobile banners, online and mobile pre-roll video and social media newsfeeds through our owned and operated ad inventory as well as third party ad inventory to reach moviegoers wherever they may be seeking entertainment information and content.  
We sell NCM’s digital products through a digital sales group that is embedded as part of our national and local sales organizations to enable collaborative, integrated selling. We believe that our new and upcoming digital products can be sold 
8

with additional in-theater advertisements as integrated marketing packages as discussed in “Business – Our Strategy”. We plan to continue to invest in our digital platform in 2019.
Our Network
In-theater advertising and entertainment content is distributed across NCM LLC’s national theater network — the largest digital in-theater network in North America. Through the use of our proprietary DCN and Digital Content Software, we are able to schedule, deliver, play and reconcile advertising and entertainment content for Noovie and the LEN on a national, regional, local, theater and auditorium level.
The DCN is the combination of a satellite distribution network and a terrestrial management network.  We also employ a variety of technologies that aid in distribution where satellite delivery is not available to provide uninterrupted service to our network of theaters. The DCN is controlled by our Network Operations Center (“NOC”) located in NCM’s headquarters in Centennial, CO, which operates 20 hours a day, seven days a week to proactively monitor and manage our network. NCM's DCN dynamically controls the quality, placement, timing of playback and completeness of content within specific auditoriums, and it also allows us to monitor and initiate repairs to the equipment in our digital network of theaters.
Advertising and entertainment content for our Noovie pre-show and LEN is uploaded from our Network Operations Center to our satellite distribution network and is delivered via multicast technology to the theaters in our network and received by our Alternative Content Engine.  The Alternative Content Engine holds the content until displayed in specified theater auditoriums and lobbies according to contract terms. Each theater auditorium and lobby has a hardware and software architecture that controls the content to be shown. After playback of content, confirmation of playback is returned via satellite to our Network Operations Center to be included in “post” reports provided to our advertising clients.
According to Nielsen Cinema Audience Reports for 2018, more than 750 million moviegoers annually attend theaters that are currently under contract to present the Noovie pre-show, including the founding members and over 50 leading national and regional theater network affiliates. A summary of the screens and theaters in our advertising network is set forth in the table below:
Our Network
(As of December 27, 2018)

 | Advertising Network
 | Theaters | Total Screens | | % of Total
Founding Members | 1,259 | | 16,768 | | 79.2 | %
Network Affiliates | 471 | | 4,404 | | 20.8 | %
Total | 1,730 | | 21,172 | | 100.0 | %

As of December 27, 2018, our Noovie pre-show was displayed on 100% of network movie screens using digital projectors, with approximately 98% of those screens receiving content through our DCN, representing approximately 98% of our total network attendance. As of December 27, 2018, 20,079, or 95%, of 21,172 total digital screens are equipped with more powerful digital cinema projectors, with the remainder comprised of LCD projectors. Those screens not connected to our DCN display national and regional advertisements on digital projectors with content delivered on USB drives that are shipped to the theaters via overnight delivery services.
Our Team
We had 536 employees as of December 27, 2018. Our employees are located in our Centennial, Colorado headquarters, in our advertising sales offices in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Detroit, our digital development offices in Los Angeles and New York, and our software development office in Minneapolis.  We also have many local advertising account executives and field maintenance technicians that work primarily from their homes throughout the U.S.  None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees.
Competition
Our advertising business competes in the estimated $212 billion U.S. advertising industry with many other forms of marketing media, including television, radio, print, internet, mobile and outdoor display advertising. While cinema advertising represents a small portion of the overall advertising industry today, we believe it is well-positioned to capitalize on the shift of advertising spending away from traditional media, in particular television where consumers can skip advertisements through DVRs and other technology, to newer and more targeted forms of media.
Our advertising business also competes with many other providers of cinema advertising, which vary substantially in size. As the largest cinema advertising network in the U.S., we believe that we are able to generate economies of scale, operating 
9

efficiencies and enhanced opportunities for our clients to reach an engaged movie audience on both a national and local level to allow us to better compete for premium video dollars in the larger advertising marketplace.
Competitive Strengths
We believe that several strengths position us well to compete in an increasingly fragmented media landscape.
Preferred National Advertising Network
We believe that our cinema advertising network is an attractive option for advertisers on both a national and local level and delivers measurable results for our clients that are comparable, and preferred, to the television, online and mobile, or other video advertising networks that we compete against in the marketplace.
Extensive National Market Coverage—Our contractual agreements with our founding members and network affiliates provide long-term exclusive access (subject to limited exceptions) to sell cinema advertising across the largest network of digitally-equipped theaters in the U.S. This allows us to offer advertisers the broad reach and national scale that they need to effectively reach their target audiences.
As of December 27, 2018:

• | Our advertising network consisted of 21,172 screens (16,768 operated by the founding members) located in 1,730 theaters (1,259 operated by the founding members) in 47 states and the District of Columbia, including each of the top 25 and 50 DMAs®, and 187 DMAs® in total;


• | Approximately 73% of our screens (approximately 77% of our attendance) were located within the top 50 U.S. DMAs® and approximately 32% of our screens (approximately 37% of our attendance) were located within the top 10 U.S. DMAs®. Theaters within our network represented approximately 69%, 67%, and 67% of the total theater attendance in theaters that present advertising in the top 10, top 25 and top 50 U.S. DMAs®, respectively and 62% for all DMAs®, providing a very attractive platform for national advertisers who want exposure in larger markets or on a national basis;


• | Our total annual network theater attendance was approximately 705.1 million (approximately 580.8 million from the founding members), which increased 7.5% compared to 2017. Our network of modern theaters represented approximately 58% of the total U.S. theater attendance, with some of the most highly attended theaters in the industry, as measured by screens per location and attendance per screen; 


• | The average screens per theater in our network was 12.2 screens, 1.7 times the U.S. theater industry average, and the aggregate annual attendance per screen of theaters included in our network during 2018 was 33,303, versus the U.S. theater industry average attendance per indoor screen of 29,985, using metrics reported by the National Association of Theatre Owners (“NATO”).

Scalable, State-of-the-Art Digital Content Distribution Technology—Our use of the combination of satellite and terrestrial network technology, combined with the design and functionality of our Digital Content Software and Network Operations Center infrastructure, makes our network efficient and scalable and also allows us to target specific audiences and provide advertising scheduling flexibility and reporting. We offer short lead times by accelerating the delivery time of media from proposal to on-screen across our network of movie theaters nationwide. National, local and regional advertisers are able to run their ads in the Noovie pre-show less than 72 hours following the proposal (comparable to TV), which is a significant improvement over the cinema industry’s traditional turn-around time frame and gives businesses that rely on time-sensitive promotional advertising strategies, such as car dealerships, retail stores and quick service restaurants, the opportunity to take advantage of the power of cinema.
This scalability of our distribution technology has allowed us to expand our cinema advertising network with minimal additional capital expenditures or personnel, and we expect to benefit from this scalability in the future as we add new theaters from the founding members, our existing network affiliate relationships and the addition of new network affiliates.
Millennials, Content and Data
We believe that the Millennial audiences (age 18-34) in our network of theaters, the premium content of Hollywood films and our Noovie pre-show, and the advances we have made in cinema advertising data all give us a competitive advantage in the media marketplace.
Access to a Highly Attractive, Engaged Audience—We offer advertisers the ability to reach highly-coveted target demographics, including young, affluent, and educated moviegoers. According to Nielsen Cinema Audience Reports for 2018, 53% of the NCM LLC audience were between the ages of 12-34, compared to 56% in 2017. Further, 46% of our moviegoers have a household income greater than $100,000 (versus 32% of the general population) and 41% have received a Bachelor’s degree or higher (versus 31% of the general population) according to the 2018 Doublebase GfK MRI Study.
10

Because of the impact of cinema’s state-of-the-art immersive video and audio presentation, we also believe that movie audiences are highly engaged with the advertising and entertainment content that they view in our pre-show theater environment. According to industry research, cinema advertising has significantly higher recall rates than advertising shown on television and cinema is one of the few advertising mediums where the ability to bypass the marketing messages is limited.
Innovative, Branded Pre-Feature Content—The film content created by Hollywood studios is considered by many to be the finest entertainment content in the world, which creates a highly-desirable advertising environment for brands. We believe that our entertainment and advertising pre-feature program, Noovie, provides a high-quality entertainment experience for theater audiences and an effective marketing platform for advertisers. By partnering with leading media, entertainment, technology and other companies, we are able to provide better original content for our audience and more impact for the advertiser. Because we offer local and national “pods” within our Noovie pre-show, we are consistent with the placement of ads on television networks, which allows us to be more easily integrated into traditional sight-sound-and-motion media buys. 
Prime Audience Measurability and Targeting—As with many other advertising mediums, we are measured by third-party research companies such as Nielsen Holdings PLC that provide us with the percentage of the total attendance in their seats at various times during our Noovie pre-show. What differentiates us from other advertising mediums, however, is that we also receive monthly attendance information by film, by rating and by screen for all of the founding member theaters and by our fiscal accounting month ("flight"), and by location for the theaters operated by our network affiliates, which allows us to report the actual audience size for each showing of a film, including our Noovie pre-show. We believe that the ability to provide this level of detailed information to our clients gives us a distinct competitive advantage over traditional media platforms whose measurement is based only on extrapolations of a very small sample of the total audience.
Integrated Marketing and Digital Products—Our ability to bundle our on-screen advertising opportunities with integrated lobby, online and mobile marketing products allows us to offer advertisers multiple touchpoints to reach movie audiences before, during and after the film to execute true 360-degree marketing programs. We believe these multiple marketing impressions throughout the entire entertainment experience allows our advertisers to extend the exposure for their brands and products and create a more engaging relationship with movie audiences in every stage of their movie journey. Additionally, our digital products provide us with valuable, exclusive first party data which can be utilized by our advertising customers through our Cinema Accelerator product to better reach their target audience with higher degrees of accuracy and measure business outcomes more accurately.
In 2018, we continued to invest in the development of our cloud-based Data Management Platform which we believe will allow us to provide even more robust audience insights and analytics to our clients. To further enhance the connection between brands and movie audiences, we accumulate audience data from several sources within our Data Management Platform.  This audience data is then leveraged for another level of targeting of ad campaigns and can also serve to deliver closed-loop attribution reporting. We expect to continue to enhance the capabilities of the platform in 2019 by continuing to gather first-party data through our Noovie digital products, as well as additional data sources and segments.
Contractual Theater Circuit Partner and Advertiser Relationships—Our exclusive multi-year contractual relationships with our founding members and network affiliates allow us to offer advertisers a national network with the scale, flexibility and targeting to meet their marketing needs. Our exclusive multi-year contractual relationships with our content partners and PSA sponsors, as well as our agreements to satisfy the founding members’ on-screen marketing obligations to their beverage concessionaires, provide us with a significant upfront revenue commitment, accounting for approximately 26% of our total revenue for the year ended December 27, 2018. In addition, our participation in the annual advertising upfront marketplace has allowed us to secure significant annual upfront commitments from national advertisers looking to secure premium cinema inventory.
Strong Operating Margins with Limited Capital Requirements—Our annual operating income and Adjusted OIBDA margins have been consistently strong, ranging from approximately 33.1% to 38.7% and 46.5% to 51.5%, respectively over the last five years.  (Refer to “Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Notes to the Selected Historical Financial and Operating Data” for a discussion of the calculation of Adjusted OIBDA margin, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, and the reconciliation to operating income.)  In addition, due to the network equipment investments made in recent years by the founding members and network affiliates in new and acquired theaters and the requirements in the ESAs for the founding members to make future investments for equipment replacements, and the scalable nature of our Network Operations Center and other infrastructure, we do not expect to make major capital investments to grow our operations as our network of theaters expands.
Our capital expenditures have ranged from approximately 2% to 4% of revenues over the last five years. For the year ended December 27, 2018, our capital expenditures were $15.4 million, of which only $0.9 million primarily related to investments in network equipment to add new network affiliate theaters and $6.9 million was related to investments in our digital infrastructure investment. We expect a consistent level of investment within our digital products over the next few years in line with our strategy to expand and scale an integrated digital business as further discussed below. We believe our expected level of Adjusted OIBDA and capital expenditures should provide us with the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue the 
11

further expansion of our national theater network, invest in our digital products and other growth opportunities, opportunistically repay NCM LLC's debt and continue to make dividend payments to our stockholders.
Our Strategy
We are continuing to pursue a growth strategy that involves growing our network affiliate partnerships, growing on-screen revenue, expanding digital product offerings, ensuring that we are the first choice for our customers, developing our people and capabilities, and allocating resources to strategy.
Grow the Business
We intend to focus on growing our business in the following strategic ways.
Grow Affiliate Partnerships—Our relationships with our exhibitors are a key and renewed focus of our business. In 2018, our Affiliate Partnership team is dedicated to serving the needs of our founding member theater circuits and our more than 54 network affiliates nationwide. We continuously seek to expand our theater circuit customer base and add new network affiliate partners to our network that will allow us to increase our revenue by increasing the number of impressions we have available to sell to advertisers. It is also important to note that, under the terms of the ESAs and common unit adjustment agreement with the founding members and our network affiliate agreements, all new theaters built or acquired (subject to existing advertising sales agreements) by the founding members or network affiliates will become part of our network. Since NCM, Inc.’s February 2007 IPO, the founding members have added approximately 3,700 net new screens and 50 network affiliates have been added to our network with approximately 3,500 screens. During 2018, we added 322 net screens from the founding members and network affiliates. We believe this expansion continued to improve our geographic coverage and enhance our ability to compete with other national advertising mediums, which allows our exhibitor customers to maximize the advertising value of their audiences.
Grow On-Screen Revenue—We plan to continue our successful strategy of selling our inventory like premium video in the larger advertising marketplace, once again utilizing the upfront advertising marketplace to maximize our use of inventory. This strategy has yielded positive results, and we believe that the increased market awareness among media buyers and clients raises our credibility as a medium and may allow us to gain upfront commitments traditionally made exclusively to cable and broadcast television networks, and more recently online and mobile networks. Further, we believe it will help increase our share of video advertising spending by increasing the number of clients and client industries that buy our network. Over time, this greater shift toward more upfront commitments will allow us to bundle several flights throughout the year and stabilize month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter CPM volatility by increasing overall inventory utilization and balancing that utilization throughout the year. Consistent with the television industry upfront booking practices, a portion of our upfront commitments have cancellation options or options to reduce the amount that advertisers may purchase that could reduce what is ultimately spent by clients that have made upfront commitments and we would need to rely on the scatter market to replace those commitments.
We also intend to increase our market share of local and regional advertising spending by aggressively pursuing further integration into agency planning and buying tools, such as our relationships with FreeWheel Advertisers and Mediaocean, leaders in media buying and selling software, which allow agencies to buy cinema advertising in the "National Spot TV" marketplace. By making NCM an option in these systems and other industrywide and in-house agency planning and buying systems, we believe we can remove barriers to entry by incorporating cinema into media plans and tapping into new pools of advertising dollars.
We also plan to continue to re-imagine our Noovie pre-show to build the Noovie brand, enhance the audience experience, and maintain its commercial value.
Expand and Scale an Integrated Digital Business—We intend to continue to upgrade our existing digital offerings (Fantasy Movie League, Noovie ARcade, Noovie.com, Noovie Trivia and Cinema Accelerator) as well as expand our Noovie digital ecosystem to support our core on-screen business by introducing additional products that will engage movie audiences with exclusive and unique content, commerce, and gaming opportunities. During 2018 we released our Noovie ARcade app, which allows us to capture exclusive first party data on our audience. During 2018 we also began development of our Noovie Trivia app and Noovie.com which are expected to be released in 2019. Cinema Accelerator currently identifies moviegoers’ mobile devices as they enter a theater, and re-engages them with a brand’s messages wherever they are consuming content — on mobile devices, social media, or online. As we continue to create our own NCM owned-and-operated ad inventory across our suite of digital products, we also plan to build our own foundational capabilities for digital ad buying, selling and serving through the development of “Cinema Accelerator 2.0,” an enhanced version of our existing Cinema Accelerator product. This upgraded version will offer increased and better quality first party data.
Be the First Choice for Customers
12

Our approach is to always strive to be the first choice for our customers, including our advertising and agency customers, our exhibitors, and movie studios. By offering innovative on-screen, in-lobby and digital cinema advertising solutions to connect brands to unique, engaged and valuable young adult audiences at scale, we believe we can offer our advertiser and agency customers a valuable and effective marketing option that cannot be duplicated in any other medium. As the first choice for our customers, we can continue to expand our advertising client base and increase our market share of U.S. advertising spending. Our national sales team was successful in adding 31 clients in 2018 that were first time clients or had not advertised with us since our IPO. These new clients added in 2018 included companies in the electronic stores, financial products and services, game and toy stores, health and fitness, home products, home video, hotels and resorts, import auto, insurance, internet site, liquor, movie studios, office supply, oil companies, pet food and supply, pharmaceutical, prepared foods, restaurants, telecom software, transportation, and video game software industries. Despite this growth, we believe there are still thousands of potential clients that currently advertise on other mediums such as television but have yet to advertise on our network. These strategies are designed to expand our relationships with existing advertising clients and broaden our advertising client base in new and existing client industries.
Develop People and Capabilities
Our success is tied to the quality of our management and staff.  In order to ensure that we retain and attract high quality personnel, we seek to foster and maintain a culture that focuses on teamwork, personal growth, inclusion and diversity. We will continue to make meaningful investments in internal and external training programs for our management and staff to ensure that our personnel have, or build, the skillsets necessary to support our evolution and growth objectives. We have also adopted a succession plan that includes short-term and long-term planning elements to allow us to successfully continue operations should any of our senior management team become unavailable to us, such as when our Chief Executive Officer resigned in November 2018. 
Resources to Strategy
We will continue to assess and eliminate off-target resources for a strategic focus on the future of NCM. We will be allocating resources to continuity and growth, with a focus from our staff on financial responsibility with company resources.
Intellectual Property Rights
We have been granted a perpetual, royalty-free license from the founding members to use certain proprietary software for the delivery of digital advertising and other content through our DCN to screens in the U.S. We have made improvements to this software since the IPO date and we own those improvements exclusively, except for improvements that were developed jointly by us and the founding members.
We have secured U.S. trademark registrations for NCM, National CineMedia, NCM Media Networks and Noovie. We also have U.S. trademark registrations pending for What's Noovie. It is our practice to defend our trademarks and other intellectual property rights, including the associated goodwill, from infringement by others. We are aware that other persons or entities may use names and marks containing variations of our registered trademarks and other marks and trade names. Potentially, claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, such as trademark infringement, could be brought against us by the users of those other names and marks. If any such infringement claim were to prove successful in preventing us from either using or prohibiting a competitor’s use of our registered trademarks or other marks or trade names, our ability to build brand identity could be negatively impacted.
Government Regulation
Currently, we are not subject to regulations specific to the sale and distribution of cinema advertising. We are subject to federal, state and local laws that govern businesses generally such as wage and hour and worker compensation laws as well as federal and state privacy, information security and consumer protection-related laws and regulations.
