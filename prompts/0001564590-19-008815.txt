 Customers
 We primarily work directly with original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) to define the right solutions for their unique applications, including the design of custom parts with unique part numbers. Actual sales of production parts may be directly to the OEM or through either their designated contract manufacturers ("CMs") or through franchised distributors of our products. As a result, we have highly-skilled sales engineers who work directly with the designers and program managers at its OEMs, providing a high-level of engineering support at all points within the process.
 In 2018, our largest customer, an electronics contract manufacturing company in the aerospace and defense markets, accounted for $4,436,000, or 17.8%, of the Company's total revenues, compared to $3,744,000, or 16.7%, in 2017.
 As of December 31, 2018, four of our largest customers accounted for approximately $1,043,000, or 30%, of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2017, four of our largest customers accounted for approximately $1,100,000, or 32%, of accounts receivable. The insolvency of any of these customers could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.
 Research and Development
 Utilizing our understanding of market requirements, we employ a disciplined approach to capital allocation when selecting new product development projects. A cross-functional team comprised of engineering, marketing, operations, sales and finance reviews the merits of specific projects, seeking to invest in products that will exceed a specific return on investment level and a payback expectation within one to two years. In addition, the team considers the inherent value of intellectual property that each project presents with consideration for technical roadmap objectives.
 Research and development expense was approximately $1,947,000 and $1,827,000 in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and will remain a significant part of the Company's efforts to revitalize our intellectual property position.
 Marketing and Sales
 We have a highly skilled team of sales engineers who work in tandem with a worldwide network of more than 30 independent external manufacturer representatives and franchised electronics distributors to market and sell our products. An important part of the sales process is gaining qualification of specific products from the OEM, confirming suitability for use in a specific system design, which is commonly referred to as a "design-win." Through direct contact with our clients and through our representative network, we are able to understand the needs of the marketplace and then guide our product development process to allocate resources to meeting those requirements.

Seasonality
 Our business is not seasonal, although shipment schedules may be affected by the production schedules of our customers or their CMs based on regional practices or customs.
Domestic Revenues
 Our domestic revenues were $18,673,000 in 2018, or 75.1% of total consolidated revenues, compared to $16,090,000, or 71.8% of total consolidated revenues, in 2017.
 International Revenues
 Our international revenues were $6,197,000 in 2018, or 24.9% of total consolidated revenues, compared to $6,313,000, or 28.2% of total consolidated revenues, in 2017. In each of 2018 and 2017, these revenues were derived mainly from customers in Asia, with significant sales in Malaysia. We avoid significant currency exchange risk by transacting and settling substantially all of our international sales in United States dollars.
Order Backlog
 Our order backlog was $17,506,000 and $11,713,000 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The backlog of unfilled orders includes amounts based on signed contracts as well as agreed letters of intent, which we have determined are firm orders and likely to proceed. Although backlog represents only firm orders that are considered likely to be fulfilled within the 12 months following receipt of the order, cancellations or scope adjustments may and do occur.
 Order backlog is adjusted quarterly to reflect project cancellations, deferrals, revised project scope and cost. We expect to fill our entire 2018 order backlog in 2019, but cannot provide assurances as to what portion of the order backlog will be fulfilled in a given year.
 Raw Materials
 Most raw materials used in the production of our products are available in adequate supply from a number of sources and the prices of these raw materials are relatively stable. However, some raw materials, including printed circuit boards, quartz and certain metals including steel, aluminum, silver, gold, tantalum and palladium, are subject to greater supply fluctuations and price volatility, as experienced in recent years. In general, we have been able to include some cost increases in our pricing, but in some cases our margins were adversely impacted.
Competition
 We design, manufacture and market products for the generation, synchronization and control of time and frequency as well as spectrum control products. There are numerous domestic and international manufacturers who are capable of providing custom-designed products comparable in quality and performance to our products. Our competitive strategy begins with our focus on niche markets where precise specification and reliability are the major requirements. Competitors in our electronic components segment include, but are not limited to, Vectron International (a division of Knowles Corporation), K&L Microwave (a division of Dover Corporation), Symmetricom (a division of Microsemi Corporation), and Rakon Limited. Competitors in our electronic instruments segment include, but are not limited to, Symmetricom, Spectracom Corporation and Brandywine Communications.
Intellectual Property
 We have no patents, trademarks or licenses that are considered to be significant to our business or operations. Rather, we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineering and technical staff in areas of product design and manufacturing processes, including our staff’s ability to customize products to meet difficult specifications, as well as proprietary know-how and information.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed 308 people, including 146 full-time, and 16 part-time employees, along with 146 contractors. Of this total, the Company has 136 full-time, 15 part-time, and one contract employee within the U.S., with 107 located in Orlando, Florida, 40 in Yankton, South Dakota, and five within its subsidiary PTF in Wakefield,

Massachusetts. The Company has two full-time and one part-time employee in Hong Kong, and eight full-time employees and 145 contractors in Noida, India. None of the Company's employees are represented by a labor union and the Company considers its relationships with employees to be good.
 As an engineering-centric company, nearly 20% of our workforce consists of degreed engineers offering their expertise to product design and process development.
 Environmental
 Our manufacturing operations, products, and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and other chemicals. In addition, more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, both within the United States and internationally, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance that would be associated with these regulations.
 To date, capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company have not been materially affected by compliance with current federal, state, and local laws and regulations (domestic and foreign) relating to the protection of the environment. However, we cannot predict the effect of future laws and regulations.
