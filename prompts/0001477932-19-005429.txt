Distributed Ledger Technology “Blockchain”

Our Distributed Ledger Technology “Blockchain” permits trust to be intrinsically embedded into a technological solution, enabling smooth partnerships and transactions dramatically reducing friction between stakeholders. Our solutions focus primarily within the Health Information Exchange and Telecommunications space.
Workflow Automation

Distributed Ledger Technology “Blockchain” enabled trust improves coordination between various partners, due to a shared view of transactions and liabilities. This in turn permits the elimination of third parties, resulting in cost savings
Audit Trail

Facilitates a single view of data instead of the need for consolidation across various disparate systems. Resulting in reliable audit trails due to the history of all transactions being available in the ledger.
Data Privacy

Provable privacy protects clients’ data from being visible to unauthorized parties in compliance with all of today's HIPPA requirements

Revenue Assurance

Implementation of smart contracts allows for near-instantaneous charging, thus leading to improved revenue assurance and fraud reduction.

Health Information Exchange

DLT Resolution owns RecordsBank.org, a Centralized System for Patients, Lawyers & Insurers to retrieve and access Medical Records. The centralized system and portal is a cloud-based PIPEDA & HIPAA compliant network of Providers and Record Requestors. Utilizing a secure platform, providers will be able to securely exchange records electronically with third-party requestors. Health care providers with proper authorization can also share records with each other. The system works on a fee per record basis with future plans of licensing medical data, stripped of identifiers for medical research.
Addressing a $7 Billion a Year Problem 

In national terms, across the U.S., hospitals spend more than $7 billion annually on customer intake. More than $7 billion, before any sort of medical procedure is done; before a patient even steps out of a waiting room, representing an incredible amount of time and money spent on intake administration.

Despite the adoption of electronic health records (EHR) and health information exchanges (HIE), providers are still mailing and faxing paper records because they have no PIPEDA or HIPAA compliant method to exchange records electronically with these third-party requestors. Based on our research, the Company estimates the current method of exchanging patient health information may cost a single clinician practice approximately $17,000 per year. 

The Company aims to remove these substantial burdens both on an administrative and financial basis. People or firms simply use our secure online request form, pay a small service fee and the Company retrieves, digitizes and stores the records. At this point the requesting client can access the record globally 24 hours a day - 7 days a week to view it or transfer it securely. In fact clients can upload any new records to consolidate and keep all of their records securely in one place.
