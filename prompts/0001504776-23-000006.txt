Item 1. Business
Our Brand
Warby Parker is a mission-driven, lifestyle brand that operates at the intersection of design, technology, healthcare, and social enterprise. We stand for fun, creativity, and doing good in the world. Every day, our team of over 3,000 employees is focused on our mission to inspire and impact the world with vision, purpose, and style (without charging a premium for it). Our ultimate objective is to provide vision for all.
A pioneer of the direct-to-consumer model, Warby Parker is one of the fastest-growing brands at scale in the United States. Through our multichannel business, we have unlocked access to affordable, quality eye care for millions.
Since day one, Warby Parker’s focus on delighting customers and doing good has created a foundation for continuous innovation:
•We aim to provide customers with the highest-quality product possible by designing glasses at our headquarters in New York City, using custom materials, and selling direct to the customer. By cutting out the middleman, we are able to sell our products at a lower price than many of our competitors and pass the savings on to our customers. In addition to lower prices, we introduced simple, unified pricing (glasses starting at $95, including prescription lenses) to the eyewear market.
•We’ve built a seamless shopping experience that meets customers where and how they want to shop, whether that’s on our website, on our mobile app, or in our 200 retail stores. 
•We’ve crafted a holistic vision care offering that extends beyond glasses to include contacts, vision tests and eye exams, vision insurance, and beyond. We leverage leading (and in many cases proprietary) technology to enhance our customers’ experiences, whether it’s to help them find a better-fitting frame using our Virtual Try-On tool, or to update their prescription from home using Virtual Vision Test, our telehealth app.
•We recruit and retain highly engaged, motivated team members who are driven by our commitment to scaling a large, growing business while making an impact and are excited to connect their daily work back to our mission. 
•We are a public benefit corporation focused on positively impacting all stakeholders, and hope to inspire other entrepreneurs and businesses to think along the same lines. We strive to benefit our employees, customers, communities, partners, and the environment by advancing access to eye care and living our core values. Working closely with our nonprofit partners, we distribute glasses to people in need in more than 50 countries globally and many parts of the United States. Over 10 million more people now have the glasses they need to learn, work, and achieve better economic outcomes through our Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program. 
Our Direct-to-Consumer Model
An amazing customer experience at Warby Parker is no accident—it happens when every possible path to our product is as delightful and thoughtful as the next. When we started Warby Parker 13 years ago, there were not many examples of brands that had launched online. Yet we believed that building a digitally native, vertically integrated brand would enable us to circumvent traditional channels, directly build meaningful relationships with consumers, and offer high-quality products at a reasonable price. Since then we have added many additional ways to engage with consumers—from our 200 retail stores to our Virtual Vision Test telehealth app—all with the intention of making the shopping process easy and fun for our customers.
As we continuously seek to elevate the seamless customer experience, we leverage multiple components of our business model, including:
•Customer-First, Direct-to-Consumer. Since our founding, we have built a seamless customer experience, both in store and online, through which we believe we have deepened customer relationships and strengthened brand loyalty. We offer simple, unified pricing often at a lower price than many of our competitors, making the purchase process transparent, easy, and affordable. Our retail stores provide fun, quirky, and stylized environments in which to shop alongside style and fit experts. Our website and mobile app make it quick and easy for our customers to browse, virtually try on, and purchase glasses. All of our 
infrastructure and customer service support our own brand, enabling us to optimize the look and feel of the user experience from browsing and trying on to purchase. Across all of our channels, we have Customer Experience and Retail team members ready to help at a moment’s notice. And whenever we have room to improve, our teams are the first to know; our direct-to-consumer approach helps us to gather real-time customer feedback and act on it more quickly than our non-DTC competitors.
•Sustainable, Predictable Growth. Eye care purchases are predominantly a non-discretionary medical necessity. Prescription eyewear consumers typically replace their glasses every two to two and a half years, while contact lens customers typically reorder every six to 12 months. Given our brand’s strength and replenishment cycle, we believe we have significant opportunity ahead to grow our wallet share, and delight more and more customers. 
•Vertical Integration. We design and sell glasses under our own brand name. Our integrated supply chain consists of owned optical and fulfillment laboratories as well as third-party manufacturing and laboratory partnerships that we have built over the years and gives us control over product quality and fulfillment speed. We do this as we seek to ensure every part of the design, manufacturing, discovery, purchase, and delivery process is consistent with our brand and our commitment to delivering the highest quality products and remarkable customer experiences. In addition, we own data across the entire end-to-end journey that allows us to develop deep customer insights, informing our innovation, and enabling us to create a highly personalized, brand-enhancing experience with each customer. 
•Strong Customer Economics. We track our unit economics at the customer level, which we refer to as customer economics, since our customers shop through multiple channels. Our personalized and differentiated digital and retail store experiences are designed to delight the customer. 
Our Holistic Vision Care Offering
Since our launch, we have expanded our product offering, creating a seamless and convenient shopping experience for customers interested in not only buying eyeglasses but also sunglasses (with or without prescription lenses), light-responsive lenses, blue-light-filtering lenses, contact lenses, and more. We’ve also introduced services like comprehensive eye exams and groundbreaking in-house technologies like Virtual Vision Test and Virtual Try-On that enhance the overall customer experience. This ongoing innovation is driven by our team’s commitment to solving real consumer problems while building a holistic vision care offering that is unparalleled within the market. 
Eyeglasses and Sunglasses
Every pair of Warby Parker glasses and sunglasses is dreamed up in-house, where our team gathers inspiration, sketches designs, and maps out product details for prototyping. On average, we release over 20 new eyewear collections each year, often incorporating patented designs and extended sizing to offer our customers products that not only fit well but look great. As for frame materials, we select premium—from custom-designed cellulose acetate to ultra-lightweight titanium. Our frames come standard with impact-resistant polycarbonate lenses that block 100% of UVA and UVB rays, plus all our glasses lenses are equipped, at no extra cost, with scratch-resistant and anti-reflective coatings. 
Customers can customize their prescription lenses with a variety of options, including single-vision, progressive, light-responsive, blue-light-filtering, and non-prescription lenses. We custom-cut and polish the edges of our lenses, and individually inspect and bench-align each pair before it’s packaged up and sent on its way to the customer. 
Contacts
Warby Parker sells its own brand of contacts, Scout by Warby Parker, as well as third-party contact lenses; this allows us to provide customers a truly comprehensive vision care offering.
Launched in 2019, Scout by Warby Parker contact lenses are a convenient and affordable daily contact option made from a super-moist material that resists drying for lasting hydration and comfort. For an added touch of convenience, each Scout lens comes in an innovative, space-saving flat pack that’s easier to transport and store than a traditional contact blister pack, and uses almost 80% less packaging than traditional daily contact packs. 
Eye Exams and Vision Tests
We offer multiple ways for customers to get prescriptions and keep their vision in tip-top shape. From friendly and knowledgeable in-person exams at 150 of our retail stores to innovative telehealth services like our Virtual Vision Test app, we provide access to convenient and accessible vision services for primary vision care needs through 
optometrists employed either by us or by independent professional corporations or similar entities with whom we have contractual arrangements. Throughout their shopping experience, our patients’ health and happiness is our top priority. 
The Eyewear Market is Large, Growing, and Ripe for Disruption
Large and Growing Market
The U.S. eyewear market is large and growing. The Vision Council defines the U.S. eyewear market as an approximately $76 billion industry(1), as of December 2022, that has exhibited consistent, stable growth across multiple economic cycles, and estimates the U.S. prescription eyeglasses and sunglasses market to be approximately $36 billion. Independent optical retailers made up approximately 40% of all optical retail sales in 2022, while optical retail chains made up the vast majority of the remainder. Globally, the eyewear market was approximately $170 billion in 2022, according to Statista. The industry includes optical retailers’ revenue from the sales of products (including glasses, sunglasses, and contact lenses) and eye care services provided by vision care professionals, including eye exams.
The eyewear industry is resilient to economic cycles given its medical and non-discretionary nature and is defined by durable fundamentals and trends including:
•Most people need vision correction: The Vision Council reported that 82% of adults in the United States were using some form of vision correction as of the third quarter of 2022, equating to approximately 275 million people. In addition, the number of Americans ages 65 and older will nearly double over the next 40 years, reaching 80 million in 2040, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. It is estimated that at least 93% of people aged 65 and older wear corrective lenses, as older adults require more vision correction.
•Consistent replenishment cycle: On average, glasses wearers replace their glasses every two years, according to the Vision Council. Additionally, an estimated 43 million people in the United States wear contact lenses that are typically disposable, replaced on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, driving frequent repurchase. Over 80% of contacts wearers purchase contact lenses at least once per year. 
•Increasing screen time usage: With the rising usage of smartphones, tablets, computers, and other devices, three out of four adults report experiencing digital eye strain at some point during the day, contributing significantly to increased vision correction needs and a steady influx of new customers within the eyewear market.
•Acceleration of e-commerce penetration: While e-commerce penetration is at an all-time high in the U.S. and abroad, it is largely nascent in the eyewear industry, representing approximately 15% of eyewear product sales in 2022.
•Increasing prominence of telehealth: The Vision Council reported that over 50% of people receiving an eye exam would be interested in having a virtual or telehealth eye exam. DTC telehealth is expected to grow by nearly 50% by 2028, or a CAGR of 5.6%, reflecting an evolution of consumer preferences from in-person to remote medical care.
We believe these factors contribute to rising vision correction needs and a steady influx of new customers who expect an exceptional vision care experience. Industry-wide, a significant portion of customers who use prescription glasses or contacts purchase them from their prescriber. By contrast, the majority of our customers have historically obtained their prescriptions from non-Warby Parker doctors, underscoring the opportunity to expand our own optometric and telehealth services and offer these services to more of our customers. While Warby Parker currently has relationships with only a few vision care insurers in the United States, the majority of our optometric services are covered, in part, as out-of-network services by vision care insurers and major carriers. Our telehealth services are not covered by vision insurance, but we believe customers will continue to use our telehealth services given the convenience and modest cost. To the extent we expand to partner with more vision care insurers, we will have to negotiate with each individual insurer for coverage of the cost of our optometric and telehealth services, which may incur additional time, cost, and resources. According to Statista, the industry is projected to accelerate at a rate above GDP, with an outlook of 6.7% CAGR from 2022 to 2026, supported by secular trends.
(1) In 2022, The Vision Council updated its market sizing methodology within the vision care space. It now estimates the total U.S. eyewear market to be approximately $76 billion in size, compared to $43 billion in its 2021 report.
Ripe for Change
The eye care industry has largely been slow to innovate, despite strong and defensible fundamentals. The process of buying eyewear has lacked an engaging customer experience and has historically been defined by:
•Underinvested Shopping Experience. The legacy customer journey largely entails going in person to an optical retailer, browsing frames stored behind locked cases, and feeling overwhelmed by the assortment. Customers rely heavily on a dominant physical footprint with little to no digital counterparts.
•Confusing, Unstandardized, and Opaque Pricing. Beyond selection of frames, the purchase decision involves complex, multi-step decision-making with an emphasis on upselling lens alternatives and coating options. We believe there is also little connection between pricing and quality.
•Unappealing Value Proposition. Glasses have historically only been offered at a premium price point, leaving millions of customers without access to stylish, affordable eyewear. There is often a significant markup at 10 to 20x from manufacture to sale, as products are often burdened by various licensing, wholesale, and retail fees that support the legacy supply chain. Upon checkout, customers often find their vision insurance (if they have it) only covers a portion of their purchase.
•Limited Ongoing Customer Engagement. The eyewear industry has been built to maximize individual transactions versus optimize the customer journey. In addition, a concentrated number of companies license the vast majority of premium eyewear brands sold and often wholesale their products through retailers, so they lack direct connection to their end customers.
The legacy optical industry is highly concentrated amongst a few industry players that have created an illusion of choice for consumers. While there are over 48,000 optical retail stores in the U.S. as of 2022, consumers are often unaware that power is consolidated among a handful of companies, whose influence spans the full eyewear value chain from design, to manufacturing, distribution, retailing, and insurance.
Eyewear is unique as it’s both a style choice (“I want it”) and a medical necessity (“I need it”). The legacy purchase experience, however, has primarily emphasized eyewear’s medical attributes. At Warby Parker, we believe customers should be able to purchase high-quality eyewear online or in an engaging retail store environment with helpful, friendly associates committed to delivering a fun experience, all at a unified and transparent price.
Sustainable Growth Driven by Customer Focus and Innovation
As we aspire towards continued ambitious, sustainable growth, we plan to leverage distinct growth strategies, which include: 
•Strengthening Engagement with Our Existing Customers. As we further expand our products and services, we see a significant opportunity to deepen relationships with our existing customers. Customers who shop our holistic vision offering across product lines and channels tend to convert to highly loyal returning customers, contributing to consistent growth in lifetime value. 
•Growing Brand Awareness. Our brand is integral to the growth of our business and to the implementation of our business expansion strategies. Every aspect of our business is oriented around delighting the customer, which we believe enhances customer loyalty and drives a leading NPS score. Our brand awareness stems from a combination of organic, word-of-mouth marketing, and social media, as well as television, digital, podcasts, and radio. Our low unaided brand awareness illustrates the significant opportunity we have to introduce Warby Parker to new customers.
•Expanding Our Retail Footprint. Stepping into one of our retail stores brings the Warby Parker brand to life; each store showcases our latest product and service offerings while driving brand awareness and total market growth. Our current retail footprint is national and operates across urban and suburban communities with street, lifestyle, and mall locations. Our U.S. retail footprint has a long runway for expansion. Based on analysis we conducted with a third-party research firm, we expect that our retail footprint has room to expand in the U.S. to 900+ retail stores, which is still a fraction of the over 48,000 optical retail stores in the United States as of 2022. We are highly selective and discerning about each retail store we open, and we believe our retail stores embody the brand, are efficient customer acquisition vehicles, and will generate significant free cash flow over time.
•Continuing to Invest in Technology and our Digital Experience. We plan to continue to make strategic investments to enhance our digital offering and capabilities, enabling us to provide a more convenient and seamless customer experience. Our team of strategists and technologists prioritizes innovation while developing proprietary tools in-house, whether it’s our Virtual Try-On, Digital PD Tool (which measures pupillary distance), custom point of sale system, or our Virtual Vision Test telehealth app. 
•Continuing to Enhance Our Design Capabilities. Our in-house eyewear design team regularly prototypes and develops proprietary eyewear designs that aim to differentiate and elevate our brand within the market. This includes working with our partners to develop custom acetates and deliver first-to-market frame constructions. As we continue to enhance our design capabilities, we believe this will be a competitive advantage moving forward. 
•Expanding Our Holistic Vision Care Offering. We plan to continue to build upon our existing products, while selectively introducing new offerings that aim to surprise and delight both new and existing customers. This includes strengthening our offering and position within:
•Glasses. On average, we release over 20 eyewear collections each year; we will continue to scale our core glasses offering by introducing new sizes, shapes, widths, lens offerings, and more to ensure as many people as possible can find a frame that fits, functions, and looks great. 
•Contact Lenses. The contact lens market is estimated at $17.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 and contributed only 7% to Warby Parker net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.
•Eye Exams and Vision Care. The eye exams and vision care market is estimated at $15.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and contributed only 3% to Warby Parker net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.
•Vision Insurance. Vision insurance comprises over 50% of purchases made in the vision care market as of December 31, 2022 and contributed only 4% to Warby Parker net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.
For each of these opportunities, we have established businesses that are growing rapidly and can scale over time.
•Evaluating Potential Expansion into New International Markets. With over 4 billion people globally in need of vision correction, we recognize there is a significant opportunity to introduce customers across the globe to our brand. Expanding internationally would add approximately $100 billion to our total addressable market. As we grow, we will continue our strategy of evaluating opportunities to open distinctive retail stores in select locations and providing our customers with an engaging online experience.
Our Seamless Experience
We offer our customers a seamless customer experience—whether shopping in-person or online—that’s unparalleled within the market. 
E-commerce & Mobile App
Shopping online at Warby Parker is just as seamless an experience as visiting us in person. Our website and mobile app make quick perusing a cinch, and our online quiz helps customers find frames to fill their Home Try-On box based on style, color, and shape preferences, which is ideal for when there’s not a retail store nearby or if you’d prefer to stay home. Customers can even try on glasses virtually using our proprietary Virtual Try-On tool. Plus, our Customer Experience advisors and Social Media team are on standby online via phone, chat, or email to iron out any styling predicaments and answer any questions.
Home Try-On
We started out selling our frames exclusively online—which was a novel concept in 2010. Our Home Try-On program was designed to make it extremely easy and fun for anyone to find the perfect frame, with all the convenience and none of the stress or uncertainty of other online shopping experiences. Customers can pick five of their favorites on our site (or get tailored suggestions after taking a quick quiz) and try them at home for five full days. Oh, and it’s free!
The Home Try-On program is very unique to our business. It is a viral brand awareness program that pays for itself as we maintain an exceptionally high conversion rate from Home Try-On purchases.
Retail Stores
As of December 31, 2022, our retail footprint included 200 retail stores, including 195 locations in the U.S. and 5 locations in Canada. We are located in 39 states or provinces, 142 cities, and 66 Core Markets, and our retail stores are in 47 of the 50 most populous Core Markets in the U.S. Core Market refers to a Core-Based Statistical Area as defined 
by the U.S. Census Bureau. All of our retail stores are corporate-owned, and we have no franchise retail stores, which allows us complete control over the customer experience. 
Our retail stores introduce the brand to new consumers, strengthen relationships with existing customers, and create environments that celebrate the breadth of our vision care offerings, from glasses to contact lenses and eye exams.
Our retail strategy is thoughtful and data-driven, creative and colorful, and consistent with the Warby Parker brand. The keystone to our strategy is ensuring each retail store location—whether on proven, retail-oriented streets or in high-performing shopping centers—communicates the brand in a consistent and engaging manner to all customers, past, current, and potential. 
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
The Warby Parker supply chain is an agile and integrated network that works to get the right order to the right place at the right time. We partner with a large network of more than 30 partners for frame factories, lens and case/kit suppliers, distribution centers, optical laboratories, and freight-forwarding and logistics companies all over the globe. We also leverage our retail locations and in-house optical laboratory in Sloatsburg, New York, and further expanded our network by opening a second in-house optical laboratory in Las Vegas, Nevada, in September 2021.
In addition to fulfilling prescription eyewear orders, our supply chain also supports the Warby Parker Home Try-On program, contacts, sunglasses, gift cards, accessories, and returns fulfillment, as well as the distribution of all goods. These operations are handled out of multiple fulfillment centers in the U.S. 
All of our frames are designed at our New York City headquarters, and we handpick raw materials and the suppliers who have the expertise and skill to bring them to life. These deliberate decisions help us stay true to our original aesthetic vision as well as regulatory and performance results. We work with raw material vendors on proprietary development, in addition to frame suppliers on their production methods and machinery to achieve best-in-class performance standards.
Transparency is a crucial element in our vendor relationships. We work directly with manufacturers and raw material suppliers, most notably in China, Japan, Vietnam, Taiwan, and Italy, so we know exactly where and how our products are being manufactured. We regularly bring Warby Parker liaisons to our partner facilities to help us better support and inspect our vendors in following our manufacturing specifications. Monthly material forecasts allow vendors to prepare for any constraints created by peak business needs and check that they will be able to accommodate demand. In addition, our Vendor Compliance Manual details volume and financial penalties incurred if our preferred material or component suppliers are not used, and quarterly reviews ensure there are no surprises. 
Product Quality
Before a frame becomes a frame, we’re choosing vendors, selecting materials (we’ve been known to develop specialty acetates with the help of incredibly skilled partners), and performing rigorous product testing with the assistance of third-party agencies, all in the name of the highest quality and safety standards. Our eyewear is considered a medical device by the FDA and regulated as such—so, where applicable, we follow the requirements set by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. We also comply with standards set by the American National Standards Institute for prescription eyewear and sunglasses (both prescription and non-prescription). We require our vendors to comply with the European CE standard, and Warby Parker frames are stamped with the certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area.
Vendors may only use raw materials and suppliers recommended by Warby Parker to ensure expected results in final third-party testing; these suppliers must submit either internal or third-party test results for both regulatory and performance parameters well before the product reaches the customer. We partner with international third-party testing agencies to verify the results and to also create additional product performance testing protocols, to make sure our frames are built to last and that they perform beautifully for as long as they are worn. These additional protocols range from exposing our eyeglasses and sunglasses to salt water or air (to see if the metal plating fades or rusts) to checking that components of frames constructed with mixed materials are not shrinking at different rates in extreme temperatures and humidity; this means they’re less susceptible to coming apart. If a frame safety issue is ever suspected, our Product Strategy team will investigate the lot number, time of shipment, and vendor to identify and, if necessary, correct the problem. 
Vendor Accountability
Alongside the independent fair-labor monitoring group Verité, we piloted the Warby Parker Social Compliance Program in 2012 and formalized it for our direct and key indirect suppliers in 2013. All new direct and key indirect suppliers since 
have been screened using our social compliance criteria. All of our active direct suppliers in China and Japan are audited to ensure compliance with our program, and we continue to expand the program to new suppliers. We define active direct suppliers as product suppliers that we directly transact with, that each represent more than 10% of our business, and with which we have purchase orders, inventory shipments, and/or payment transactions within the calendar year.
We are committed to making sure that working conditions throughout our supplier network are safe and that employees are treated with dignity. Our Vendor Code of Conduct outlines our requirements for the fair treatment and compensation of all workers—with which we require all direct suppliers to comply—the intention of which is to ensure that our suppliers adhere to our standards on subjects such as child labor, forced labor, discrimination, harassment and abuse, wages and benefits, overtime, housing, freedom of association, subcontracting, local laws, employee feedback, health and safety, environment, and bribery.
Our Competition
Competition in the eyewear industry is principally on the basis of brand image and recognition, as well as product quality, price, innovation, and style. We believe that we successfully compete on the basis of our highly compelling price point combined with uncompromising quality, differentiated consumer experience, and an authentic brand promise. In addition, we believe our vertically integrated supply chain allows us more effective control over our product and brand. We are also differentiated by our cross-platform, multi-generational creative and marketing strategies that increases brand-awareness and strengthens consumer loyalty. Nearly half the market is fragmented and eyewear is sold through independent optical shops who drive the majority of their revenue through eyewear sales. This is unique in the medical world as it’s one of the only places where a prescribing doctor can sell you the product they prescribe. 
The eyewear market consists of a fragmented retail channel with an imbalance of asset concentration and significant markups. We are in direct competition with large, integrated optical players that have multiple brands and retail banners, such as EssilorLuxottica and VSP. This competition takes place both in physical retail locations as well as online. 
Government Regulation
We are subject to an extensive array of complex laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. The laws and regulations govern many issues related to our business practices, including those regarding vision care, state optical and optometry regulations, licensing, healthcare, fraud and abuse, corporate practice of medicine, contact lens prescriptions, medical device labeling and registration, worker classification, wage and hour, sick pay and leaves of absence, anti-discrimination and harassment, whistleblower protections, background checks, privacy, data security, intellectual property, health and safety, competition, advertising, consumer protection, fees and payments, pricing, product liability and disclosures, personal injury, property damage, communications, unemployment benefits, taxation, unionization and collective bargaining, contracts, arbitration agreements, class action waivers, terms of service, and accessibility of our mobile app or website.
These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, superseded, or amended in a manner that could harm our business. As we expand our business into new markets or introduce new products, features, or offerings into existing markets, regulatory bodies or courts may claim that we are subject to additional requirements, or that we are prohibited from conducting business in certain jurisdictions. For additional information on the laws and regulations applicable to us, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors--Risks related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment.”
Seasonality
Historically, we have observed moderately higher seasonal demand during the month of December due in part to customer usage of health and flexible spending benefits in the final week of the year. Consistent with our policy to recognize revenue upon order delivery, any orders placed at the end of December are recognized as revenue upon delivery, which may occur in the following year, and as such we typically see revenue increase sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of the following year.
Our business has historically experienced a higher proportion of costs in each subsequent quarter as a year progresses due to the overall growth of the business and operating costs to support that growth, including costs related to the opening of new retail stores and employee-related compensation to support growth. The fourth quarter, in particular, has historically experienced the highest amount of costs in a year to support the business demand in the quarter, even though a portion of the net revenue from that demand is not recognized until January of the following year, as discussed above. In 2022, this historical trend was offset by specific actions we took to reduce costs, including a reduction in marketing spend beginning in the second quarter and a reduction in corporate headcount in connection 
with our restructuring plan that was executed in the third quarter. These actions contributed to a sequential decline in selling, general, and administrative costs from quarter to quarter in 2022. In the future, seasonal trends may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results, which may impact the predictability of our business and operating results.
Impact Reporting
Since 2018, Warby Parker has published an annual Impact Report to evaluate and communicate the economic, environmental, and social impacts of our everyday business activities. Completing a yearly report, as benchmarked against the universally recognized GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) and SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, now under the oversight of the International Sustainability Board) frameworks, gives us the opportunity to examine how we’re aligning with our core values, assess if we’re growing responsibly, and to manage change more effectively. As a public benefit corporation, we are required to provide a biennial report on our impacts. We intend to use our 2022 Impact Report to serve as such statement.
Information in our Impact Reports does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report we file or furnish with the SEC.
Public Benefit Corporation Status
As a demonstration of our long-term commitment to promote vision and eye health and to work towards positively impacting the communities in which we operate, we elected in June 2021 to be treated as a public benefit corporation under Delaware law.
Under Delaware law, a public benefit corporation is required to identify in its certificate of incorporation the public benefit or benefits it will promote and its directors have a duty to manage the affairs of the corporation in a manner that balances the pecuniary interests of the corporation’s stockholders, the best interests of those materially affected by the corporation’s conduct, and the specific public benefit or public benefits identified in the public benefit corporation’s certificate of incorporation. Public benefit corporations organized in Delaware are also required to assess their benefit performance internally and to disclose to stockholders at least biennially a report detailing their success in meeting their benefit objectives.
As provided in our current certificate of incorporation, the public benefits that we promote, and pursuant to which we manage our company, are to provide access to products and services that promote vision and eye health and to work towards positively impacting the communities in which we operate.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is an important component of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws, as well as confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights.
As of December 31, 2022, we held 16 issued utility patents in the United States and 28 issued utility patents outside of the United States; four design patents in the United States and 62 issued design registrations outside of the United States; and 84 utility patent applications (including active PCT applications) pending in the United States and other countries, five design patent applications pending in the United States and two applications for design registrations pending in other countries. While we believe our patents and patent applications in the aggregate are important to our competitive position, no single patent or patent application is material to our business as a whole. 
We have trademark rights in our name and other brand indicia and have 41 trademark registrations and 10 active applications for select marks in the United States as well as 93 trademark registrations and active applications in 28 other jurisdictions around the world. As of December 31, 2022, we have also registered ten copyrights in the United States. We also register domain names for certain websites that we use in our business, such as www.warbyparker.com, as well as similar variations to protect our brands and marks from cybersquatters. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and registrability of new intellectual property and determine whether to seek patent protection or trademark or copyright registrations.
We seek to control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners. It is our practice to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements (or similar agreements) with our employees, consultants, and contractors involved in the development of intellectual property on our behalf. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with other third parties in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary information. We further control the use of our proprietary technology 
and intellectual property through provisions in our terms of service. We also monitor the activities of third parties with respect to potential infringing uses of our intellectual property.
From time to time, we have faced, and we expect to face in the future, allegations by third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities, that we have infringed their trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights, or challenging the validity or enforceability of our intellectual property rights. We are not presently a party to any such legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
See Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment—Failure to adequately maintain and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights could harm our brand, devalue our proprietary content, and adversely affect our ability to compete effectively.”
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 3,032 employees, including 1,860 full-time, 1,145 part-time, and 27 temporary employees, across 200 retail stores, two in-house optical laboratories, and two offices in the United States. We also engage contractors and consultants from time to time. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team. We are highly dependent on our management, highly skilled software engineers, Customer Experience and Retail teams, laboratory personnel, and other professionals, and it is crucial that we continue to attract, develop and retain valuable employees. To facilitate talent attraction, development and retention, we strive to make Warby Parker a diverse, inclusive, and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by what we believe are strong compensation and benefits programs. We believe that our employee relations are strong.
