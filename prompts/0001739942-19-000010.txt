ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
SolarWinds is a leading provider of information technology, or IT, infrastructure management software. Our products give organizations worldwide, regardless of type, size or IT infrastructure complexity, the power to monitor and manage the performance of their IT environments, whether on-premise, in the cloud, or in hybrid models. We combine powerful, scalable, affordable, easy to use products with a high-velocity, low-touch sales model to grow our business while also generating significant cash flow. 
Our business is focused on building products that enable technology professionals to manage “all things IT.” We continuously engage with technology professionals to understand the challenges they face maintaining high-performing and highly available on-premise, public and private cloud and hybrid IT infrastructures. The insights we gain from engaging with technology professionals allow us to build products that solve well-understood IT management challenges in ways that technology professionals want them solved. 
 Our approach, which we call the “SolarWinds Model,” enables us to market and sell our products directly to network and systems engineers, database administrators, storage administrators, DevOps professionals and managed service providers, or MSPs. These technology professionals have become empowered to influence the selection, and often the purchase, of products needed to rapidly solve the problems they confront.
We serve the entire IT market uniquely and efficiently with our SolarWinds Model. Technology professionals use our products in organizations ranging in size from very small businesses to large enterprises. Our products are designed to do the complex work of monitoring and managing networks, systems and applications across on-premise, cloud and hybrid IT environments without the need for customization or professional services. Many of our products are built on common technology platforms that enable our customers to easily purchase and deploy our products individually or as integrated suites as their needs evolve. We utilize a cost-efficient, integrated global product development model and have expanded our offerings over time through both organic development and strategic acquisitions. 
We market and sell our products directly to technology professionals with a high-velocity, low-touch, digital marketing and direct inside sales approach that we call “selling from the inside.” We have built a highly flexible and analytics-driven marketing model designed to efficiently drive website traffic and high-quality leads. We also engage using our online community, THWACK. This community is designed to train and inform technology professionals about our products, keep us connected to them and provide network effects to amplify word-of-mouth marketing for our products. Our sales team uses a prescriptive approach designed to manage these leads and quickly sell our products pursuant to our standard pricing and contract terms. We do not utilize an outside sales force or provide professional services.
Technology professionals often find our products when they are online searching for a solution to address a specific need and use our full-featured trials to experience our purpose-built, powerful and easy to use products in their own environments. These experiences often lead to initial purchases of one or more products and, over time, purchases of additional products and advocacy within both their organizations and their networks of technology professionals. 
We extend our sales reach through our MSP customers, who provide IT management as a service and rely on our products to manage and monitor the IT environments of their end customers. Our MSP customer base enables us to reach across a fragmented end market opportunity of millions of organizations and access a broader universe of customers. We benefit from the addition of end customers served by our MSP customers, the proliferation of devices managed by those MSPs and the expansion of products used by those MSPs to manage end customers’ IT infrastructures. 
We have grown while maintaining high levels of operating efficiency. We derive our revenue from a combination of subscription revenue from the sale of our cloud management and MSP products and license and maintenance revenue from the sale of our on-premise network and IT operations management perpetual license products. Over time, we have significantly increased our subscription and maintenance revenue and intend to grow our revenue and cash flow by gaining new customers, increasing penetration within our existing customer base, expanding our international footprint, bringing new products to market and expanding into new markets through organic development and targeted acquisitions.
SolarWinds Corporation was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 2015 under the name Project Aurora Parent, Inc. It changed its name to SolarWinds Parent, Inc. in May 2016, and in May 2018 changed its name to SolarWinds Corporation. 
Initial Public Offering
In October 2018, we completed our IPO, in which we sold and issued 25,000,000 shares of our common stock at an issue price of $15.00 per share. We raised a total of $375.0 million in gross proceeds from the offering, or approximately $353.0 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $17.8 million and offering-related expenses of 
3

approximately $4.2 million. A portion of the net proceeds from the offering were used to repay the $315.0 million in borrowings outstanding under our second lien term loan. In connection with the voluntary prepayment of the second lien term loan, we paid a $14.2 million prepayment fee. 
See Note 1. Organization and Nature of Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our IPO.
The SolarWinds Model
At SolarWinds, we do things differently. The focus and discipline that we bring to our business distinguish us in a highly competitive landscape.
We believe that growth and profitability are not conflicting priorities. We designed our business to allow us to grow and generate significant positive cash flow at the same time. 
At the heart of everything we do as a company is the SolarWinds Model, which consists of five principles that guide our business and help explain why technology professionals choose our products:
Focus on the Technology Professional
We are committed to understanding technology professionals and the daily challenges that they face managing the complex, ever-changing demands of business-critical IT environments. We have a substantial customer base and community of technology professionals. We engage with them on a daily basis through digital marketing and online communications. These include THWACK, our online community that provides forums to registered members, tools and valuable resources; several company-sponsored blogs in which we provide perspectives and information relevant to the IT management market; and web-based events designed to train and inform participants about deeper aspects of our products. We don’t have to guess about what they need, we just ask.
Build Great Products for the Entire Market
Organizations of all sizes have complex IT environments that make managing IT challenging. Our commitment to technology professionals allows us to deliver products that solve well-understood IT problems simply, quickly and affordably for the entire market, from very small businesses to the largest of global enterprises, regardless of whether their IT is managed internally or through an MSP.
We design our products to be easy to access, try, buy, deploy and use. Many of our products are built on common technology platforms that enable our customers to purchase and implement our products individually, and then add additional product or products as needed. Or they can buy multiple products as integrated suites. This allows customers to buy what they need, when they need it, and grow as their needs evolve.
Capture Demand Using Cost-Efficient, Mass-Reach Digital Marketing
We utilize digital marketing to directly reach technology professionals of all levels of sophistication managing IT environments of all levels of complexity and size. They are online every day interacting with their peers, learning about new technologies and searching for solutions to their problems.
Over the past decade, we have honed our use of online tools to find, communicate with and sell to our potential customers of all levels of sophistication with environments of all levels of complexity and size. We believe we build credibility and confidence in our products by being present and active in the communities and on the sites that technology professionals trust.
Sell from the Inside
We are committed to selling from the inside. We adhere to a prescriptive process and metrics-based approach that drives predictability and consistency and has helped us add new customers.
The size and organization of our sales force enables us to reach thousands of technology professionals each day. We close the smallest and most simple transactions to our largest and most complex deals efficiently without the need for an outside sales force, product customization or professional services. Our sales team uses a prescriptive approach designed to manage these leads and quickly sell our products pursuant to our standardized pricing and contract terms. We believe our selling motion reflects how our customers prefer to do business. 
Focus on the Long-Term Value of the Relationship with Our Customers
When our customers experience the value of our products, our investment in our product portfolio and our responsiveness to their changing needs, they often grow their relationship with us and become our advocates within both their organizations and their networks of technology professionals. The power of our approach is evidenced by the long-term relationships we have with our customers.

Growth Strategies
We intend to extend our leadership in network management and grow our market share in adjacent areas of IT management with powerful yet easy to use software products designed to manage “all things IT” across hybrid IT environments. The following are key elements of our growth strategy:
Win New Customers Using the SolarWinds Model
The SolarWinds Model allows us to win new customers in existing markets where our products and our model give us a competitive advantage. Our efficient marketing and sales model and powerful brand recognition and trust among technology professionals have enabled us to increase our customer base. We intend to leverage our ability to efficiently attract new customers to continue to increase our overall customer base.
Increase Penetration Within Our Existing Customer Base
Many of our customers make an initial purchase to meet an immediate need, such as network or application performance monitoring in a small portion of their IT infrastructure, and then subsequently purchase additional products for other use cases or expansion across their organization. Once our customers have used our products within their IT environment, we are well positioned to help identify additional products that offer further value to those customers. We continue to refine our sales effort to better target our marketing and sales efforts and expand the sales of our products within organizations, particularly those that have multiple purchasers of our IT management products.  
Increase Our International Footprint
We believe a substantial market opportunity exists to increase our international footprint across all of our product lines. In particular, our cloud management products, which are currently sold primarily in North America, have strong expansion potential. We have made significant investments in recent years to increase our sales and marketing operations internationally, and expect to continue to invest to grow our international sales and global brand awareness. 
Continue to Innovate
We intend to continue focusing on innovation and bringing new products and tools to market that address problems that technology professionals are asking us to solve. We also intend to continue providing frequent feature releases to our existing products. We are focused on enhancing the overall integration of our products to improve our value proposition and allow our customers to further benefit from expanding their usage of our products as their needs evolve.
Expand into New Markets Aligned with the SolarWinds Model
We have successfully entered new markets and expanded our product offerings to solve a broader set of challenges for customers. For example, in recent years we broadened our product offerings to address the database, storage, cloud and MSP markets. We intend to further expand into markets where our SolarWinds Model provides us with competitive advantages.
Pursue Targeted Acquisitions of Products and Technologies
We have successfully acquired and integrated businesses and technologies in the past that provided us with new product offerings and capabilities and helped us to establish positions in new segments and markets. We intend to continue making targeted acquisitions that complement and strengthen our product portfolio and capabilities or provide access to new markets. We evaluate acquisition opportunities to assess whether they will be successful within the SolarWinds Model. We believe our ability to effectively transition acquired companies and products to the SolarWinds Model represents a unique opportunity for our business.
Our Customers and Market
We designed the SolarWinds Model to reach all sizes of businesses. Our customers represent organizations ranging in size from very small businesses to large enterprises. Customers often initially purchase one of our products to solve a known problem and then expand their purchases over time. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had over 300,000 customers. We define customers as individuals or entities that have purchased one or more of our products under a unique customer identification number since our inception for our perpetual license products and individuals or entities that have an active subscription for at least one of our subscription products. Each unique customer identification number constitutes a separate customer regardless of the amount purchased. We may have multiple purchasers of our products within a single organization, each of which may be assigned a unique customer identification number and deemed a separate customer. 
The SolarWinds Model allows us to both sell to a broad group of potential customers and close large transactions with significant customers. At the same time, we designed the SolarWinds Model to reach businesses that outsource the management of some or 
5

all of their IT infrastructure to MSPs. We reach SMBs through MSPs and directly, including those SMBs that may purchase a single product to solve a known problem.
Organizations across industries are using technology and software to drive business success and competitive differentiation. As the landscape for IT infrastructure and software deployment worldwide rapidly changes to meet businesses’ evolving needs, the performance, speed, availability and security of IT has become critical to business strategy. The job of the technology professionals who deploy and manage these environments is more challenging than ever. 
Growing IT Complexity Creates Significant Challenges for Organizations
As organizations deploy and rely on a mix of on-premise, public and private cloud and hybrid IT environments, they require performance monitoring and management solutions that work across their increasingly complex environments and provide full visibility into performance. 
Empowerment of the Technology Professional
The technology professionals charged with managing these infrastructures are increasingly responsible for making technology choices to help ensure performance of IT infrastructure meets the needs of the business. Additionally, the democratization of IT spend has shifted influence in software purchase decisions from the highest levels of an organization’s IT department to technology professionals, who can have different perspectives from CIOs or other IT decision-makers. We have found that technology professionals prefer to trial software products in real time to determine if the products meet their needs. They also want the flexibility to select from a range of IT management products to find those best suited to address their specific challenges. In this environment, technology professionals are among the biggest influencers of software-purchasing decisions within their organizations.
Organizations Have Choices in Allocating Resources to Manage IT
Efficiently managing IT and quickly resolving problems are paramount for organizations of all sizes. However, as IT complexity grows, organizations must determine how to allocate their resources to best manage their IT needs. Organizations can choose to manage their own IT infrastructure or buy IT management as a service through MSPs. MSPs maintain and operate an organization’s IT environment and can deliver the full range of IT solutions, including network monitoring, server and desktop management, backup and recovery and IT security. For many smaller organizations that lack the time, resources and technical expertise to manage complex IT environments, MSPs can improve the efficacy of their IT strategy without significant capital investment. For larger organizations, MSPs can replace or supplement in-house capabilities. 
Limitations of Alternative Solutions
Alternative IT management solutions have limitations that impair their ability to efficiently serve the unique needs of technology professionals. These solutions can be expensive, complicated and inflexible and may require significant professional services to customize, implement, operate and maintain.
Given the challenges associated with operating across a complex range of dynamic, hybrid IT environments and the limited ability of existing solutions to address these challenges in the ways that technology professionals want them addressed, we believe there is a significant market opportunity for broad hybrid IT management solutions purpose-built to serve the needs of technology professionals. 
Product Portfolio and Technology Platforms
We offer over 50 products to monitor and manage network, systems, desktop, application, storage, database and website infrastructures, whether on-premise, in the public or private cloud or in a hybrid IT infrastructure. We intend to continue to innovate and invest in areas of product development that bring new products to market and enhance the functionality, ease of use and integration of our current products. We believe this will strengthen the overall value proposition of our products in any IT environment. 
Our product development is guided by principles that provide a development framework that allows us to respond quickly to the market and deliver a broad suite of products designed to solve problems that are commonly understood and shared by our customers. Our core product development principles are:

1. | We purpose-build products for technology professionals.


2. | Our roadmaps are guided by a large community of users rather than by a select few large customers.


3. | We develop products that are intended to sell themselves and be easy to use, powerful and immediately valuable to users.


4. | We design and develop our products to integrate and complement each other while providing a consistent user experience.

We believe we have one of the broadest product portfolios of IT monitoring and management software across the industry, providing deep visibility into web, application, database, virtual resources, storage, and network performance. Our products monitor 
6

applications and their supporting infrastructure, whether the applications are located on-premise, in the cloud, or in a hybrid environment. Our products monitor applications in the cloud via an agent, agentlessly, or by using information from cloud providers’ APIs.
Our approach to IT management allows us to cross-pollinate products across markets and environments. Most recently, we integrated NetPath, a product that is part of our core IT portfolio and provides deep visibility into critical network paths, into our core MSP offering. 
Core IT Products
Targeted for IT professionals, our core IT products provide hybrid IT performance management with deep visibility into application and IT infrastructure across both on-premise and cloud infrastructures. Our suite of network management software provides real-time visibility into network utilization and bandwidth as well as the ability to quickly detect, diagnose and resolve network performance problems. Our suite of system management products monitors and analyzes the performance of applications and their supporting infrastructure, including websites, servers, physical, virtual and cloud infrastructure, storage and databases. We also help our customers strengthen their security and compliance posture with our automated network configuration, backup and log and event management products.
Our core IT offerings, enabled by our common technology platform, are highly scalable and can be added alongside existing products in a modular fashion. Integrating our network products and IT operations management products, which we previously referred to as systems management products, our platform combines data from multiple parts of the IT stack to provide a single, unified application-centric view and customer experience. Our platform also enables a single dashboard to view real-time application metrics regardless of whether the applications are deployed across multiple data centers or cloud vendors globally.
Our core IT products include both core licensed products and tools. Our core licensed products are typically server-based with a browser interface, have a higher average selling price than tools and are the focus of our strategies to drive revenue growth. Our tools can be server-or laptop-based, typically have a lower average selling price than our core licensed products and are primarily used by us to meet a critical need of our target customer base, but are not the focus of our revenue growth strategies.

Cloud Management Products
Targeted for DevOps and ITOps professionals, our cloud management products provide cloud-based monitoring of the full IT stack whether deployed in the cloud or on-premise. Our cloud management products enable visibility into log data, cloud infrastructure metrics, applications, tracing and web performance management. In addition to our individual products that address each of these areas, we also offer AppOptics, which integrates application performance, server infrastructure monitoring and custom metrics into one unified, cloud-based solution.
MSP Products
Our portfolio targeted for MSPs delivers broad, scalable IT service management solutions to enable MSPs to deliver outsourced IT services for their SMB end-customers and more efficiently manage their own businesses. Our core remote monitoring and management software, which remotely monitors desktops, laptops, servers and mobile devices across operating systems and platforms, integrates with a broad offering of MSP-focused products on a common platform including patch management, backup, anti-virus, web protection, risk assessment, help desk/service ticketing and application management. We also offer an email protection and archiving platform on a standalone basis that protects businesses from phishing, malware and other email-borne threats.
Marketing and Sales
We market and sell our products directly to technology professionals with a low-touch, high-velocity digital marketing and “selling from the inside” motion that we believe is unique and hard to replicate in the software industry. Our marketing and sales process allows us to effectively capture demand and maintain high levels of sales productivity at low customer acquisition costs. 
We target our marketing efforts and selling motion directly at network, systems, DevOps and MSP professionals within organizations versus the organizations themselves. We believe this approach provides us with a significant advantage in today’s environment in which purchasing influence and power is shifting from traditional procurement to the technology professionals themselves.
Marketing
We have built a highly flexible and analytics-driven direct marketing model designed to efficiently drive website traffic and high-quality leads that are typically trials of full-featured products from our websites. By providing trials of full-featured products we enable prospective customers to easily explore the capabilities of our products and easily transition from trial to sale. We also have a marketing motion directed at current customers designed to educate them about features of products they own, products they do not own and how to trial new products.
We make broad use of digital marketing tools including search engines, targeted email campaigns, localized websites, free IT management tools, display advertising, affiliate marketing, social media, e-book distribution, video content, blogging and webinars.
We also engage using our online community, THWACK. Within THWACK, we provide forums, solutions, tools, webinars, content and other valuable resources relevant to the IT management market. This community is designed to train and inform technology professionals about our products, keep us connected to them and provide network effects to amplify word-of-mouth marketing for our products. 
Sales
We refer to our selling motion as “selling from the inside.” This approach is rooted in having our sales organization physically located in our offices, selling exclusively online or over the phone, using a prescriptive approach to managing leads and adhering to standardized pricing and contract terms. We close transactions of all sizes and locations through our selling from the inside approach. We do not employ any outside sales personnel.
Our sales organization is divided into our dedicated sales team and our retention and maintenance renewal team. Our dedicated sales team focuses exclusively on sales of new products to new and existing customers. Our dedicated sales team receives high-quality leads from our marketing motion and engages with the prospect to close the sale. We adhere to a disciplined, data-driven approach to converting leads quickly and efficiently based on our understanding of the prospect’s specific product demands and the inflection points in the selling process.
Our retention and maintenance renewal team focuses exclusively on renewing our subscription and maintenance agreements with our customers. Our conversations with these customers begin months before the renewal date to support our customers, and we work with them through the renewal process.
We also sell our software through distributors and resellers to supplement our direct sales force, expand our global presence, reach various market segments and help us to initiate and fulfill sales orders from state, local and federal governments and those commercial customers that prefer to make purchases through a particular reseller. We contract directly with end customers when 
8

we sell our products through channel partners. We have a number of resellers who are proactively creating demand for our products and bring new opportunities and customers to us. In addition to selling to SMBs directly, we also deliver our technology to SMBs through our MSP customers, who use our products to provide outsourced IT management services to these SMBs.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is primarily responsible for the design, development, testing and deployment of new products and improvements to existing products, with a focus on ensuring that our products integrate and complement one another.
We have designed our software development process to be responsive to customer needs, cost efficient and agile. In our process, we work closely with our user community throughout the development process, to build what is needed for the problems technology professionals face every day. This includes regularly having a subset of our customers participate in validating that our product use cases and features will solve their problems.
Over more than a decade, we have honed our approach to building a development organization that allows us to build products and enhance existing products quickly, efficiently, and cost-effectively. Our low-cost global development model allows us to source from a large pool of talented resources by participating in multiple labor markets to match the best person to each role, at the most efficient cost. We utilize small scrum teams, each dedicated to specific product modules that follow a standard set of practices to build and test their code continuously. We share our development values across our offices and aim to assign meaningful design and development work to our international locations.
We believe that we have developed a differentiated process that allows us to release new software rapidly, cost effectively and with a high level of quality.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry that is characterized by constant change and innovation. Changes in networks, applications, devices, operating systems and deployment environments result in evolving customer requirements. Our competitors and potential competitors include:

• | large network management and IT vendors such as Netscout, MicroFocus, CA Technologies, IBM and BMC Software; and


• | smaller companies in the cloud and application monitoring and the MSP IT tools markets, where we do not believe that a single or small group of companies has achieved market leadership.

We believe the principal competitive factors in our market are:

• | brand awareness and reputation among technology professionals, including IT professionals, DevOps professionals and MSPs;


• | product capabilities, including scalability, performance and reliability;


• | ability to solve problems for companies of all sizes and infrastructure complexities;


• | ease of use;


• | total cost of ownership;


• | flexible deployment models, including on-premise, in the cloud or in a hybrid environment;


• | strength of sales and marketing efforts; and


• | focus on customer success.

We believe that we compete effectively across these factors as our products and marketing efforts have been designed with these criteria as guideposts.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade dress and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection. As of December 31, 2018, we owned approximately 30 issued U.S. patents and 160 issued foreign patents, with expiration dates ranging from October 2026 to November 2036. We have also filed approximately 65 currently pending patent applications, but we cannot guarantee that patents will be issued with respect to our current patent applications in a manner that gives us the protection that we seek or at all. Our patents and any future patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or 
9

circumvented and may not provide sufficiently broad protection or may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers.
We endeavor to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and with parties with which we do business in order to limit access to and disclosure of, and safeguard our ownership of, our proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use or reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive with ours or that infringe our intellectual property, and policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights can be difficult. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on any legal actions against these infringers being successful, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.
Furthermore, effective patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available or where we have operations. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and still evolving.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 2,738 employees, of which 1,030 were employed in the United States and 1,708 were employed outside of the United States. We consider our current relationship with our employees to be good. We are not party to any collective bargaining agreement.
