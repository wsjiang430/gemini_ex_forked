Introduction 
 Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment banking, securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals. 
 When we use the terms Goldman Sachs, the firm, we, us and our, we mean The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc. or parent company), a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 References to this Form 10-K are to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. All references to 2018, 2017 and 2016 refer to our years ended, or the dates, as the context requires, December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. 
 Group Inc. is a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company (FHC) regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). Our U.S. depository institution subsidiary, Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA), is a New York State-chartered bank. 
 As of December 2018, we had offices in over 30 countries and 46% of our headcount was based outside the Americas. Our clients are located worldwide and we are an active participant in financial markets around the world. 
 Our Business Segments 
 We report our activities in four business segments: Investment Banking, Institutional Client Services, Investing & Lending and Investment Management. 

 The chart below presents our four business segments. 
 

Investment Banking 
 Investment Banking serves public and private sector clients around the world. We provide financial advisory services and help companies raise capital to strengthen and grow their businesses. We seek to develop and maintain long-term relationships with a diverse global group of institutional clients, including corporates, governments, states and municipalities. Our goal is to deliver to our institutional clients the entire resources of the firm in a seamless fashion, with investment banking serving as the main initial point of contact with Goldman Sachs. 
 Financial Advisory. We are a leader in providing financial advisory services, including strategic advisory assignments with respect to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense activities, restructurings, spin-offs and risk management. In particular, we help clients execute large, complex transactions for which we provide multiple services, including cross-border structuring expertise. Financial Advisory also includes revenues from derivative transactions directly related to these client advisory assignments. We also assist our clients in managing their asset and liability exposures and their capital.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 
 Underwriting. The other core activity of Investment Banking is helping companies raise capital to fund their businesses. As a financial intermediary, our job is to match the capital of our investing clients, who aim to grow the savings of millions of people, with the needs of our public and private sector clients, who need financing to generate growth, create jobs and deliver products and services. Our underwriting activities include public offerings and private placements, including local and cross-border transactions and acquisition financing, of a wide range of securities and other financial instruments, including loans. Underwriting also includes revenues from derivative transactions entered into with public and private sector clients in connection with our underwriting activities. 
 Equity Underwriting. We underwrite common and preferred stock and convertible and exchangeable securities. We regularly receive mandates for large, complex transactions and have held a leading position in worldwide public common stock offerings and worldwide initial public offerings for many years. 
 Debt Underwriting. We underwrite and originate various types of debt instruments, including investment-grade and high-yield debt, bank loans and bridge loans, including in connection with acquisition financing, and emerging- and growth-market debt, which may be issued by, among others, corporate, sovereign, municipal and agency issuers. In addition, we underwrite and originate structured securities, which include mortgage-related securities and other asset-backed securities. 
Institutional Client Services 
 Institutional Client Services serves our clients who come to us to buy and sell financial products, raise funding and manage risk. We do this by acting as a market maker and offering market expertise on a global basis. Institutional Client Services makes markets and facilitates client transactions in fixed income, equity, currency and commodity products. In addition, we make markets in and clear client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide. 
 As a market maker, we provide prices to clients globally across thousands of products in all major asset classes and markets. At times we take the other side of transactions ourselves if a buyer or seller is not readily available and at other times we connect our clients to other parties who want to transact. Our willingness to make markets, commit capital and take risk in a broad range of products is crucial to our client relationships. Market makers provide liquidity and play a critical role in price discovery, which contributes to the overall efficiency of the capital markets. 

 Our clients are primarily institutions that are professional market participants, including investment entities whose ultimate clients include individual investors investing for their retirement, buying insurance or putting aside surplus cash in a deposit account. 
 Through our global sales force, we maintain relationships with our clients, receiving orders and distributing investment research, trading ideas, market information and analysis. Much of this connectivity between us and our clients is maintained on technology platforms and operates globally wherever and whenever markets are open for trading. 
 Institutional Client Services and our other businesses are supported by our Global Investment Research division, which, as of December 2018, provided fundamental research on approximately 3,000 companies worldwide and more than 40 national economies, as well as on industries, currencies and commodities. 
 Institutional Client Services generates revenues from the following activities: 
 

 | In large, highly liquid markets (such as markets for U.S. Treasury bills, large capitalization S&P 500 Index stocks or certain mortgage pass-through securities), we execute a high volume of transactions for our clients;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In less liquid markets (such as mid-cap corporate bonds, growth market currencies or certain non-agency mortgage-backed securities), we execute transactions for our clients for spreads and fees that are generally somewhat larger than those charged in more liquid markets;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We also structure and execute transactions involving customized or tailor-made products that address our clients risk exposures, investment objectives or other complex needs (such as a jet fuel hedge for an airline);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We provide financing to our clients for their securities trading activities, as well as securities lending and other prime brokerage services; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In connection with our market-making activities, we maintain inventory, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand. We also hold inventory to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities. We carry our inventory at fair value with changes in valuation reflected in net revenues.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 
 Institutional Client Services activities are organized by asset class and include both cash and derivative instruments. Cash refers to trading the underlying instrument (such as a stock, bond or barrel of oil). Derivative refers to instruments that derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates and other inputs, or a combination of these factors (such as an option, which is the right or obligation to buy or sell a certain bond, stock or other asset on a specified date in the future at a certain price, or an interest rate swap, which is the agreement to convert a fixed rate of interest into a floating rate or vice versa). 
 Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution. Includes client execution activities related to making markets in both cash and derivative instruments for interest rate products, credit products, mortgages, currencies and commodities. 

 | Interest Rate Products. Government bonds (including inflation-linked securities) across maturities, other government-backed securities, securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements), and interest rate swaps, options and other derivatives.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Credit Products. Investment-grade corporate securities, high-yield securities, credit derivatives, exchange-traded funds, bank and bridge loans, municipal securities, emerging market and distressed debt, and trade claims.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Mortgages. Commercial mortgage-related securities, loans and derivatives, residential mortgage-related securities, loans and derivatives (including U.S. government agency-issued collateralized mortgage obligations and other securities and loans), and other asset-backed securities, loans and derivatives.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Currencies. Currency options, spot/forwards and other derivatives on G-10 currencies and emerging-market products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Commodities. Commodity derivatives and, to a lesser extent, physical commodities, involving crude oil and petroleum products, natural gas, base, precious and other metals, electricity, coal, agricultural and other commodity products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Equities. Includes equities client execution, commissions and fees, and securities services. 

 Equities Client Execution. We make markets in equity securities and equity-related products, including exchange-traded funds, convertible securities, options, futures and over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments, on a global basis. As a principal, we facilitate client transactions by providing liquidity to our clients, including with large blocks of stocks or derivatives, requiring the commitment of our capital. 
 We also structure and make markets in derivatives on indices, industry groups, financial measures and individual company stocks. We develop strategies and provide information about portfolio hedging and restructuring and asset allocation transactions for our clients. We also work with our clients to create specially tailored instruments to enable sophisticated investors to establish or liquidate investment positions or undertake hedging strategies. We are one of the leading participants in the trading and development of equity derivative instruments. 
 Our exchange-based market-making activities include making markets in stocks and exchange-traded funds, futures and options on major exchanges worldwide. 
 Commissions and Fees. We generate commissions and fees from executing and clearing institutional client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide, as well as OTC transactions. We provide our clients with access to a broad spectrum of equity execution services, including electronic low-touch access and more complex high-touch execution through both traditional and electronic platforms. 
 Securities Services. Includes financing, securities lending and other prime brokerage services. 
 

 | Financing Services. We provide financing to our clients for their securities trading activities through margin loans that are collateralized by securities, cash or other acceptable collateral. We earn a spread equal to the difference between the amount we pay for funds and the amount we receive from our client.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Securities Lending Services. We provide services that principally involve borrowing and lending securities to cover institutional clients short sales and borrowing securities to cover our short sales and otherwise to make deliveries into the market. In addition, we are an active participant in broker-to-broker securities lending and third-party agency lending activities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Other Prime Brokerage Services. We earn fees by providing clearing, settlement and custody services globally. In addition, we provide our hedge fund and other clients with a technology platform and reporting which enables them to monitor their security portfolios and manage risk exposures.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Investing & Lending 
 Our investing and lending activities, which are typically longer-term, include activities across various asset classes, primarily debt securities and loans, public and private equity securities, infrastructure and real estate. These activities include making investments, some of which are consolidated, through our Merchant Banking business and our Special Situations Group. Some of these investments are made indirectly through funds that we manage. We also provide financing to corporate clients and individuals, including bank loans, personal loans and mortgages. 
 Equity Securities. We make corporate, real estate, infrastructure and other equity-related investments. 
 Debt Securities and Loans. We make corporate, real estate, infrastructure and other debt investments. In addition, we provide financing to clients through loan facilities and through secured loans, including secured loans through our digital platform, Goldman Sachs Private Bank Select. We also make unsecured loans and accept deposits through our digital platform, Marcus: by Goldman Sachs. 
 Investment Management 
 Investment Management provides investment and wealth advisory services to help clients preserve and grow their financial assets. We provide these services to our institutional and high-net-worth individual clients, as well as investors who primarily access our products through a network of third-party distributors around the world. 
 We manage client assets across a broad range of investment strategies and asset classes, including equity, fixed income and alternative investments. Alternative investments primarily includes hedge funds, credit funds, private equity, real estate, currencies, commodities and asset allocation strategies. Our investment offerings include those managed on a fiduciary basis by our portfolio managers, as well as strategies managed by third-party managers. We offer our investments in a variety of structures, including separately managed accounts, mutual funds, private partnerships and other commingled vehicles. 
 We also provide customized investment advisory solutions designed to address our clients investment needs. These solutions begin with identifying clients objectives and continue through portfolio construction, ongoing asset allocation and risk management and investment realization. We draw from a variety of third-party managers, as well as our proprietary offerings to implement solutions for clients. 

 We supplement our investment advisory solutions for high-net-worth individuals with wealth advisory services that include income and liability management, trust and estate planning, philanthropic giving and tax planning. We also use our global securities and derivatives market-making capabilities to address clients specific investment needs. 
 Management and Other Fees. The majority of revenues in management and other fees consists of asset-based fees on client assets. The fees that we charge vary by asset class, distribution channel and the type of services provided, and are affected by investment performance, as well as asset inflows and redemptions. Other fees we receive primarily include financial planning and counseling fees generated through wealth advisory services provided by our subsidiary, The Ayco Company, L.P. 
 Assets under supervision include client assets where we earn a fee for managing assets on a discretionary basis. This includes net assets in our mutual funds, hedge funds, credit funds and private equity funds (including real estate funds), and separately managed accounts for institutional and individual investors. Assets under supervision also include client assets invested with third-party managers, bank deposits and advisory relationships where we earn a fee for advisory and other services, but do not have investment discretion. Assets under supervision do not include the self-directed brokerage assets of our clients. Long-term assets under supervision represent assets under supervision excluding liquidity products. Liquidity products represent money market and bank deposit assets. 
 Incentive Fees. In certain circumstances, we are also entitled to receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a funds or a separately managed accounts return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets. Such fees include overrides, which consist of the increased share of the income and gains derived primarily from our private equity and credit funds when the return on a funds investments over the life of the fund exceeds certain threshold returns. 
 Transaction Revenues. We receive commissions and net spreads for facilitating transactional activity in high-net-worth individual accounts. In addition, we earn net interest income primarily associated with client deposits and margin lending activity undertaken by such clients.

 Business Continuity and Information Security 
 Business continuity and information security, including cyber security, are high priorities for Goldman Sachs. Their importance has been highlighted by numerous highly publicized events in recent years, including (i) cyber attacks against financial institutions, governmental agencies, large consumer-based companies and other organizations that resulted in the unauthorized disclosure of personal information of clients and customers and other sensitive or confidential information, the theft and destruction of corporate information and requests for ransom payments, and (ii) extreme weather events. 
 Our Business Continuity & Technology Resilience Program has been developed to provide reasonable assurance of business continuity in the event of disruptions at our critical facilities or systems and to comply with regulatory requirements, including those of FINRA. Because we are a BHC, our Business Continuity & Technology Resilience Program is also subject to review by the FRB. The key elements of the program are crisis management, business continuity, technology resilience, business recovery, assurance and verification, and process improvement. In the area of information security, we have developed and implemented a framework of principles, policies and technology designed to protect the information provided to us by our clients and our own information from cyber attacks and other misappropriation, corruption or loss. Safeguards are designed to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. 
 Employees 
 Management believes that a major strength and principal reason for the success of Goldman Sachs is the quality and dedication of our people and the shared sense of being part of a team. We strive to maintain a work environment that fosters professionalism, excellence, diversity, cooperation among our employees worldwide and high standards of business ethics. 
 Instilling the Goldman Sachs culture in all employees is a continuous process, in which training plays an important part. All employees are offered the opportunity to participate in education and periodic seminars that we sponsor at various locations throughout the world. Another important part of instilling the Goldman Sachs culture is our employee review process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, co-workers and employees they supervise in a 360-degree review process that is integral to our team approach, and which includes an evaluation of an employees performance with respect to risk management, compliance and diversity. As of December 2018, we had headcount of 36,600. 

Competition 
 The financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. Our competitors are other entities that provide investment banking, market-making and investment management services, and commercial and/or consumer lending and deposit-taking products, as well as those entities that make investments in securities, commodities, derivatives, real estate, loans and other financial assets. These entities include brokers and dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, insurance companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, merchant banks, consumer finance companies and financial technology and other internet-based companies. We compete with some entities globally and with others on a regional, product or niche basis. We compete based on a number of factors, including transaction execution, products and services, innovation, reputation and price. 
 We have faced, and expect to continue to face, pressure to retain market share by committing capital to businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may not be commensurate with their risks. In particular, corporate clients seek such commitments (such as agreements to participate in their loan facilities) from financial services firms in connection with investment banking and other assignments. 
 Consolidation and convergence have significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors, and have also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. To take advantage of some of our most significant opportunities, we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions that are larger and have more capital and that may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the U.S. 
 We also compete with smaller institutions that offer more targeted services, such as independent advisory firms. Some clients may perceive these firms to be less susceptible to potential conflicts of interest than we are, and, as described below, our ability to effectively compete with them could be affected by regulations and limitations on activities that apply to us but may not apply to them. 




Goldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K | 5

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 
 A number of our businesses are subject to intense price competition. Efforts by our competitors to gain market share have resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking and market-making businesses, and could result in pricing pressure in other of our businesses. For example, the increasing volume of trades executed electronically, through the internet and through alternative trading systems, has increased the pressure on trading commissions, in that commissions for electronic trading are generally lower than for non-electronic trading. It appears that this trend toward low-commission trading will continue. Price competition has also led to compression in the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it (i.e., bid/offer spread), which has affected our market-making businesses. In addition, we believe that we will continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by further reducing prices, and as we enter into or expand our presence in markets that may rely more heavily on electronic trading and execution. 
 We also compete on the basis of the types of financial products that we and our competitors offer. In some circumstances, our competitors may offer financial products that we do not offer and that our clients may prefer. 
 The provisions of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the requirements promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and other financial regulation could affect our competitive position to the extent that limitations on activities, increased fees and compliance costs or other regulatory requirements do not apply, or do not apply equally, to all of our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across different jurisdictions. For example, the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibit proprietary trading and restrict investments in certain hedge and private equity funds differentiate between U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based banking organizations and give non-U.S.-based banking organizations greater flexibility to trade outside of the U.S. and to form and invest in funds outside the U.S. 
 Likewise, the obligations with respect to derivative transactions under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act depend, in part, on the location of the counterparties to the transaction. The impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulatory developments on our competitive position will depend to a large extent on the manner in which the required rulemaking and regulatory guidance evolve, the extent of international convergence, and the development of market practice and structures under the new regulatory regimes as described further in Regulation below. 

 We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees and to continue to compensate employees competitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation practices of large financial institutions. Our pay practices and those of certain of our competitors are subject to review by, and the standards of, the FRB and other regulators inside and outside the U.S., including the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the U.K. We also compete for employees with institutions whose pay practices are not subject to regulatory oversight. See Regulation  Compensation Practices and Risk Factors  Our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further information about such regulation. 
 Regulation 
 As a participant in the global financial services industry, we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision worldwide. The Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules thereunder, significantly altered the U.S. financial regulatory regime within which we operate and the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation and Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (collectively, MiFID II) have significantly revised the regulatory regime for our European operations. The Basel Committees framework for strengthening the regulation, supervision and risk management of banks (Basel III), is implemented by the FRB, the PRA and other national regulators. The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for prudential bank regulation. However, its standards are not effective in any jurisdiction until rules implementing such standards have been implemented by the relevant regulators. The implications of such regulations for our businesses depend to a large extent on their implementation by the relevant regulators globally, and the market practices and structures that develop. 
 In 2017 and 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, in response to an executive order issued by the President of the U.S., issued four reports recommending a number of comprehensive changes to the regulatory systems applicable in the U.S. to banks and other financial institutions. 
 Other reforms have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide, as described below. Recent developments have added additional uncertainty to the implementation, scope and timing of regulatory reforms and potential for deregulation in some areas. The effects of any changes to the regulations affecting our businesses, including as a result of the proposals described below, are uncertain and will not be known until the changes are finalized and market practices and structures develop under the revised regulations.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 
 Goldman Sachs International (GSI), Goldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB) and Goldman Sachs Asset Management International (GSAMI), our principal E.U. operating subsidiaries, are incorporated and headquartered in the U.K. and, as such, are currently subject to E.U. legal and regulatory requirements, based on directly binding regulations of the E.U. and the implementation of E.U. directives by the U.K. They all currently benefit from non-discriminatory access to E.U. clients and infrastructure based on E.U. treaties and E.U. legislation, including cross-border passporting arrangements and specific arrangements for the establishment of E.U. branches. As a result of the U.K.s notification to the European Council of its decision to leave the E.U. (Brexit), there is considerable uncertainty as to the regulatory regime that will be applicable in the U.K. and the regulatory framework that will govern transactions and business undertaken by our U.K. subsidiaries in the remaining E.U. countries. The U.K.s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 aims to preserve the direct and operative E.U. law governing the requirements on U.K. financial service providers as English law beginning March 29, 2019. References to E.U. regulations that are in effect in the U.K. as of March 29, 2019 may apply to our U.K. subsidiaries following Brexit. In addition, proposals by the Basel Committee or the E.U. may be implemented in the U.K. and apply to our U.K. subsidiaries. 
 Pursuant to an agreement endorsed by the E.U. and U.K. leaders in November (Withdrawal Agreement), the existing access arrangements for financial services would continue unchanged until the end of 2020, with potential for one further extension of up to two years, subsequent to which a new trade relationship may be established between the E.U. and the U.K. While the parties have issued a political declaration on the outline of such co-operation, the exact terms of that future relationship, including the exact terms of access to each others financial markets remain subject to future negotiation. If the Withdrawal Agreement is not ratified, beginning March 29, 2019, the date on which the U.K. is scheduled to leave the E.U., firms established in the U.K., including our U.K. subsidiaries, would lose their pan-E.U. passports and generally be treated like entities in countries outside the E.U. They may, however, benefit from emergency measures, including those that several E.U. member states have introduced so that existing contractual arrangements are not disrupted, in order to minimize any impact on existing transactions. The E.U. has also provided interim recognition to U.K. clearing houses so that E.U. clients can continue to access them. 

Banking Supervision and Regulation 
 Group Inc. is a BHC under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act) and an FHC under amendments to the BHC Act effected by the U.S. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLB Act), and is subject to supervision and examination by the FRB, which is our primary regulator. 
 Under the system of functional regulation established under the BHC Act, the primary regulators of our U.S. non-bank subsidiaries directly regulate the activities of those subsidiaries, with the FRB exercising a supervisory role. Such functionally regulated subsidiaries include broker-dealers registered with the SEC, such as our principal U.S. broker-dealer, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (GS&Co.), entities registered with or regulated by the CFTC with respect to futures-related and swaps-related activities and investment advisers registered with the SEC with respect to their investment advisory activities. 
 In November 2018, the FRB issued a final rule establishing a new rating system for large financial institutions, such as us. The new rating system is intended to align with the FRBs existing supervisory program for large financial institutions and includes component ratings for capital planning, liquidity risk management, and governance and controls. The FRB has also proposed related guidance for the governance and controls component. 
 Our principal U.S. bank subsidiary, GS Bank USA, is supervised and regulated by the FRB, the FDIC, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. A number of our activities are conducted partially or entirely through GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries, including: origination of bank loans; personal loans and mortgages; interest rate, credit, currency and other derivatives; leveraged finance; deposit-taking; and agency lending. Our consumer-oriented activities are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by federal and state regulators with regard to consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and other practices in connection with marketing and providing consumer financial products. 




Goldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K | 7

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 
 Certain of our subsidiaries are regulated by the banking and securities regulatory authorities of the countries in which they operate. As described below, our E.U. subsidiaries, including our U.K. subsidiaries, are subject to various European regulations, as well as national laws, which to some extent implement European directives. 
 GSI, our U.K. broker-dealer subsidiary and a designated investment firm, and GSIB, our U.K. bank subsidiary, are regulated by the PRA and the FCA. GSI provides broker-dealer services in and from the U.K., and GSIB acts as a primary dealer for European government bonds and is involved in market making in European government bonds, lending (including securities lending) and deposit-taking activities. GSIBs consumer-oriented deposit-taking activities are subject to U.K. consumer protection regulations. Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE, formerly Goldman Sachs AG), our German bank subsidiary, is regulated by the BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank within the context of the European Single Supervisory Mechanism. In addition, in December 2018, our German subsidiary, Goldman Sachs Europe SE, was approved by BaFin as an authorized investment firm, which will allow it to conduct certain activities (such as activities related to physical commodities) which GSBE may be prevented from undertaking. 
 Capital and Liquidity Requirements. We and GS Bank USA are subject to regulatory risk-based capital and leverage requirements that are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). The Capital Framework is largely based on Basel III and also implements certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the Capital Framework, we and GS Bank USA are Advanced approach banking organizations. We have also been designated as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB). Under the FRBs capital adequacy requirements, we and GS Bank USA must meet specific regulatory capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items. The sufficiency of our capital levels is also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. We and GS Bank USA are also subject to liquidity requirements established by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. 

 In October 2018, the FRB released two proposals that would generally make the applicable capital and liquidity requirements less stringent for large U.S. banking organizations other than those that are U.S. G-SIBs, such as us. 
 GSI and GSIB are subject to capital requirements prescribed in the E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the E.U. Fourth Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV). GSI and GSIB are subject to liquidity requirements established by U.K. regulatory authorities that are similar to those applicable to GS Bank USA and us. 
 Risk-Based Capital Ratios. The Capital Framework provides for an additional capital ratio requirement that consists of three components: (i) for capital conservation (capital conservation buffer), (ii) for countercyclicality (countercyclical capital buffer) and (iii) as a consequence of our designation as a G-SIB (G-SIB buffer). The additional capital ratio requirement must be satisfied entirely with capital that qualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1). GS Bank USA is subject to the first two components of the additional capital ratio requirement discussed above. 
 The capital conservation buffer and G-SIB buffer began to phase in on January 1, 2016 and continued to do so through January 1, 2019. In April 2018, the FRB proposed a rule that would, among other things, replace the capital conservation buffer with a stress capital buffer (SCB) requirement for large BHCs subject to the FRBs Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). See Regulation  Banking Supervision and Regulation  Stress Tests for further information about this proposed rule. 
 The countercyclical capital buffer is designed to counteract systemic vulnerabilities and currently applies only to Advanced approach banking organizations. Several other national supervisors also require countercyclical capital buffers. The G-SIB and countercyclical capital buffers applicable to us could change in the future and, as a result, the minimum capital ratios to which we are subject could change. 
 In December 2018, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that would provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one regulatory capital effects of the adoption of the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) accounting standard. The FRB also released a statement indicating that it will not incorporate CECL into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses in supervisory stress tests through the 2021 stress test cycle. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information about CECL.

 In October 2018, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a proposed rule that would implement the Basel Committees standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures in connection with derivative contracts (SA-CCR). Under the proposal, Advanced approach banking organizations would be required to use SA-CCR for purposes of calculating their standardized risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and, with some adjustments, for purposes of determining their supplementary leverage ratios (SLRs) discussed below. 
 The Basel Committee has published final guidelines for calculating incremental capital ratio requirements for banking institutions that are systemically significant from a domestic but not global perspective (D-SIBs). If these guidelines are implemented by national regulators, they will apply, among others, to certain subsidiaries of G-SIBs. These guidelines are in addition to the framework for G-SIBs, but are more principles-based. CRD IV and the CRR provide that institutions that are systemically important at the E.U. or member state level, known as other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs), may be subject to additional capital ratio requirements of up to 2% of CET1, according to their degree of systemic importance (O-SII buffers). O-SIIs are identified annually, along with their applicable buffers. The PRA has identified Goldman Sachs Group UK Limited (GSG UK), the parent company of GSI and GSIB, as an O-SII. GSG UKs O-SII buffer is currently set at zero percent. 
 In January 2019, the Basel Committee finalized revisions to the framework for calculating capital requirements for market risk, which is expected to increase market risk capital requirements for most banking organizations, although to a lesser degree than the version of the framework issued in January 2016. The revised framework, among other things, revises the standardized approach and internal models to calculate market risk requirements and clarifies the scope of positions subject to market risk capital requirements. The Basel Committee has proposed that national regulators implement the revised framework beginning January 1, 2022. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies and the European Commission have not yet proposed rules implementing the 2019 version of the revised market risk framework for the U.S. and E.U. financial institutions, respectively. 

 In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms. These standards set a floor on internally modeled capital requirements at a percentage of the capital requirements under the standardized approach. They also revise the Basel Committees standardized and model-based approaches for credit risk, provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital and revise the frameworks for credit valuation adjustment risk. The Basel Committee has proposed that national regulators implement these standards beginning January 1, 2022, and that the new floor be phased in through January 1, 2027. 
 The Basel Committee has also published updated frameworks relating to Pillar 3 disclosure requirements and the regulatory capital treatment of securitization exposures and a revised G-SIB assessment methodology. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing the December 2017 standards for purposes of risk-based capital ratios or the Basel Committee frameworks. 
 See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information about the capital ratios of the firm, GS Bank USA and GSI. 
 As described in Other Restrictions below, in September 2016, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would, among other things, require FHCs to hold additional capital in connection with covered physical commodity activities. 
 Leverage Ratios. Under the Capital Framework, we and GS Bank USA are subject to Tier 1 leverage ratios and SLRs established by the FRB. In April 2018, the FRB and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a proposed rule which would replace the current 2% SLR buffer for G-SIBs, including us, with a buffer equal to 50% of their G-SIB buffer. This proposal and the proposal to use SA-CCR for purposes of calculating the SLR would implement certain of the revisions to the leverage ratio framework published by the Basel Committee in December 2017. 
 The Basel Committee has also issued consultation papers on, among other matters, changes to leverage ratio treatment of client cleared derivatives and the public disclosure of daily average balances for certain components of leverage ratio calculations. 
 The European Commissions November 2016 proposal to amend the CRR would implement the Basel III leverage ratio framework by establishing a 3% minimum leverage ratio requirement for certain E.U. financial institutions, including GSI and GSIB, but it has not been enacted.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 
 See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information about our and GS Bank USAs Tier 1 leverage ratios and SLRs, and GSIs leverage ratio. 
 Liquidity Ratios. The Basel Committees framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring requires banking organizations to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). 
 The LCR rule issued by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies and applicable to both us and GS Bank USA is generally consistent with the Basel Committees framework and is designed to ensure that a banking organization maintains an adequate level of unencumbered, high-quality liquid assets equal to or greater than the expected net cash outflows under an acute short-term liquidity stress scenario. The LCR rule issued by the European Commission and applicable to GSI and GSIB is also generally consistent with the Basel Committees framework. We are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. We disclose, on a quarterly basis, our average daily LCR over the quarter. See Available Information. 
 The NSFR is designed to promote medium- and long-term stable funding of the assets and off-balance-sheet activities of banking organizations over a one-year time horizon. The Basel Committees NSFR framework requires banking organizations to maintain a minimum NSFR of 100%. 
 In May 2016, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a proposed rule that would implement the NSFR for large U.S. banking organizations, including us and GS Bank USA. The European Commissions November 2016 proposal to amend the CRR would implement the NSFR for certain E.U. financial institutions. Neither the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies nor the European Commission have released a final rule. 
 The FRBs enhanced prudential standards require BHCs, including Group Inc., with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets, to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards, which include maintaining a level of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days, and increased involvement by boards of directors in liquidity and overall risk management. Although the liquidity requirement under these rules has some similarities to the LCR, it is a separate requirement. 

 See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Risk Management  Overview and Structure of Risk Management and  Liquidity Risk Management in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for information about the LCR and NSFR, as well as our risk management practices and liquidity. 
 Stress Tests. As required by the FRBs annual CCAR rules, we submit a capital plan for review by the FRB. In addition, we are required to perform company-run stress tests on a semi-annual basis, although the FRB has recently proposed to reduce the required frequency of these tests to annually. We publish summaries of our stress tests results on our website as described in Available Information below. 
 Our annual stress test submission is incorporated into the annual capital plans that we submit to the FRB as part of the CCAR process for large BHCs, which is designed to ensure that capital planning processes will permit continued operations by such institutions during times of economic and financial stress. As part of CCAR, the FRB evaluates an institutions plan to make capital distributions, such as by repurchasing or redeeming stock or making dividend payments, across a range of macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions based on the institutions and the FRBs stress tests. If the FRB objects to an institutions capital plan, the institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions other than those to which the FRB has not objected. In addition, an institution faces limitations on capital distributions to the extent that actual capital issuances are less than the amounts indicated in its capital plan. 
 In April 2018, the FRB issued a proposed rule to establish stress buffer requirements. Under the proposal, the SCB would replace the component of the capital conservation buffer. The SCB, subject to a minimum, would reflect stressed losses in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the FRBs CCAR stress tests and would also include four quarters of planned common stock dividends. The proposal would also introduce a stress leverage buffer requirement, similar to the SCB, which would apply to the Tier 1 leverage ratio. In addition, the proposal would require BHCs to reduce their planned capital distributions if those distributions would not be consistent with the applicable capital buffer constraints based on the BHCs own baseline scenario projections. 
 Under recent amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act, effective November 2019, depository institutions with total consolidated assets between $100 billion and $250 billion, such as GS Bank USA, will not be required to conduct annual company-run stress tests. GS Bank USA will not be required to conduct the annual company-run stress test in 2019. GSI and GSIB also have their own capital planning and stress testing process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under the PRAs Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 
 Dividends and Stock Repurchases. Dividend payments by Group Inc. to its shareholders and stock repurchases by Group Inc. are subject to the oversight of the FRB. 
 U.S. federal and state laws impose limitations on the payment of dividends by U.S. depository institutions, such as GS Bank USA. In general, the amount of dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by the entity in any calendar year is in excess of the current years net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the entity obtains prior regulatory approval. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entitys undivided profits (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus). 
 The applicable U.S. banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends if, in the banking regulators opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. 
 Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act requires BHCs to act as a source of strength to their bank subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries. This support may be required by the FRB at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it. Capital loans by a BHC to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In addition, if a BHC commits to a U.S. federal banking agency that it will maintain the capital of its bank subsidiary, whether in response to the FRBs invoking its source-of-strength authority or in response to other regulatory measures, that commitment will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee for the BHC and the bank will be entitled to priority payment in respect of that commitment, ahead of other creditors of the BHC. 

 Transactions between Affiliates. Transactions between GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates, on the other hand, are regulated by the FRB. These regulations generally limit the types and amounts of transactions (including credit extensions from GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries to Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates) that may take place and generally require those transactions to be on market terms or better to GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries. These regulations generally do not apply to transactions between GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the coverage and scope of these regulations, including by applying them to the credit exposure arising under derivative transactions, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions. 
 The BHC Act prohibits the FRB from requiring a payment by a BHC subsidiary to a depository institution if the functional regulator of that subsidiary objects to such payment. In such a case, the FRB could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture. 
 Resolution and Recovery. Group Inc. is required by the FRB and the FDIC to submit a periodic plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure (resolution plan). If the regulators jointly determine that an institution has failed to remediate identified shortcomings in its resolution plan and that its resolution plan, after any permitted resubmission, is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the regulators may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations or may jointly order the institutions to divest assets or operations in order to facilitate orderly resolution in the event of failure. In December 2018, the FRB and FDIC finalized guidance for resolution plan submissions which consolidated or superseded all prior guidance. See Risk Factors  The application of Group Inc.s proposed resolution strategy could result in greater losses for Group Inc.s security holders in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Regulatory Matters and Other Developments  Regulatory Matters  Resolution and Recovery Plans in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information about our resolution plan. 
 We are also required by the FRB to submit, on a periodic basis, a global recovery plan that outlines the steps that management could take to reduce risk, maintain sufficient liquidity, and conserve capital in times of prolonged stress. 




Goldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K | 11

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 
 The FDIC has issued a rule requiring each insured depository institution with $50 billion or more in assets, such as GS Bank USA, to provide a resolution plan. Our resolution plan for GS Bank USA must, among other things, demonstrate that it is adequately protected from risks arising from our other entities. 
 The federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted final rules imposing restrictions on qualified financial contracts (QFCs) entered into by G-SIBs. The rules began to phase in on January 1, 2019 and will be fully effective on January 1, 2020. The rules are intended to facilitate the orderly resolution of a failed G-SIB by limiting the ability of the G-SIB to enter into a QFC unless (i) the counterparty waives certain default rights in such contract arising upon the entry of the G-SIB or one of its affiliates into resolution, (ii) the contract does not contain enumerated prohibitions on the transfer of such contract and/or any related credit enhancement, and (iii) the counterparty agrees that the contract will be subject to the special resolution regimes set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act orderly liquidation authority (OLA) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950 (FDIA), described below. Compliance can be achieved by adhering to the ISDA Universal Protocol or U.S. ISDA Protocol described below. 
 Certain Group Inc. subsidiaries, along with those of a number of other major global banking organizations, adhere to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Universal Resolution Stay Protocol (ISDA Universal Protocol), which was developed and updated in coordination with the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international body that sets standards and coordinates the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies. The ISDA Universal Protocol imposes a stay on certain cross-default and early termination rights within standard ISDA derivative contracts and securities financing transactions between adhering parties in the event that one of them is subject to resolution in its home jurisdiction, including a resolution under the OLA or the FDIA in the U.S. In addition, certain Group Inc. subsidiaries adhere to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association 2018 U.S. Resolution Stay Protocol (U.S. ISDA Protocol), which was based on the ISDA Universal Protocol and was created to allow market participants to comply with the final QFC rules adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies. 

 The E.U. Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) establishes a framework for the recovery and resolution of financial institutions in the E.U., such as GSI and GSIB. The BRRD provides national supervisory authorities with tools and powers to pre-emptively address potential financial crises in order to promote financial stability and minimize taxpayers exposure to losses. The BRRD requires E.U. member states to grant bail-in powers to E.U. resolution authorities to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity. Financial institutions in the E.U. must provide that contracts enable such actions. 
 Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity. In December 2016, the FRB adopted a final rule establishing loss-absorbency and related requirements for BHCs that have been designated as U.S. G-SIBs, such as Group Inc. The rule became effective in January 2019 with no phase-in period. The rule addresses U.S. implementation of the FSBs total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) principles and term sheet on minimum TLAC requirements for G-SIBs (issued in November 2015). The rule (i) establishes minimum TLAC requirements, (ii) establishes minimum eligible long-term debt (i.e., debt that is unsecured, has a maturity of at least one year from issuance and satisfies certain additional criteria) requirements, (iii) prohibits certain parent company transactions and (iv) caps the amount of parent company liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt. 
 The rule also prohibits a BHC that has been designated as a U.S. G-SIB from (i) guaranteeing liabilities of subsidiaries that are subject to early termination provisions if the BHC enters into an insolvency or receivership proceeding, subject to an exception for guarantees permitted by rules of the U.S. federal banking agencies imposing restrictions on QFCs; (ii) incurring liabilities guaranteed by subsidiaries; (iii) issuing short-term debt; or (iv) entering into derivatives and certain other financial contracts with external counterparties. 
 Additionally, the rule caps, at 5% of the value of the parent companys eligible TLAC, the amount of unsecured non-contingent third-party liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt that could rank equally with or junior to eligible long-term debt. 
 The FSBs final TLAC standard requires certain material subsidiaries of a G-SIB organized outside of the G-SIBs home country, such as GSI and GSIB, to maintain amounts of TLAC directly or indirectly from the parent company. In July 2017, the FSB issued a final set of guiding principles on the implementation of the TLAC requirements applicable to material subsidiaries. 




12 | Goldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 
 The BRRD subjects institutions to a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), which is generally consistent with the FSBs TLAC standard. In June 2018, the Bank of England published a statement of policy on internal MREL, which requires a material U.K. subsidiary of an overseas banking group, such as GSI, to meet a minimum internal MREL requirement to facilitate the transfer of losses to its resolution entity, which for GSI is Group Inc. The transitional minimum internal MREL requirement began to phase in from January 1, 2019 and will become fully effective on January 1, 2022. In order to comply with the MREL statement of policy, bail-in triggers have been provided to the Bank of England over certain intercompany regulatory capital and senior debt instruments issued by GSI. These triggers enable the Bank of England to write down such instruments or convert such instruments to equity. The triggers can be exercised by the Bank of England if it determines that GSI has reached the point of non-viability and the FRB and the FDIC have not objected to the bail-in or if Group Inc. enters bankruptcy or similar proceedings. 
 The European Commissions November 2016 proposed amendments to the CRR and the BRRD include provisions that are designed to implement the FSBs minimum TLAC requirement for G-SIBs. The proposal would require subsidiaries of a non-E.U. G-SIB that account for more than 5% of its RWAs, operating income or leverage exposure, such as GSI, to meet 90% of the requirement applicable to E.U. G-SIBs.
In November 2016, the European Commission also proposed to amend CRD IV to require a non-E.U. G-SIB, such as us, to establish an E.U. intermediate holding company (E.U. IHC) if a firm has two or more of certain types of E.U. financial institution subsidiaries, including broker-dealers and banks. The European Commission also proposed amendments to the CRR that would require E.U. IHCs to satisfy MREL requirements and certain other prudential requirements. These proposals are subject to adoption at the E.U. level and, for the directives, implementing rulemakings by E.U. member states, which have not yet occurred. 

 Insolvency of an Insured Depository Institution or a Bank Holding Company. Under the FDIA, if the FDIC is appointed as conservator or receiver for an insured depository institution such as GS Bank USA, upon its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has broad powers, including the power: 
 

 | To transfer any of the depository institutions assets and liabilities to a new obligor, including a newly formed bridge bank, without the approval of the depository institutions creditors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | To enforce the depository institutions contracts pursuant to their terms without regard to any provisions triggered by the appointment of the FDIC in that capacity; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | To repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims, including deposits at non-U.S. branches and claims of debtholders of the institution, in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of GS Bank USA, the debtholders (other than depositors) would be treated differently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than, the depositors of GS Bank USA. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act created a new resolution regime (known as OLA) for BHCs and their affiliates that are systemically important and certain non-bank financial companies. Under OLA, the FDIC may be appointed as receiver for the systemically important institution and its failed non-bank subsidiaries if, upon the recommendation of applicable regulators, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury determines, among other things, that the institution is in default or in danger of default, that the institutions failure would have serious adverse effects on the U.S. financial system and that resolution under OLA would avoid or mitigate those effects. 
 If the FDIC is appointed as receiver under OLA, then the powers of the receiver, and the rights and obligations of creditors and other parties who have dealt with the institution, would be determined under OLA, and not under the bankruptcy or insolvency law that would otherwise apply. The powers of the receiver under OLA were generally based on the powers of the FDIC as receiver for depository institutions under the FDIA. 




Goldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K | 13

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 
 Substantial differences in the rights of creditors exist between OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC under OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditors claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings), and the right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a bridge entity. In addition, OLA limits the ability of creditors to enforce certain contractual cross-defaults against affiliates of the institution in receivership. The FDIC has issued a notice that it would likely resolve a failed FHC by transferring its assets to a bridge holding company under its single point of entry or SPOE strategy pursuant to OLA. 
 Deposit Insurance. Deposits at GS Bank USA have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limits. The FDICs Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions. GS Bank USAs assessment (subject to adjustment by the FDIC) is currently based on its average total consolidated assets less its average tangible equity during the assessment period, its supervisory ratings and specified forward-looking financial measures used to calculate the assessment rate. In addition, deposits at GSIB are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme up to the applicable limits. 
 Prompt Corrective Action. The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) requires the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks, such as GS Bank USA: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. 
 An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, as the capital category of an institution declines. Failure to meet the capital requirements could also require a depository institution to raise capital. Ultimately, critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator, as described in Insolvency of an Insured Depository Institution or a Bank Holding Company above. 

 The prompt corrective action regulations do not apply to BHCs. However, the FRB is authorized to take appropriate action at the BHC level, based upon the undercapitalized status of the BHCs depository institution subsidiaries. In certain instances relating to an undercapitalized depository institution subsidiary, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiarys capital restoration plan and might be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on that guarantee. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the BHC, the guarantee would take priority over the BHCs general unsecured creditors, as described in Source of Strength above. 
 Volcker Rule and Other Restrictions on Activities. As a BHC, we are subject to limitations on the types of business activities we may engage in. 
 Volcker Rule. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act referred to as the Volcker Rule became effective in July 2015. The Volcker Rule prohibits proprietary trading, but permits activities such as underwriting, market making and risk-mitigation hedging, requires an extensive compliance program and includes additional reporting and record-keeping requirements. 
 In addition, the Volcker Rule limits the sponsorship of, and investment in, covered funds (as defined in the rule) by banking entities, including us. It also limits certain types of transactions between us and our sponsored funds, similar to the limitations on transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates. Covered funds include our private equity funds, certain of our credit and real estate funds, our hedge funds and certain other investment structures. The limitation on investments in covered funds requires us to limit our investment in each such fund to 3% or less of the funds net asset value, and to limit our aggregate investment in all such funds to 3% or less of our Tier 1 capital. 
 The FRB has extended the conformance period to July 2022 for our investments in, and relationships with, certain legacy illiquid funds (as defined in the Volcker Rule) that were in place prior to December 2013. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information about our investments in such funds. 




14 | Goldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 
 In July 2018, the FRB, OCC, FDIC, CFTC and SEC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking intended to amend the application of the Volcker Rule based on the size and scope of a banking entitys trading activities and to clarify and amend certain definitions, requirements and exemptions. The ultimate impact of any amendments to the Volcker Rule will depend on, among other things, further rulemaking and implementation guidance from the relevant U.S. federal regulatory agencies and the development of market practices and standards. 
 Other Restrictions. FHCs generally can engage in a broader range of financial and related activities than are otherwise permissible for BHCs as long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for FHCs. The broader range of permissible activities for FHCs includes underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities and making investments in non-FHCs (merchant banking activities). In addition, certain FHCs are permitted to engage in certain commodities activities in the U.S. that may otherwise be impermissible for BHCs, so long as the assets held pursuant to these activities do not equal 5% or more of their consolidated assets. 
 The FRB, however, has the authority to limit an FHCs ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible, and will likely do so if the FHC does not satisfactorily meet certain requirements of the FRB. For example, if an FHC or any of its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries ceases to maintain its status as well-capitalized or well-managed, the FRB may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements, as well as additional limitations or conditions. If the deficiencies persist, the FHC may be required to divest its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries or to cease engaging in activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities. 
 If any insured depository institution subsidiary of an FHC fails to maintain at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the FHC would be subject to restrictions on certain new activities and acquisitions. 
 In addition, we are required to obtain prior FRB approval before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both within and outside the U.S. 

 In September 2016, the FRB issued a proposed rule which, if adopted, would impose new requirements on the physical commodity activities and certain merchant banking activities of FHCs. The proposed rule would, among other things, (i) require FHCs to hold additional capital in connection with covered physical commodity activities, including merchant banking investments in companies engaged in physical commodity activities; (ii) tighten the quantitative limits on permissible physical trading activity; and (iii) establish new public reporting requirements on the nature and extent of an FHCs physical commodity holdings and activities. In addition, in a September 2016 report, the FRB recommended that Congress repeal (i) the authority of FHCs to engage in merchant banking activities; and (ii) the authority described above for certain FHCs to engage in certain otherwise permissible commodities activities. 
 In June 2018, the FRB issued a final rule regarding single counterparty credit limits, which imposes more stringent requirements for credit exposures among major financial institutions. The final rule requires U.S. G-SIBs, such as us, to comply by January 1, 2020. In addition, the FRB has proposed early remediation requirements, which are modeled on the prompt corrective action regime, described in Prompt Corrective Action above, but are designed to require action to begin in earlier stages of a companys financial distress, based on a range of triggers, including capital and leverage, stress test results, liquidity and risk management. 
 In addition, New York State banking law imposes lending limits (which take into account credit exposure from derivative transactions) and other requirements that could impact the manner and scope of GS Bank USAs activities. 
 The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have issued guidance that focuses on transaction structures and risk management frameworks and that outlines high-level principles for safe-and-sound leveraged lending, including underwriting standards, valuation and stress testing. This guidance has, among other things, limited the percentage amount of debt that can be included in certain transactions. The status of this guidance is uncertain as the U.S. Government Accountability Office has determined that it is a rule subject to review under the Congressional Review Act.

Broker-Dealer and Securities Regulation 
 Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of clients funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping, the financing of clients purchases, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. In the U.S., the SEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws. GS&Co. is registered as a broker-dealer, a municipal advisor and an investment adviser with the SEC and as a broker-dealer in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. U.S. self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA and the NYSE, adopt rules that apply to, and examine, broker-dealers such as GS&Co. 
 U.S. state securities and other U.S. regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over GS&Co. Similarly, our businesses are also subject to regulation by various non-U.S. governmental and regulatory bodies and self-regulatory authorities in virtually all countries where we have offices, as described further below, as well as in Other Regulation. For a description of net capital requirements applicable to GS&Co., see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital  U.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
In Europe, we provide broker-dealer services that are subject to oversight by national regulators. These services are regulated in accordance with national laws, many of which implement E.U. directives, and, increasingly, by directly applicable E.U. regulations. These national and E.U. laws require, among other things, compliance with certain capital adequacy standards, customer protection requirements and market conduct and trade reporting rules. 
 Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), our regulated Japanese broker-dealer, is subject to capital requirements imposed by Japans Financial Services Agency. GSJCL is also regulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka Exchange, the Tokyo Financial Exchange, the Japan Securities Dealers Association, the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance, among others. 

 Also, the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Korean Financial Supervisory Service, the Reserve Bank of India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Securities Exchange, among others, regulate various of our subsidiaries and also have capital standards and other requirements comparable to the rules of the SEC. 
 Our exchange-based market-making activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of securities exchanges. As a market maker on exchanges, we are required to maintain orderly markets in the securities to which we are assigned. 
 In April 2018, the SEC issued a proposed rule that would require broker-dealers to act in the best interest of their customers, and also proposed an interpretation clarifying the SECs views of the existing fiduciary duty owed by investment advisers to their clients. Additionally, the SEC issued a proposed rule that would require broker-dealers and investment advisers to provide a standardized, short-form disclosure highlighting services offered, applicable standards of conduct, fees and costs, the differences between brokerage and advisory services, and any conflicts of interest. 
 In November 2018, the SEC adopted a final rule requiring broker-dealers to provide to specified customers at their request individualized information about the execution of certain stock orders, including how such orders were routed and the average rebates received or fees paid. 
 GS&Co., GS Bank USA and other U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to rules adopted by U.S. federal agencies pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act that require any person who organizes or initiates certain asset-backed securities transactions to retain a portion (generally, at least five percent) of any credit risk that the person conveys to a third party. For certain securitization transactions, retention by third-party purchasers may satisfy this requirement. 
 Securitizations would also be affected by rules proposed by the SEC to implement the Dodd-Frank Acts prohibition against securitization participants engaging in any transaction that would involve or result in any material conflict of interest with an investor in a securitization transaction. The proposed rules would exempt bona fide market-making activities and risk-mitigating hedging activities in connection with securitization activities from the general prohibition.

 The SEC, FINRA and regulators in various non-U.S. jurisdictions have imposed both conduct-based and disclosure-based requirements with respect to research reports and research analysts and may impose additional regulations. 
 Swaps, Derivatives and Commodities Regulation 
 The commodity futures, commodity options and swaps industry in the U.S. is subject to regulation under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The CFTC is the U.S. federal agency charged with the administration of the CEA. In addition, the SEC is the U.S. federal agency charged with the regulation of security-based swaps. The rules and regulations of various self-regulatory organizations, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, other futures exchanges and the National Futures Association, also govern commodity futures, commodity options and swaps activities. 
 The terms swaps and security-based swaps include a wide variety of derivative instruments in addition to those conventionally referred to as swaps (including certain forward contracts and options), and relate to a wide variety of underlying assets or obligations, including currencies, commodities, interest or other monetary rates, yields, indices, securities, credit events, loans and other financial obligations. 
 CFTC rules require registration of swap dealers, mandatory clearing and execution of interest rate and credit default swaps and real-time public reporting and adherence to business conduct standards for all in-scope swaps. In December 2016, the CFTC proposed revised capital regulations for swap dealers that are not subject to the capital rules of a prudential regulator, such as the FRB, as well as a liquidity requirement for those swap dealers. 
 SEC rules govern the registration and regulation of security-based swap dealers but compliance with such rules is not currently required. In October 2018, the SEC re-proposed, and requested comment on, a number of its rules for security-based swap dealers, including capital, margin and segregation requirements. 
 GS&Co. is registered with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant, and several of our subsidiaries, including GS&Co., are registered with the CFTC and act as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors. GS&Co. and other subsidiaries, including GS Bank USA, GSI and J. Aron & Company LLC (J. Aron), are registered with the CFTC as swap dealers. In addition, GS&Co. and Goldman Sachs Financial Markets, L.P. are registered with the SEC as OTC derivatives dealers. 

 Our affiliates registered as swap dealers are subject to the margin rules issued by the CFTC (in the case of our non-bank swap dealers) and the FRB (in the case of GS Bank USA). The rules for variation margin have become effective, and those for initial margin will phase in through September 2020 depending on certain activity levels of the swap dealer and the relevant counterparty. In contrast to the FRB margin rules, inter-affiliate transactions under the CFTC margin rules are generally exempt from initial margin requirements. 
 The CFTC has proposed position limit rules that will limit the size of positions in physical commodity derivatives that can be held by any entity, or any group of affiliates or other parties trading under common control, subject to certain exemptions, such as for bona fide hedging positions. These proposed rules would apply to positions in swaps, as well as futures and options on futures. 
 Similar types of swap regulation have been proposed or adopted in jurisdictions outside the U.S., including in the E.U. and Japan. For example, the E.U. has established regulatory requirements relating to portfolio reconciliation and reporting, clearing certain OTC derivatives and margining for uncleared derivatives activities under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation. 
 The CFTC has adopted rules relating to cross-border regulation of swaps, and has proposed cross-border business conduct and registration rules. The CFTC has entered into agreements with certain non-U.S. regulators, including in the E.U., regarding the cross-border regulation of derivatives and the mutual recognition of cross-border clearing houses, and has approved substituted compliance with certain non-U.S. regulations, including E.U. regulations, related to certain business conduct requirements and margin rules. The U.S. prudential regulators have not yet made a determination with respect to substituted compliance for transactions subject to non-U.S. margin rules. 
 J. Aron is authorized by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to sell wholesale physical power at market-based rates. As a FERC-authorized power marketer, J. Aron is subject to regulation under the U.S. Federal Power Act and FERC regulations and to the oversight of FERC. As a result of our investing activities, Group Inc. is also an exempt holding company under the U.S. Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and applicable FERC rules. 




Goldman Sachs 2018 Form 10-K | 17

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 
 In addition, as a result of our power-related and commodities activities, we are subject to energy, environmental and other governmental laws and regulations, as described in Risk Factors  Our commodities activities, particularly our physical commodities activities, subject us to extensive regulation and involve certain potential risks, including environmental, reputational and other risks that may expose us to significant liabilities and costs in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.Investment Management Regulation 
 Our investment management business is subject to significant regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world relating to, among other things, the safeguarding of client assets, offerings of funds, marketing activities, transactions among affiliates and our management of client funds. 
 The SEC has adopted rules relating to liquidity risk management that require registered open-end funds to classify and review the liquidity of their portfolio assets. In addition, the rules require funds to make disclosures relating to their liquidity risk management program and report to the SEC instances when a funds percentage of illiquid investments exceeds certain thresholds or when certain funds experience shortfalls in their highly liquid investments. While some rules became effective in December 2018, certain portfolio asset classification and disclosure requirements will become effective in June 2019 and December 2019. 
 Certain of our European subsidiaries, including GSAMI, are subject to the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive and related regulations, which govern the approval, organizational, marketing and reporting requirements of E.U.-based alternative investment managers and the ability of alternative investment fund managers located outside the E.U. to access the E.U. market. 
 An E.U. regulation relating to money market funds, including provisions prescribing minimum levels of daily and weekly liquidity, clear labeling of money market funds and internal credit risk assessments, became effective in July 2018. 
 Compensation Practices 
 Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the FRB and, with respect to some of our subsidiaries and employees, by other regulatory bodies worldwide. The scope and content of compensation regulation in the financial industry are continuing to develop, and we expect that these regulations and resulting market practices will evolve over a number of years. 

 The FSB has released standards for local regulators to implement certain compensation principles for banks and other financial companies designed to encourage sound compensation practices. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have provided guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements: (i) the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk; (ii) the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and (iii) the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance. The guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated, as appropriate, into the organizations supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The guidance also provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management, control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act requires the U.S. financial regulators, including the FRB and SEC, to adopt rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets (including Group Inc. and some of its depository institution, broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries). The U.S. financial regulators proposed revised rules in 2016, which have not been finalized. 
 In October 2016, the NYDFS issued guidance emphasizing that its regulated banking institutions, including GS Bank USA, must ensure that any incentive compensation arrangements tied to employee performance indicators are subject to effective risk management, oversight and control. 
 In the E.U., the CRR and CRD IV include compensation provisions designed to implement the FSBs compensation standards. These rules have been implemented by E.U. member states and, among other things, limit the ratio of variable to fixed compensation of certain employees, including those identified as having a material impact on the risk profile of E.U.-regulated entities, including GSI. 
 The E.U. has also introduced rules regulating compensation for certain persons providing services to certain investment funds. These requirements are in addition to the guidance issued by U.S. financial regulators described above and the Dodd-Frank Act provision described above.

 Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Bribery Rules and Regulations 
 The U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (PATRIOT Act), contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various regulations applicable to all financial institutions, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities. Through these and other provisions, the BSA and the PATRIOT Act seek to promote the identification of parties that may be involved in terrorism, money laundering or other suspicious activities. Anti-money laundering laws outside the U.S. contain some similar provisions. 
 In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the U.K. Bribery Act, relating to corrupt and illegal payments to, and hiring practices with regard to, government officials and others. The scope of the types of payments or other benefits covered by these laws is very broad and regulators are frequently using enforcement proceedings to define the scope of these laws. The obligation of financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, to identify their clients, to monitor for and report suspicious transactions, to monitor direct and indirect payments to government officials, to respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and to share information with other financial institutions, has required the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls. 
 Privacy and Cyber Security Regulation 
 Certain of our businesses are subject to laws and regulations enacted by U.S. federal and state governments, the E.U. or other non-U.S. jurisdictions and/or enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, including the GLB Act, the E.U.s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which took effect on May 25, 2018, the Japanese Personal Information Protection Act, the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, the Australian Privacy Act and the Brazilian Bank Secrecy Law. The GDPR has heightened our privacy compliance obligations, impacted our businesses collection, processing and retention of personal data and imposed strict standards for reporting data breaches. The GDPR also provides for significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) was enacted in June 2018 and is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2020 and will impose privacy compliance obligations with regard to the personal information of California residents. 

 The NYDFS also requires financial institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including GS Bank USA, to, among other things, (i) establish and maintain a cyber security program designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information systems; (ii) implement and maintain a written cyber security policy setting forth policies and procedures for the protection of their information systems and nonpublic information; and (iii) designate a Chief Information Security Officer. In addition, in October 2016, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on potential enhanced cyber risk management standards for large financial institutions. 
 Other Regulation 
 U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies, regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions and other state regulators in the U.S., are empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, or the suspension or expulsion of a regulated entity or its directors, officers or employees. In particular, state attorneys general have become much more active in seeking fines and penalties in enforcement led by the federal regulators. In addition, a number of our other activities require us to obtain licenses, adhere to applicable regulations and be subject to the oversight of various regulators in the jurisdictions in which we conduct these activities. 
 MiFID II includes extensive market structure reforms, such as the establishment of new trading venue categories for the purposes of discharging the obligation to trade OTC derivatives on a trading platform and enhanced pre- and post-trade transparency covering a wider range of financial instruments. In equities, MiFID II introduced volume caps on non-transparent liquidity trading for trading venues, limited the use of broker-dealer crossing networks and created a new regime for systematic internalizers, which are investment firms that execute client transactions outside a trading venue. 
 Additional control requirements were introduced for algorithmic trading, high frequency trading and direct electronic access. Commodities trading firms are required to calculate their positions and adhere to specific limits. Other reforms introduced enhanced transaction reporting, the publication of best execution data by investment firms and trading venues, transparency on costs and charges of service to investors, changes to the way investment managers can pay for the receipt of investment research and mandatory unbundling for broker-dealers between execution and other major services.

 The E.U. and national financial legislators and regulators in the E.U. have proposed or adopted numerous further market reforms that may impact our businesses, including heightened corporate governance standards for financial institutions, rules on key information documents for packaged retail and insurance-based investment products and rules on indices that are used as benchmarks for financial instruments or funds. In addition, the European Commission, the European Securities and Markets Authority and the European Banking Authority have announced or are formulating regulatory standards and other measures which will impact our European operations. Certain of our European subsidiaries are also regulated by the securities, derivatives and commodities exchanges of which they are members. 
 As described above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements in jurisdictions throughout the world. Subsidiaries not subject to separate regulation may hold capital to satisfy local tax guidelines, rating agency requirements or internal policies, including policies concerning the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based upon its underlying risk.

 We have included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, and from time to time our management may make, statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside our control. 
 These statements include statements other than historical information or statements of current conditions and may relate to our future plans and objectives and results, among other things, and may also include statements about the effect of changes to the capital, leverage, liquidity, long-term debt and TLAC rules applicable to banks and BHCs, the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our businesses and operations, and various legal proceedings, governmental investigations or mortgage-related contingencies as set forth in both Notes 27 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, as well as statements about the results of our Dodd-Frank Act and our stress tests, statements about the objectives and effectiveness of our business continuity plan, information security program, risk management and liquidity policies, statements about our resolution plan and resolution strategy and their implications for our debtholders and other stakeholders, statements about the design and effectiveness of our resolution capital and liquidity models and our triggers and alerts framework, statements about trends in or growth opportunities for our businesses, statements about our future status, activities or reporting under U.S. or non-U.S. banking and financial regulation, statements about our investment banking transaction backlog, statements about our expected tax rate, statements about the estimated impact of new accounting standards, statements about the level of capital actions, statements about our expected interest income, statements about our credit exposures, statements about our preparations for Brexit, including our plan to manage a hard Brexit scenario, statements about the replacement of LIBOR and other IBORs and the objectives of our program related to the transition from IBORs to alternative risk-free reference rates, and statements about the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses.

 By identifying these statements for you in this manner, we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ from those indicated in these forward-looking statements include, among others, those described below and in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Statements about our investment banking transaction backlog are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that we actually earn from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For information about other important factors that could adversely affect our investment banking transactions, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Statements about our expected 2019 effective income tax rate are subject to the risk that our tax rate may differ from the anticipated rate indicated in such statements, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in our earnings mix, our profitability and entities in which we generate profits, the assumptions we have made in forecasting our expected tax rate, as well as guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. 
 We provided in this filing information regarding our NSFR. The statements with respect to our NSFR are forward-looking statements, based on our current interpretation, expectations and understandings of the relevant proposal, and reflect significant assumptions about the treatment of various assets and liabilities and the manner in which our NSFR is calculated. As a result, the methods used to calculate our NSFR may differ, possibly materially, from those used in calculating our NSFR for any future disclosures. The ultimate methods of calculating our NSFR will depend on, among other things, rulemaking from the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies and the development of market practices and standards.
