ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “Lightbridge”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, and “us” refer to Lightbridge Corporation together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries Lightbridge International Holding LLC and Thorium Power Inc.
 
Company Overview
 
Lightbridge is a leading nuclear fuel technology company. Our goal is to produce the next generation of nuclear fuel that could significantly improve the economics, safety, and proliferation resistance of existing and new reactors, with a meaningful impact on addressing climate change and air pollution. We project that the world’s energy and climate needs can only be met if nuclear power’s share of the energy-generating mix grows substantially.
 
Our primary focus is the development and commercialization of metallic fuel rods that will replace the uranium oxide ceramic pellets that have traditionally fueled nuclear reactors. We believe our metallic fuel offers significant economic and safety benefits over traditional fuel, primarily because of the superior heat transfer properties of all-metal fuel and the resulting lower operating temperature of the reactor. We also believe that uprating a reactor with Lightbridge fuel will add incremental electricity at a lower levelized cost than any other means of generating baseload electric power, including any renewable, fossil, or hydroelectric energy source.
 
We have built a significant portfolio of patents reflecting years of research and development, and we anticipate substantial completion of our research efforts and the testing of our fuel over the next few years. We expect the first purchase orders for our metallic fuel as soon as 2028, with final deployment of our fuel in commercial reactors as soon as 2030.
 
From 2008 to 2018, we also had a nuclear consulting business segment, which provided early funding for our metallic nuclear fuel development efforts. We discontinued our consulting business segment in 2018; however, we may opportunistically provide nuclear power consulting and strategic advisory services to commercial and governmental entities worldwide.
 
Enfission, LLC
 
On January 24, 2018 we formed Enfission, LLC (“Enfission”), a 50/50 joint venture with Framatome Inc., to develop, license, manufacture, and sell nuclear fuel assemblies based on Lightbridge-designed metallic fuel technology and other advanced nuclear fuel intellectual property. Framatome Inc. is a wholly-owned US subsidiary of Framatome, which we refer to individually or collectively in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, together with their affiliates, as Framatome. Framatome is a global leader in designing, manufacturing, and installing components and fuel for nuclear power plants, and Framatome offers a full range of reactor services.
 
We currently conduct our fuel development activities principally through Enfission. Enfission serves as the exclusive vehicle through which the Company and Framatome are researching, developing, obtaining regulatory approvals, manufacturing and will be using, marketing and selling nuclear fuel assemblies based on the Lightbridge metallic fuel technology comprising uranium-zirconium (U-Zr) multi-lobe, helically twisted fuel rods and associated manufacturing processes and other advanced nuclear fuel intellectual property contributed by both Lightbridge and Framatome within the operating domain. The operating domain of Enfission includes pressurized water reactors (excluding water-cooled water-moderated energetic reactor (Russian VVER) types) and boiling water reactors, which collectively constitute most of the power reactors in the world, as well as water-cooled small modular reactors and water-cooled research reactors. While we expect our focus to be on Enfission for the foreseeable future, Lightbridge maintains the rights to develop fuel for VVER reactors outside Enfission, and Lightbridge also maintains the right to develop fuel for pressurized heavy water reactors (including CANDU reactors) outside Enfission.

In addition to distributions from Enfission based on our ownership interest in the joint venture, we anticipate receiving future licensing revenues in connection with sales by Enfission of nuclear fuel incorporating our intellectual property. 
 
Lightbridge and Enfission’s principal executive offices are located at 11710 Plaza America Drive, Suite 2000, Reston, Virginia 20190 USA.
 
Nuclear Power as Clean and Low Carbon Emissions Energy Source
 
Nuclear power provides clean, reliable baseload electricity generation source. According to the World Nuclear Association (WNA), nuclear power plants produce no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, and over the course of its life-cycle, nuclear produces about the same amount of CO2 equivalent emissions per unit of electricity as wind. The WNA further notes that almost all proposed pathways to achieving significant decarbonization suggest an increased role for nuclear power, including those published by the International Energy Agency, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Energy Initiative, US Energy Information Administration, and World Energy Council.
 
We believe that deep cuts to CO2 emissions are only possible with electrification of most of the transportation and industrial sectors globally and powering them and the current electricity needs of the world with non-emitting or low-emitting power. We believe this can be done only with a large increase in nuclear power, several times the amount that is generated globally today. We believe that our nuclear fuel technology will be an essential element of reaching this goal.

 
Overview of Our Next Generation Nuclear Fuel
 
Nuclear Fuel Development
 
Since 2008, we have been engaged in the design and development of proprietary, innovative nuclear fuels to improve the cost competitiveness, safety, proliferation resistance and performance of nuclear power generation. In 2010, we announced the concept of all-metal fuel (i.e., non-oxide fuel) for currently operating as well as new-build reactors. Our focus on metallic fuel is based on listening to the voices of prospective customers, as nuclear utilities have expressed interest in the improved economics and enhanced safety that we believe metallic fuel can provide.
 
The fuel in a nuclear reactor generates heat energy. That heat is then converted through steam into electricity that is sold. We have designed our innovative, proprietary metallic fuels to be capable of significantly higher burnup and power density compared to conventional oxide nuclear fuels. Burnup is the total amount of electricity generated per unit mass of nuclear fuel and is a function of the power density of a nuclear fuel and the amount of time the fuel operates in the reactor. Power density is the amount of heat power generated per unit volume of nuclear fuel. Conventional oxide fuel used in existing commercial reactors is just about at the limit of its burnup and power density capability. As a result, further optimization to increase power output from the same core size and improve the economics and safety of nuclear power generation using conventional oxide fuel technologies is limited. A new fuel is needed to bring enhanced performance to reactors; we are developing that new fuel.

As the nuclear industry prepares to meet the increasing global demand for electricity production, longer operating cycles and higher reactor power outputs have become a much sought-after solution for the current and future reactor fleet. We believe our proprietary nuclear fuel designs have the potential to improve the nuclear power industry’s economics by:
 

· | providing an increase in power output of potentially up to 10% while simultaneously extending the operating cycle length from 18 to 24 months in existing pressurized water reactors (PWRs), including in Westinghouse-type four-loop PWR plants which are currently constrained to an 18-month operating cycle by oxide fuel, or increasing the power potentially up to 17% while retaining an 18-month operating cycle;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | enabling increased reactor power output via a power uprate (potentially up to a 30% increase) or a longer operating cycle (instead of a power uprate) without changing the core size in new build PWRs; and 
· | reducing the volume of spent fuel per unit of electricity generated as well as enhancing proliferation resistance of spent fuel. 

 
We believe our fuel designs will allow current and new build nuclear reactors to safely increase power production and reduce operations and maintenance costs on a per kilowatt-hour basis. New build nuclear reactors could also benefit from the reduced upfront capital investment per kilowatt of generating capacity in case of implementing a power uprate. In addition to the projected electricity production cost savings, we believe that our technology can result in utilities or countries needing to deploy fewer new reactors to generate the same amount of electricity (in case of a power uprate), resulting in significant capital cost savings. For utilities or countries that already have operating reactors, our technology could be utilized to increase the power output of those reactors as opposed to building new reactors. 
 
Due to the significantly lower fuel operating temperature, our metallic nuclear fuel rods are also expected to provide major improvements to safety margins during off-normal events. US Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing processes require engineering analysis of a large break loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), as well as many other scenarios. The LOCA scenario assumes failure of a large water pipe in the reactor coolant system. Under LOCA conditions, the fuel and cladding temperatures rise due to reduced cooling capacity. Preliminary analytical modeling shows that under a design-basis LOCA scenario, unlike conventional uranium dioxide fuel, the cladding of the Lightbridge-designed metallic fuel rods would stay at least 200 degrees below the 850-900 degrees Celsius temperature at which steam begins to react with the zirconium cladding to generate hydrogen gas. Build-up of hydrogen gas in a nuclear power plant can lead to the hydrogen exploding, which is what happened at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan in 2011. Lightbridge fuel is designed to prevent hydrogen gas generation in design-basis LOCA situations, which is a major safety benefit.
 
Anticipated advantages of Lightbridge’s metallic fuel over the conventional uranium dioxide fuels used now
 


· | Has better heat transfer (due to higher thermal conductivity and greater surface area of fuel rods) and therefore increases power output from nuclear reactors
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Operates at lower operating temperatures than current conventional nuclear fuel, contributing to lower stored energy 
· | Can reach higher burnups and extend the cycle length 
· | Has the ability to maneuver more quickly (load follow) 


6


· | Under design basis accidents when there is a loss of coolant in the reactor, does not generate hydrogen gas, which can explode
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Buys more time to restore active cooling in the reactor during off-normal events 
· | Improves non-proliferation benefits of spent nuclear fuel 
· | Enhances structural integrity of the nuclear fuel 
· | Lighter and stiffer fuel assembly with likely improved seismic performance 

Lightbridge Spent Fuel – Proliferation Resistance
 
The April 2018 issue of Nuclear Engineering and Design, a technical journal affiliated with the European Nuclear Society, included an article stating that after analyzing Lightbridge’s fuel, the authors concluded that any plutonium extracted from Lightbridge’s spent fuel would not be useable for weapon purposes. We anticipate the following proliferation resistance advantages for our metallic fuel:

· | ½ of the amount of plutonium produced and remaining in the spent fuel as compared to conventional uranium oxide fuels 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Lower Plutonium-239 fraction compared to uranium oxide fuel, therefore our spent fuel would be unsuitable as a source for weapon purposes

Nuclear Utility Fuel Advisory Board (“NUFAB”)
 
Our NUFAB, formed in 2011, comprises senior fuel managers from electric utilities that account for approximately 50% of installed US nuclear capacity. NUFAB members represent the “voice of the customer” in Lightbridge’s nuclear fuel development and commercialization activities. These members include the following:

· | Exelon Generation;

Anticipated Schedule for Development and Sale of Nuclear Fuel Assemblies
 
Set forth below is our anticipated schedule for Enfission’s development and sale of nuclear fuel assemblies. Please see Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report, for a discussion of certain risks that may delay or impair the commercialization of nuclear fuel assemblies incorporating our nuclear fuel technology. Based on our current expectations, we anticipate that, either directly or through Enfission, we will:

· | Enter into a Lead Test Assembly agreement with a host reactor in 2020-2022; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Start test reactor irradiation of material samples in 2020-2022; 
· | Perform out-of-reactor corrosion experiments in 2020-2022; 
· | Start Lead Test Rod operation in a United States commercial reactor in 2022-2024; 
· | Establish a pilot-scale fuel fabrication facility for Lead Test Assemblies in 2022-2024; and
· | Begin Lead Test Assembly operation in a commercial nuclear power plant in 2024-2026. 

 
Accordingly, based on our current expected schedule, a purchase order for an initial reload batch placed by a utility is expected as soon as 2028-2030, with final qualification (i.e., deployment of fuel in the first reload batch) in a commercial reactor expected as soon as 2030-2032. We are seeking development funding contributions or other financing arrangements with utilities and the US Department of Energy.
 
Our earlier plan was to begin irradiation of metallic fuel samples in the Halden research reactor in 2020-2021. The Halden research reactor was operated by the Institute for Energy Technology (IFE) in Norway. In June 2018, IFE’s board of directors announced its decision not to seek renewal of the Halden reactor operating license beyond 2020, and to permanently shut down the reactor immediately. 
 
In lieu of the Halden Reactor in Norway, the Company now plans to conduct the initial testing and demonstration of its advanced metallic nuclear fuel in the United States.

Ownership and Management of Enfission
 
Lightbridge owns 50 percent of Enfission’s Class A voting membership units and Framatome owns the other 50 percent. Any distributions will be first allocated to cause the capital accounts of the initial members to be equal, then allocated on a 50/50 basis. Lightbridge and Framatome each provided certain licensed intellectual property to Enfission. Certain additional capital contributions made by Lightbridge and Framatome will partly be in the form of exclusive license rights to intellectual property developed pursuant to a research and development service agreement with Enfission.
 
Seth Grae, our Chief Executive Officer, also serves as Chief Executive Officer of Enfission. Enfission is managed by a board of directors composed of six directors, half of whom are appointed by Lightbridge and the other half are appointed by Framatome. The Enfission board acts by majority vote, provided that at least one director appointed by each of Lightbridge and Framatome votes in favor of the action. Certain major decisions require the approval of at least two-thirds of the directors, and certain fundamental decisions, including amending the Enfission operating agreement and issuing additional membership units, require the approval of two-thirds of the Class A members.
 
Agreements with Enfission and Framatome
 
Enfission has entered into several agreements with Lightbridge and Framatome relating to intellectual property, the provision of personnel and administrative support to Enfission, and research and development efforts.
 
Lightbridge and Framatome have also directly entered into binding agreements forming the foundation for Enfission, including the following agreements in November 2017, which govern joint research and development activities and the treatment of all related existing and future intellectual property:
 


· | R&D Services Agreement (“RDSA”) — The RDSA defines the terms and conditions for joint research and development activities between Framatome and Lightbridge. Enfission is a party to the RDSA. Key terms and conditions of the RDSA include: (i) designating a 17x17 fuel assembly as the first joint project of the parties; (ii) establishing a framework for future work release orders relating to research and development activities of the parties; and (iii) granting rights to the use of background and foreground intellectual property needed to perform research and development activities.

Other Commercial Applications for Our Nuclear Fuel Technology
 
We retain the right to commercialize our nuclear fuel technology outside of the domain encompassed by Enfission, most notably in VVERs and Heavy Water Reactors (HWRs), including Canada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) reactors. We anticipate most of our efforts for the foreseeable future will be directed towards Enfission.
Competition
 
To our knowledge, our nuclear fuel technology is the only technology that could be commercially viable in the foreseeable future to increase, in a safe and economically attractive way, power output potentially by up to 17% in existing PWRs and up to 30% in new build PWRs. Due to long product development timelines, significant nuclear regulatory requirements, and our intellectual property, we believe that the barriers to entry are very high for a competitor to our nuclear fuel technology.
 
Currently competition with respect to the design of commercially viable nuclear fuel products is limited to conventional uranium oxide fuels, which are reaching the limits in terms of their capability to provide increased power output or longer fuel cycles. We believe that the industry needs fuel products that can provide these benefits. While we believe conventional uranium oxide fuel may be capable of achieving power uprates of up to 10% in existing PWRs, doing so would require uranium-235 enrichment levels above 5% (as is also the case with our metallic fuel), higher reload batch sizes, or a combination thereof. The alternative route of increasing reload batch sizes while keeping uranium enrichment levels below 5% for power uprates up to 10% using conventional uranium oxide fuel raises the cost of each fuel reload, resulting in a significant fuel cycle cost penalty to the nuclear utility. The cost penalty could have a dramatic adverse impact on the economics of existing plants whose original capital cost has already been written off, which includes most US nuclear power plants.
 
Nuclear power faces competition from other sources of electricity, including natural gas, which is currently the cheapest option for power generation in the US and has resulted in some utilities abandoning nuclear power. Other sources of electricity may also be viewed as safer than nuclear power, although we believe that generating nuclear energy with Lightbridge fuel is the safest way to produce baseload electricity in suitable power reactors. To the extent demand for electricity generated by nuclear power decreases, the potential market for our nuclear fuel technology will decline.
 
In addition to conventional uranium dioxide fuel, potential competition to our metallic fuel technology can come from so-called Accident Tolerant Fuels (ATF). After the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011, the US Congress directed the US Department of Energy (DOE) to investigate every aspect of nuclear plant operation including the existing uranium dioxide fuel pellets enveloped by zirconium‐based alloy tubes (cladding). According to the February 2019 Nuclear Energy Institute technical report on ATF titled “Safety and Economic Benefits of Accident Tolerant Fuel”, advanced fuel design concepts (such as ATF) were accelerated by combining recent operating experience with worldwide research and development. Over the past several years, the ATF program has received significant DOE funding support and initial interest from utility customers in ATF demonstration programs in their operating reactors. However, we believe that the ATF concepts may only offer incremental safety and operating improvements over conventional uranium dioxide fuel that could not effectively compete with the safety and economic benefits of our metallic fuel. In addition, some of the ATF concepts may be used in combination with our metallic fuel for additional safety and operating improvements.

Raw Materials
 
We do not plan to utilize any raw materials directly in the conduct of our operations. The fuel fabricators which will ultimately fabricate fuel products incorporating our nuclear fuel technology will require zirconium and uranium, and additional raw materials that are required for the production of nuclear fuel assemblies that go into the reactor core. Uranium and zirconium are available from various suppliers at market prices. Our plan is that utilities will contract with Enfission to order nuclear fuel assemblies, and Enfission will subcontract manufacturing of fuel assemblies to Framatome, which will physically produce and then ship the completed nuclear fuel assemblies to the reactor sites on behalf of Enfission.
 
Government Support/Approvals and Relationships with Critical Development Partners/Vendors
 
The sales and marketing of our services and technology internationally may be subject to US export control regulations and the export control laws of other countries. Governmental authorizations may be required before we can export our services or technology or collaborate with foreign entities. If authorizations are required and not granted, our international business plans could be materially affected. Furthermore, the export authorization process is often time consuming. Violation of export control regulations could subject us to fines and other penalties, such as losing the ability to export for a period of years, which would limit our revenue growth opportunities and significantly hinder our attempts to expand our business internationally.
 
In 2015-2016, we received our export controls authorization from the US Department of Energy for all of our planned work outside the United States, specifically in France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Canada.
 
The testing, fabrication and use of nuclear fuels by Enfission and our future partners, licensees and nuclear power generators will be heavily regulated. The test facilities and other locations where our fuel designs may be tested before commercial use require governmental approvals from the host country’s nuclear regulatory authority. The responsibility for obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals will lie with our research and development contractors that conduct such tests and experiments. Nuclear fuel fabricators, which will ultimately fabricate fuel using our technology under commercial licenses from us, are similarly regulated. Utilities that operate nuclear power plants that may utilize the fuel produced by these fuel fabricators require specific licenses relating to possession and use of nuclear materials as well as numerous other governmental approvals for the ownership and operation of nuclear power plants.
 
Certain Challenges
 
The ability to fabricate the lead test assemblies (LTAs) and a nuclear utility that is willing to accept the LTAs, is required for LTA demonstration in a commercial reactor. In the US, the fabricator and the utility will be primarily responsible for securing necessary regulatory licensing approvals for the LTA operation. To this end, in 2011, we established a Nuclear Utility Fuel Advisory Board (NUFAB) to further strengthen dialogue with global nuclear utilities. Separately, we formed Enfission with the fabricator Framatome to complete the development, demonstration, regulatory licensing, and commercial deployment of our metallic nuclear fuel in most types of reactors that are currently in operation, under construction, and planned around the world.

 
Establishment of required supply chain infrastructure to support high assay low enriched uranium (HALEU) metallic fuel. Existing commercial nuclear infrastructure, including conversion facilities, enrichment facilities, fabrication facilities, fuel storage facilities, fuel handling procedures, fuel operation at reactor sites, used fuel storage facilities and shipping containers, were designed and are currently licensed to handle uranium in oxide form with enrichment up to 5%. Our fuel designs are expected to use uranium metal with uranium enrichment levels up to 19.75% and would therefore require certain modifications to existing commercial nuclear infrastructure to enable commercial nuclear facilities to handle our fuels. Those nuclear facilities will need to go through a regulatory licensing process and obtain regulatory approvals to be able to process, handle, or ship uranium metal with enrichment levels up to 19.75% and operate commercial reactors and spent fuel storage facilities using our metallic fuel. 
 


11

 
There is a lack of publicly available experimental data on our metallic fuel. We will need to conduct various irradiation experiments to confirm fuel performance under normal and off-normal events. Loop irradiation in a test reactor environment prototypic of commercial reactor operating conditions and other experiments on unirradiated and irradiated metallic fuel samples will be essential to demonstrate the performance and advantages of our metallic fuel. We are currently planning loop irradiation testing of our metallic fuel samples in a research reactor as part of this effort.

 
Existing analytical models may be inadequate. New analytical models, capable of accurately predicting the behavior of our metallic fuel during normal operation and off-normal events, may be required. Experimental data measured from our planned irradiation demonstrations will help to identify areas where new analytical models or modifications to existing ones may be required.

 
Demonstration of a fabrication process both for semi-scale irradiation fuel samples and subsequently for full-length (12-14 feet) metallic fuel rods for PWR LTAs is required. Past operating experience with differently shaped fuel rods with a similar metallic fuel composition involved fabrication of metallic fuel rods up to 3 feet in length in Russia. Fabrication of full-length (approximately 3.5 to 4.5 meters) PWR metallic fuel rods has yet to be demonstrated. We plan to demonstrate fabrication of full-length rods using surrogate materials in 2019.
 
Overview of the Nuclear Power Industry
 
Presently, nuclear power provides approximately 7% of the world’s energy, including approximately 11% of the world’s electricity. According to the World Nuclear Association, as of March 1, 2019 there were 450 operable nuclear power plants worldwide, mostly light water reactors, with the most common types being PWRs, boiling-water reactors (BWRs), and VVER reactors. Nuclear power provides a non-fossil fuel, low-carbon energy solution that can meet baseload electricity needs.
 
Due to substantial project risks and the significant upfront capital commitment associated with building new reactors, many nuclear utilities in deregulated markets choose to optimize their existing generating capacity through increasing their capacity utilization factor, power uprates and plant life extensions. We expect this trend to continue, particularly in the mature nuclear markets with significant existing nuclear capacity. We expect most of the new build activity to occur in emerging nuclear markets.
 
Of the world’s existing reactors currently in operation, PWRs (including Russian-designed VVERs) account for more than half of the net operating capacity, with BWRs being the second most prevalent and accounting for another 15-20%.
 
Of the nuclear reactors currently under construction, we estimate over 80% are either PWRs or VVERs with a rated electric power output of 1,000 megawatts (“MWe”) or greater.
 
Utilities have embraced power uprates as a cost-effective way to increase their generation capacity. While the efforts thus far have occurred mostly in the United States, we believe there is a large, untapped worldwide market for power uprates. The incentive to proceed with longer operating cycles and/or power uprates of up to 10% level is significant since there are few changes required to implement the power uprate, and the changes that are required are relatively inexpensive. The limiting factor at the moment is the fuel. 
 
In some instances, utilities will modify and/or replace components in order to accommodate a higher power level. Technical analyses must demonstrate that the proposed plant configuration remains safe and that measures to protect the health and safety of the public continue to be effective. These analyses, which span many technical disciplines, are reviewed and approved by the regulator before a power uprate can be performed.
 


12

 
The utility will conduct an economic analysis to evaluate the potential financial benefits of the proposed uprate. Typically, power uprates enable utilities to increase their generating capacity at a cost significantly less than the cost of building a new plant. In many cases, power uprates can be completed in months as opposed to the several years required for new build, thus the invested dollars begin producing revenue shortly after they are spent. Power uprates, therefore, represent an efficient use of capital.
 
Most nuclear power plants originally had a licensed lifetime of 25 to 40 years, but engineering assessments have established that many can operate much longer. In the US, approximately 60 reactors have been granted license extensions to continue operating for a total of 60 years. Most of the plants that have not already requested a license extension are expected to apply in the near future. A license extension at about the 30-year mark requires additional capital expenditure for the replacement of worn equipment and outdated control systems. Multiple utilities have stated plans to apply to the NRC for additional 20 years of licensed lifetime, up to a total of 80 years per reactor.
 
The technical and economic feasibility of replacing major reactor components, such as steam generators in PWRs, has been demonstrated. The increased revenue generated from extending the lifetime of existing plants is attractive to utilities, especially in view of the difficulties in obtaining public acceptance of constructing replacement nuclear capacity.
 
Almost all of the new build reactor designs are either Generation III or Generation III+ type reactors. The primary difference from second-generation designs is that many incorporate passive or inherent safety features which require no active controls or operational intervention to avoid accidents in the event of malfunction. Many of these passive systems rely on gravity, natural convection, or resistance to high temperatures.
 
Influence of the Accident at Fukushima, Japan and New International Nuclear Build
 
The nuclear accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan following the strong earthquake and massive tsunami that occurred on March 11, 2011 increased public opposition to nuclear power, resulting in a slowdown in, or, in some cases, a complete halt to, new construction of nuclear power plants and an early shut down of existing power plants in certain countries. As a result, some countries that were considering launching new domestic nuclear power programs before the Fukushima accident have delayed or cancelled preparatory activities they were planning to undertake as part of such programs. This has diminished the number of consulting opportunities that we could compete for globally, at least in the near-term. In addition, the Fukushima accident appears to have shrunk the projected size of the global nuclear power market in 2025-2030 as reflected in the most recent reference case projections published by the World Nuclear Association. At the same time, the event has brought a greater emphasis on safety to the forefront that may be beneficial to us because our metallic fuel provides improved safety and fuel performance during normal operation and design-basis accidents.
Our Intellectual Property 
 
Our nuclear fuel technologies are protected by multiple US and international patents. Set forth below are the patents, which we consider material to our business based on our current plans, all of which we have licensed to Enfission:

We also own a number of US and international patents associated with fuel assembly designs for all-uranium seed and blanket fuel for existing plants and new build reactors and thorium-based seed and blanket fuel for both existing and new build reactors, which we do not consider material, individually or collectively, based on our current business plan. In addition to our patent portfolio, we also own trademarks to Lightbridge and Thorium Power corporate names and the Lightbridge logo.
 
Our Consulting Business
 
Although we discontinued our consulting business segment in 2018, we may opportunistically provide nuclear power consulting and strategic advisory services to commercial and governmental entities worldwide. Our consulting business in the past was primarily engaged in the business of assisting commercial and governmental entities globally with developing and expanding their nuclear industry capabilities and infrastructure. We can provide integrated strategic advice across a range of expertise areas including, for example, regulatory development, nuclear reactor site selection, procurement and deployment, reactor and fuel technology, international relations, program management and infrastructure development.
 
We only engage with commercial entities and governments that are dedicated to non-proliferative and transparent nuclear programs.
 
Our consulting services are expert and relationship based, with particular emphasis on key decision makers in senior positions within governments or companies, as well as focus on overall management of nuclear energy programs. We believe that our independence, experience, expertise, reputation and segment focus enable us to compete effectively as a strategic advisor for governments wishing to develop a new civil nuclear program.
 
Our major challenge in pursuing our consulting business is that the decision-making process for nuclear power programs typically involves careful consideration by many parties and therefore requires significant time. Many of the potential clients that could benefit from our services are in regions of the world where tensions surrounding nuclear energy are high, or in countries where public opinion plays an important role.
 
Financial information about our nuclear fuel technology and consulting is incorporated by reference from Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Employees
 
Our business model is to limit the number of our full-time employees and to rely on individual independent contractors, outside agencies and technical facilities with specific skills to assist with various business functions including, but not limited to, corporate overhead, personnel, research and development, and government relations. This model limits overhead costs and allows us to draw upon resources that are specifically tailored to our internal and external (client) needs. As of December 31, 2018, we had eleven full-time employees. We utilize a network of independent contractors available for deployment for specialized consulting assignments. We believe that our relationship with our employees and contractors is satisfactory.
