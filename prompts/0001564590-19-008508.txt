ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview 
 We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on August 25, 1999, and are located in Redwood City, California. On May 8, 2017, we received stockholder approval to amend our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to change our name from “Capnia, Inc.” to “Soleno Therapeutics, Inc.” We initially established our operations as a diversified healthcare company that developed and commercialized innovative diagnostics, devices and therapeutics addressing unmet medical needs, which consisted of: precision metering of gas flow technology marketed as Serenz® Allergy Relief, or Serenz; the CoSense® End-Tidal Carbon Monoxide (ETCO) Monitor, or CoSense, which measures ETCO and aids in the detection of excessive hemolysis, a condition in which red blood cells degrade rapidly and which can lead to adverse neurological outcomes; and, products that included temperature probes, scales, surgical tables, and patient surfaces.
 On March 7, 2017, we completed our merger, or the Merger, with Essentialis, Inc., a Delaware corporation, or Essentialis, in accordance with the Merger Agreement by and between Soleno Therapeutics and Essentialis dated December 22, 2016, or the Merger Agreement. After the Merger, our primary focus has been the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for the treatment of rare diseases. Essentialis was a privately held, clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the development of breakthrough medicines for the treatment of rare diseases where there is increased mortality and risk of cardiovascular and endocrine complications. Prior to the Merger, Essentialis’s efforts were focused primarily on developing and testing product candidates that target the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, a metabolically regulated membrane protein whose modulation has the potential to impact a wide range of rare metabolic, cardiovascular, and CNS diseases. Essentialis has tested Diazoxide Choline Controlled Release tablets, or DCCR, as a treatment for Prader-Willi Syndrome, or PWS, a complex metabolic/neurobehavioral disorder. DCCR has orphan designation for the treatment of PWS in the United States, or U.S., as well as in the European Union, or E.U. 
 Subsequent to the Merger with Essentialis, we determined to divest, sell or dispose of our business efforts focused on the development and commercialization of our Serenz and CoSense technologies. Our current research and development efforts are primarily focused on advancing our lead candidate, DCCR tablets for the treatment of PWS, through late-stage clinical development. 
 Diazoxide Choline Controlled-Release Tablets 
 DCCR tablets consist of the active ingredient diazoxide choline, a choline salt of diazoxide, which is a benzothiadiazine. Once solubilized from the formulation, diazoxide choline is rapidly hydrolyzed to diazoxide prior to absorption. Diazoxide acts by stimulating ion flux through ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP). The KATP channel links the cellular energy status to the membrane potential. Diazoxide appears to act on signs and symptoms of PWS in a variety of ways. Agonizing the KATP channel in the hypothalamus has the potential to address hyperphagia, which is an insatiable desire to eat. Agonizing the channel in GABAergic neurons improves GABA signaling and may reduce aggressive behaviors. 
 In the U.S., diazoxide was first approved in 1973 as an intravenous formulation for the emergency treatment of malignant hypertension. In 1976, immediate-release oral formulations, including Proglycem® Oral Suspension and Capsules, or Proglycem, were approved and there has been nearly 40 years of use of the 2-3 times a day orally-administered drug in the approved indications. In addition to the short-term use (<3 months) in the approved indications for Proglycem, there are also extensive data on chronic use in children with congenital hyperinsulinism, or CI, and in adults with insulinoma. Insulinoma patients tend to be older, with 50% of them over 70 years old. The average duration of use of Proglycem in CI and insulinoma patients is 5 years and 7 years, respectively. 
 DCCR tablets were formulated with the goals of improving the safety and bioavailability of orally-administered diazoxide and reducing the frequency of daily dosing required by current diazoxide formulations. Diazoxide choline is formulated into an extended-release tablet that lowers peak plasma concentration compared to diazoxide oral suspension and slows release of diazoxide from DCCR, making it suitable for once-a-day dosing. The control of release and absorption of diazoxide achieved using DCCR results in very level and consistent intraday circulating drug levels, and consistent levels of diazoxide in tissues that are the site of action of the drug (the hypothalamus). In circulation, diazoxide is extensively protein bound. Only unbound diazoxide is active. The 
 2


consistent absorption of diazoxide may also result in some level of disequilibrium in protein binding, potentiating the therapeutic response to treatment. The controlled rate of absorption, level intraday circulating drug levels and the disequilibrium in protein binding likely results in the potential for improved therapeutic response to treatment. Avoiding significant swings in circulating drug levels also has the potential to reduce adverse events which are often associated with transiently high circulating drug levels that often follow rapid absorption from immediate release product formulations. 
 Prader-Willi Syndrome 
 PWS is a rare, complex neurobehavioral/metabolic disorder, which is due to the absence of normally active paternally expressed genes from the chromosome 15q11-q13 region. PWS is an imprinted condition with 70-75% of the cases due to a de novo deletion in the paternally inherited chromosome 15 11-q13 region, 20-30% from maternal uniparental disomy 15, or UPD, where the affected individual inherited 2 copies of chromosome from their mother and no copy from their father, and the remaining 2-5% from either microdeletions or epimutations of the imprinting center (i.e., imprinting defects; IDs). The committee on genetics of the American Academy of Pediatrics states PWS affects both genders equally and occurs in people from all geographic regions; its estimated incidence is 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 25,000 live births. The mortality rate among PWS patients is 3% a year across all ages and 7% in those over 30 years of age. The mean age of death reported from a 40-year mortality study in the U.S. was 29.5 ± 15 years (range: 2 months - 67 years). 
 In addition to hyperphagia, typical behavioral disturbances associated with PWS include skin picking, difficulty with change in routine, obsessive and compulsive behaviors and mood fluctuations. The majority of older adolescent and adult PWS patients display some degree of aggressive or threatening behaviors including being verbally aggressive, seeking to intimidate others, being physically aggressive including attacking others and destroying property, throwing temper tantrums and directing rage or anger at others. 
 PWS is typically thought of as a genetic obesity, which is often significant. With increasing awareness among families and caregivers leading to significant control of food intake, many PWS patients today may not be obese. However, they remain hyperphagic and will typically have a higher body fat and lower lean body mass content. They are prone to cardiometabolic issues such as abnormal lipid profiles, diabetes and hypertension. Other complications in PWS patients include greater risk for autistic symptomatology, psychosis, sleep disorders, distress, food stealing, withdrawal, sulking, nail-biting, hoarding and overeating, and more pronounced attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms, insistence on sameness, and their association with maladaptive conduct problems. The reported rates of psychotic symptoms, between 6% and 28%, are higher than those for individuals with other intellectual disabilities. Individuals with PWS show age-related increases in internalizing problems such as anxiety, sadness and a feeling of low self-esteem. Males are at greater risk for aggressive behavior, depression and dependent personality disorder and overall severity of psychopathology than females. Cognitively, most individuals with PWS function in the mild intellectually disability range with a mean IQ in the 60s to low 70s. The combination of food-related preoccupations and numerous maladaptive behaviors make it difficult for individuals with PWS to perform to their IQ potential. 
 Unmet Medical Needs in PWS 
 The target indication for DCCR is the treatment of PWS. Currently, the only approved treatment related to PWS is growth hormone which addresses the short stature associated with PWS, but has no effect on hyperphagia. A global patient survey conducted by the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research (n=779), found that 96.5% of respondents rated reducing hunger and 91.2% rated improving behavior around food as very important or most important symptom to be relieved by a new treatment. Physical function and body composition symptoms for which a high percentage of respondents indicated were very important or most important included: 92.9% indicated improving metabolic health (reduces fat / increases muscle) and 81.3% indicated the related symptom of improving activity and stamina. The behavioral and cognitive symptoms rated by respondents as very or most important were: 85.2% indicated reduction of obsessive/compulsive behavior, 84.6% indicated improvements to intellect/development, and 83.2% indicated reduction of temper outburst severity and frequency. 
 3


Therefore, there is a clear unmet need in the treatment of PWS to reduce hyperphagia and improve behaviors around food, and to reduce other behavioral and cognitive impacts of this complex disease. In addition, improving metabolic health is also an important unmet need. 
 Clinical Trial of DCCR for PWS 
 A Phase III clinical trial is currently being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DCCR in patients with genetically-confirmed PWS.  This study, DESTINY PWS, is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with enrollment of approximately 105 children and adults with PWS.  Subjects who complete the 15-week DESTINY PWS study may enroll in a long-term, safety extension study.  
 A Phase II clinical trial has been conducted to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of DCCR in the treatment of PWS subjects. This study, PC025, was a single-center, randomized withdrawal study and enrolled 13 overweight and obese subjects with genetically-confirmed PWS who were between the ages of 11 and 21. The first phase of the study was open label during which subjects were initiated on a DCCR dose that was escalated every 14 days at the discretion of the investigator. Any subject who showed an increase in resting energy expenditure and/or a reduction in hyperphagia from baseline at certain study visits would be designated a responder, whereas all others would be designated non-responders. This 10-week open-label treatment phase was followed by randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, withdrawal phase. Responders were randomized in a 1:1 ratio either to continue on active treatment at the dose they were treated with, or to the placebo equivalent of that dose for an additional 4 weeks. Of the 13 subjects who enrolled, 11 were designated as responders; the remaining two subjects had discontinued prematurely. 
 Key efficacy results included a statistically significant reduction in hyperphagia from baseline to the end of the open-label treatment phase. In addition, greater improvement in hyperphagia from baseline was observed in those subjects with moderate to severe hyperphagia who received higher DCCR doses. There was a significant improvement in the number of subjects reporting one or more aggressive and destructive behaviors. During the open-label treatment phase, a mean decrease in body fat mass and increases in lean body mass and lean body mass / fat mass ratio were seen. These changes were associated with a statistically significant reduction in waist circumference, consistent with the loss of visceral fat. Statistically significant reductions from baseline in LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol were observed. The change in triglycerides, while marked, did not reach statistical significance. 
 Safety of DCCR in the Treatment of PWS 
 Many of the adverse events were common medical complications of PWS including ear and respiratory infections, hypersomnia, peripheral edema, skin picking and constipation. The most common adverse events that occurred during the study, regardless of the relationship to DCCR, included peripheral edema, hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance, upper respiratory tract infections, ear infection, headache, somnolence, constipation, and bruises. 
 Regulatory Status of DCCR for the Treatment of PWS 
 Diazoxide choline is being developed in the U.S. under a current IND and is designated as an Orphan Drug for the treatment of PWS.  We announced successful completion of a scientific advice meeting with the FDA on July 5, 2017.  On September 25, 2017, we announced receipt of advice from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) regarding DCCR for the treatment of PWS.  On October 12, 2017, we announced the receipt of a positive opinion from the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) of the EMA recommending diazoxide choline for the treatment of PWS.  This designation was granted by the European Commission as EU/3/17/1941.  We announced successful completion and receipt of minutes from an End-of-Phase II meeting with the FDA and confirmed alignment on key aspects of the Phase III study design, including the primary endpoint and duration of the trial on February 20, 2018.  On July 30, 2018, we announced that DCCR was granted “Fast Track” designation for the treatment of PWS. Fast Track designation is intended to provide patients with serious conditions and unmet medical needs access to new drugs earlier by assisting their development and accelerating their review by the FDA. Fast Track designation allows additional meetings with the FDA to discuss our development plan to ensure the appropriate data are collected and encourages 
 4


frequent written communication with the FDA regarding design of clinical trials and use of biomarkers. If certain criteria are met, DCCR may be eligible for “Accelerated Approval” and “Priority Review” and also “Rolling Review”, which would allow us to submit to the FDA sections of our New Drug Application (NDA) as they are finished instead of waiting for all sections to be completed before submitting the marketing application.
 Market opportunity 
 An estimated 300,000 to 400,000 individuals worldwide have PWS. An overall prevalence ranging from 1:15,000 to 1:25,000 has been reported regardless of geography or ethnicity. The numbers of identified PWS patients is growing at a rate that is higher than the rate of general population because of improved rates of diagnosis. We anticipate that DCCR could be the first effective treatment for hyperphagia in PWS to reach the market both in the U.S. and Europe and would therefore be likely to be used in a large proportion of patients. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Newly diagnosed PWS patients tend to be treated by a multi-disciplinary team led by a pediatric endocrinologist. Many patients receive care at larger clinics devoted to PWS in university-associated hospitals or at children’s hospitals. This concentration of care allows us to consider marketing DCCR without a partner by assembling a small, dedicated salesforce to target the limited number of major PWS treatment centers in the U.S. In contrast to the situation in the U.S., we are likely to need to identify a marketing partner for DCCR in Europe, Japan, and the rest of the world. The final decision on sales and marketing strategy will be made at a later date.
Pricing 
 We have not conducted a formal pricing analysis of DCCR in PWS. We anticipate that pricing at launch may be influenced by the product label negotiated with the FDA, pharmacoeconomic data developed to support pricing and the potential for greater sales under negotiated government contracts. 
Competition 
 Currently, the only approved products for PWS are Genotropin® (somatropin), and Omnitrope® (somatropin) which are approved only for growth failure due to PWS. There are no approved products to address PWS-associated hyperphagia and behaviors, or for any other abnormalities associated with the disease. However, to our knowledge, there are a number of therapeutic products at various stages of clinical development for the treatment of PWS, including for hyperphagia, by Levo Therapeutics, Inc., Millendo Therapeutics, Inc., Zafgen, Inc., Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Saniona AB, Insys Therapeutics, Inc., and GLWL Research, Inc. 
Manufacturing 
 Pharmaceuticals 
 Our manufacturing strategy is to contract with third parties to manufacture our clinical and commercial API and drug product supplies. 
 The formulation and processes used to manufacture our products are proprietary, being covered by multiple issued U.S. patents and counterparts in other regions of the world, and we have agreements with various third-party manufacturers that are intended to restrict these manufacturers from using or revealing any unpublished proprietary information. 
 Our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners are independent entities who are subject to their own operational and financial risks over which we have no control. If we or any of these third-party manufacturers fail to perform as required, this could cause delays in our clinical trials and regulatory applications and submission. 
 5


Regulation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Processes 
 The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. We and our third-party manufacturers are subject to current Good Manufacturing Practices, which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping and quality standards as defined by the FDA and the EMA. Similar regulations and requirements are in effect in other countries. 
Intellectual Property 
 DCCR Patent Portfolio 
 Our patent portfolio surrounding DCCR consists of five issued U.S. patents, one allowed U.S. patent and 10 pending U.S. applications. Our issued U.S. patents (no.’s 7,572,789, 7,799,777, 9,381,202, 9,757,384, and 9,782,416) expire in 2026 to 2035. We also have one or more issued patents covering the product in the E.U., Canada, Japan, China, India, Hong Kong and Australia, and numerous patent applications being prosecuted at the national level in all major pharma markets around the world. The issued patents and pending patent applications include protection of:

Government Regulation - Pharmaceuticals 
 Our operations and activities are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the United States and in other countries in which we elect to develop and/or commercialize our products. Our developmental drug products are subject to rigorous regulation. Federal and state statutes and regulations govern the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. As a result of these regulations, product development and product approval processes are very expensive and time consuming. 
 A country’s regulatory agency, such as the FDA in the United States, or a region’s agency, such as the EMA for the European Union, must approve a drug before it can be sold in the respective country or countries. The general process for drug approval in the United States is summarized below. Many other countries, including countries in the European Union and Japan, have very similar regulatory approval processes. 
 Nonclinical Testing 
 Before a drug candidate in can be tested in humans, it must be studied in laboratory experiments and in animals to generate data to support the drug candidate’s potential benefits and/or safety. Additional nonclinical testing may be required during the clinical development process such as reproductive toxicology and juvenile toxicology studies. Carcinogenicity studies in two species are generally required for products intended for long-term use. 
 6


Investigational New Drug Exemption Application (IND) 
 The results of initial nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. If the FDA does not identify significant issues during the initial 30-day IND review, the drug candidate can then be studied in human clinical trials to determine if the drug candidate is safe and effective. Each clinical trial protocol and/or amendment, new nonclinical data, and/or new or revised manufacturing information must be submitted to the IND, and the FDA has 30 days to complete its review of each submission. 
Clinical Trials 
 These clinical trials involve three separate phases that often overlap, can take many years and are very expensive. These three phases, which are subject to considerable regulation, are as follows: 
 Phase I Studies. During Phase I studies, researchers test a new drug in normal volunteers who are healthy. In most cases, 20 to 80 healthy volunteers or people with the disease/condition participate in Phase 1. Phase I studies are closely monitored and gather information about how a drug interacts with the human body. Researchers adjust dosing schemes based on animal data to find out how much of a drug the body can tolerate and what its acute side effects are. As a Phase I trial continues, researchers answer research questions related to how it works in the body, the side effects associated with increased dosage, and early information about how effective it is to determine how best to administer the drug to limit risks and maximize possible benefits. This is important to the design of Phase II studies. 
 Phase II Studies. In Phase II studies, researchers administer the drug to a group of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug is being developed. Typically involving up to a few hundred patients, these studies are not large enough to show whether the drug will be beneficial. Instead, Phase II studies provide researchers with additional safety data. Researchers use these data to refine research questions, develop research methods, and design new Phase III research protocols. 
 Phase III Studies. Researchers design Phase III studies to demonstrate whether or not a product offers a treatment benefit to a specific population. Sometimes known as pivotal studies, these studies generally involve a larger number of participants than do Phase II studies. Phase III studies provide most of the safety data. In Phase II studies, it is possible that less common side effects might have gone undetected. Because these studies are larger and longer in duration, the results are more likely to show long-term or rare side effects. 
 For each clinical trial, an independent IRB or independent ethics committee (IEC), covering each site proposing to conduct a clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences at that site and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, other heath authority, the IRB/IEC, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or for failure to comply with the IRB/IEC’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the NIH-maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov, key parameters of certain clinical trials. 
 At any point in this process, the development of a drug candidate can be stopped for a number of reasons including safety concerns and lack of treatment benefit. We cannot be certain that any clinical trials that we are currently conducting or any that we conduct in the future will be completed successfully or within any specified time period. We may choose, or FDA may require us, to delay or suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or if the drug candidate does not appear to have sufficient treatment benefit. 
 7


FDA Approval Process 
 When we believe that the data from our clinical trials show an adequate level of safety and efficacy, we would intend to submit an application to market the drug for a particular use, an NDA or BLA with the FDA. The FDA may hold a public hearing where an independent advisory committee of expert advisors asks additional questions and makes recommendations regarding the drug candidate. This committee makes recommendations to the FDA that are not binding but are generally followed by the FDA. If the FDA agrees that the compound has met the required level of safety and efficacy for a particular use, it will allow the drug product to be marketed in the United States and sold for that use. It is not unusual, however, for the FDA to reject an application because it believes that the risks of the drug candidate outweigh the purported benefit or because it does not believe that the data submitted are reliable or conclusive. The FDA may also issue a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. CRLs generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 The FDA may also require Phase IV non-registrational studies to explore scientific questions to further characterize safety and efficacy during commercial use of our drug. The FDA may also require us to provide additional data or information, improve our manufacturing processes, procedures or facilities or may require extensive surveillance to monitor the safety or benefits of our product candidates if it determines that our filing does not contain adequate evidence of the safety and benefits of the drug. In addition, even if the FDA approves a drug, it could limit the uses of the drug. The FDA can withdraw approvals if it does not believe that we are complying with regulatory standards or if problems are uncovered or occur after approval. 
 In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each drug, we obtain FDA approval of the manufacturing facilities for companies who manufacture our drugs for us. These facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. The FDA must also approve foreign establishments that manufacture products to be sold in the United States and these facilities are subject to periodic regulatory inspection. 
 Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval testing, including Phase IV studies, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and, even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the sponsor may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require the development of additional data or conduct of additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. 
 Drugs that treat serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions that are not adequately addressed by existing drugs, and for which the development program is designed to address the unmet medical need, may be designated as fast track and/or breakthrough candidates by the FDA and may be eligible for accelerated and priority review. 
 Drugs that are developed for rare diseases (i.e., in the U.S., the disease or condition has an prevalence of less than 200,000 persons; in the E.U., the prevalence of the condition must be not more than 5 in 10,000) can be designated as “Orphan Drugs”. In the U.S., orphan-designated drugs are granted up to 7-year market exclusivity. In the E.U., products granted orphan designation are subject to reduced fees for protocol assistance, marketing authorization applications, inspections before authorization, applications for changes to marketing authorizations, and annual fees, access to the centralized authorization procedure, and 10 years of market exclusivity.

Ongoing Regulation 
 Once a pharmaceutical product is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, EMA, and other health authorities, including, among other things, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP or QSR and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market, though the FDA must provide an application holder with notice and an opportunity for a hearing in order to withdraw its approval of an application. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug and device products that are placed on the market. The Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, also regulates the promotion and advertising of consumer products.  While physicians may prescribe drugs and devices for off label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Manufacturers may not promote a drug that is still under development and has not been approved by the FDA. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 Drugs are also subject to extensive regulation outside of the United States. In the European Union, there is a centralized approval procedure that authorizes marketing of a product in all countries of the European Union through a single application and review process. If this centralized approval procedure is not used, approval in one country of the European Union can be used to obtain approval in another country of the European Union under one of two simplified application processes: the mutual recognition procedure or the decentralized procedure, both of which rely on the principle of mutual recognition. After receiving regulatory approval through any of the European registration procedures, separate pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required in most countries. The European Union also has requirements for approval of manufacturing facilities for all products that are approved for sale by the European regulatory authorities.

Additional Government Regulations 
 HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws 
 HIPAA, established for the first-time comprehensive protection for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations, or “Covered Entities”: health plans, healthcare clearing houses, and healthcare providers which conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically. Covered Entities and their Business Associates must have in place administrative, physical, and technical standards to guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information. Because we are a healthcare provider and we conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically, we are presently a Covered Entity, and we must have in place the administrative, physical, and technical safeguards required by HIPAA, HITECH and their implementing regulations. Additionally, some state laws impose privacy protections more stringent than HIPAA. Most of the institutions and physicians from which we obtain biological specimens that we use in our research and validation work are Covered Entities and must obtain proper authorization from their patients for the subsequent use of those samples and associated clinical information. We may perform future activities that may implicate HIPAA, such as providing clinical laboratory testing services or entering into specific kinds of relationships with a Covered Entity or a Business Associate of a Covered Entity. 
 If we or our operations are found to be in violation of HIPAA, HITECH or their implementing regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, fines, and exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against Covered Entities, their Business Associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
 Our activities must also comply with other applicable privacy laws. For example, there are also international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain tissue samples and associated patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans. 
 Federal and State Billing and Fraud and Abuse Laws 
 Antifraud Laws/Overpayments. As participants in federal and state healthcare programs, we are subject to numerous federal and state antifraud and abuse laws. Many of these antifraud laws are broad in scope, and neither the courts nor government agencies have extensively interpreted these laws. Prohibitions under some of these laws include: 

• | the submission, or causing the submission of, false claims or false information to government programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | deceptive or fraudulent conduct;
--+---------------------------------


• | performing medically unnecessary procedures; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | prohibitions in defrauding private sector health insurers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 We could be subject to substantial penalties for violations of these laws, including denial of payment and refunds, suspension of payments from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs and exclusion from participation in the federal healthcare programs, as well as civil monetary and criminal penalties and imprisonment. One of these statutes, the False Claims Act, is a key enforcement tool used by the government to combat healthcare fraud. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. In addition, violations of the federal physician self-referral laws, such as the Stark laws discussed below, may also violate false claims laws. Liability under the False Claims Act can result in treble damages and imposition of penalties. For example, we could be subject to 
penalties of $11,181 
to $22,363 per false claim, and each use of our product could potentially be part of a different claim submitted to the government. Separately, the HHS office of the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, can exclude providers found liable under the False Claims Act from participating in federally funded healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. The steep penalties that may be imposed on laboratories and other providers under this statute may be disproportionate to the relatively small dollar amounts of the claims made by these providers for reimbursement. In addition, even the threat of being excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs can have significant financial consequences on a provider.

Numerous federal and state agencies enforce the antifraud and abuse laws. In addition, private insurers may also bring private actions. In some circumstances, private whistleblowers are authorized to bring fraud suits on behalf of the government against providers and are entitled to receive a portion of any final recovery. 
 Federal and State “Self-Referral” and “Anti-Kickback” Restrictions 
 Self-Referral law. We are subject to a federal “self-referral” law, commonly referred to as the “Stark” law, which provides that physicians who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with a laboratory are prohibited from making a referral to that laboratory for laboratory tests reimbursable by Medicare, and also prohibits laboratories from submitting a claim for Medicare payments for laboratory tests referred by physicians who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with the testing laboratory. The Stark law contains a number of specific exceptions which, if met, permit physicians who have ownership or compensation arrangements with a testing laboratory to make referrals to that laboratory and permit the laboratory to submit claims for Medicare payments for laboratory tests performed pursuant to such referrals. 
 We are subject to comparable state laws, some of which apply to all payors regardless of source of payment, and do not contain identical exceptions to the Stark law. For example, we are subject to a North Carolina self-referral law that prohibits a physician investor from referring to us any patients covered by private, employer-funded or state and federal employee health plans. The North Carolina self-referral law contains few exceptions for physician investors in securities that have not been acquired through public trading but will generally permit us to accept referrals from physician investors who buy their shares in the public market. 
 We have several stockholders who are physicians in a position to make referrals to us. We have included within our compliance plan procedures to identify requests for testing services from physician investors and we do not bill Medicare, or any other federal program, or seek reimbursement from other third-party payors, for these tests. The self-referral laws may cause some physicians who would otherwise use our laboratory to use other laboratories for their testing. 
 Providers are subject to sanctions for claims submitted for each service that is furnished based on a referral prohibited under the federal self-referral laws. These sanctions include denial of payment and refunds, civil monetary payments and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and civil monetary penalties, and they may also include penalties for applicable violations of the False Claims Act, which may require payment of up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties 
of $11,181 
to $22,363 for each separate false claim. Similarly, sanctions for violations under the North Carolina self-referral laws include refunds and monetary penalties. 
 Anti-Kickback Statute. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the PPACA, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes, effective March 23, 2010. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA provides that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Sanctions for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may include imprisonment and other criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.

The OIG has criticized a number of the business practices in the clinical laboratory industry as potentially implicating the Anti-Kickback Statute, including compensation arrangements intended to induce referrals between laboratories and entities from which they receive, or to which they make, referrals. In addition, the OIG has indicated that “dual charge” billing practices that are intended to induce the referral of patients reimbursed by federal healthcare programs may violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. 
 Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and do not contain identical safe harbors. For example, North Carolina has an anti-kickback statute that prohibits healthcare providers from paying any financial compensation for recommending or securing patient referrals. Penalties for violations of this statute include license suspension or revocation or other disciplinary action. Other states have similar anti-kickback prohibitions. 
 Both the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the North Carolina anti-kickback law are broad in scope. The anti-kickback laws clearly prohibit payments for patient referrals. Under a broad interpretation, these laws could also prohibit a broad array of practices involving remuneration where one party is a potential source of referrals for the other. 
 If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. To the extent that any product we make is sold in a foreign country in the future, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. To reduce the risks associated with these various laws and governmental regulations, we have implemented a compliance plan. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly. 
 U.S. Healthcare Reform 
 In March 2010, the PPACA was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Beginning in August 2013, the PPACA and its implementing regulations requires drug and medical device manufacturers to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any “transfer of value” made or distributed to such entities, as well as any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to report this information to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on an annual basis.  Failure to make timely reports to CMS can subject us to significant civil penalties. Various states have also implemented regulations prohibiting certain financial interactions with healthcare professionals or mandating public disclosure of such financial interactions. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.

Other Corporate Transactions 
 Joint Venture Agreement and Issuance of Shares by Capnia, Inc. 
 In December 2017, we entered into a joint venture agreement, or the Joint Venture Agreement, with OptAsia Healthcare Limited, a Hong Kong company, or OAHL, with respect to CoSense with the intent to sell shares of Capnia, Inc., our previously wholly-owned subsidiary into which our CoSense business had been transferred, to OAHL. Under the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement, OAHL agreed to invest up to $2.2 million to purchase shares of our Capnia subsidiary and as a result of this investment, when made, Capnia would no longer be our wholly-owned subsidiary. Going forward, OAHL would be responsible for funding the operations of Capnia. In addition, OAHL has the option to buy our remaining interest in Capnia as set forth in the Joint Venture Agreement. 
 During October 2018, we determined and agreed that the cumulative investment made by OAHL exceeded $1.2 million as dictated by the Joint Venture Agreement between us and OAHL. Accordingly, on October 16, 2018, Capnia issued 1,690,322 shares of its common stock to OAHL, representing 53% of its outstanding shares. After the issuance by Capnia, we no longer held a controlling interest in Capnia. The transfer of the 53% ownership stake resulted in the deconsolidation of Capnia from our financial statements and a $1.9 million gain recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our remaining 47% investment in Capnia is classified as an equity method investment.

, together with the shares of common stock are 
referred to as the 2018 Resale Shares. We also granted certain registration rights to these stockholders, pursuant to which, among other things, we
 will prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement to register for resale the 2018 
Resale Shares prior to March 31, 2019.
